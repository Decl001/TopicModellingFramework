But maybe 2007 will be the year we start the move toward universal coverage.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/opinion/01krugman.html,780,The U.S. health care system is a scandal and a disgrace. But maybe 2007 will be the year we start the move toward universal coverage.,"The U.S. health care system is a scandal and a disgrace. But maybe, just maybe, 2007 will be the year we start the move toward universal coverage.
In 2005, almost 47 million Americans — including more than 8 million children — were uninsured, and many more had inadequate insurance.
Apologists for our system try to minimize the significance of these numbers. Many of the uninsured, asserted the 2004 Economic Report of the President, “remain uninsured as a matter of choice.”
And then you wake up. A scathing article in yesterday’s Los Angeles Times described how insurers refuse to cover anyone with even the slightest hint of a pre-existing condition. People have been denied insurance for reasons that range from childhood asthma to a “past bout of jock itch.”
Some say that we can’t afford universal health care, even though every year lack of insurance plunges millions of Americans into severe financial distress and sends thousands to an early grave. But every other advanced country somehow manages to provide all its citizens with essential care. The only reason universal coverage seems hard to achieve here is the spectacular inefficiency of the U.S. health care system.
Americans spend more on health care per person than anyone else — almost twice as much as the French, whose medical care is among the best in the world. Yet we have the highest infant mortality and close to the lowest life expectancy of any wealthy nation. How do we do it?
Part of the answer is that our fragmented system has much higher administrative costs than the straightforward government insurance systems prevalent in the rest of the advanced world. As Anna Bernasek pointed out in yesterday’s New York Times, besides the overhead of private insurance companies, “there’s an enormous amount of paperwork required of American doctors and hospitals that simply doesn’t exist in countries like Canada or Britain.”
In addition, insurers often refuse to pay for preventive care, even though such care saves a lot of money in the long run, because those long-run savings won’t necessarily redound to their benefit. And the fragmentation of the American system explains why we lag far behind other nations in the use of electronic medical records, which both reduce costs and save lives by preventing many medical errors.
The truth is that we can afford to cover the uninsured. What we can’t afford is to keep going without a universal health care system.
If it were up to me, we’d have a Medicare-like system for everyone, paid for by a dedicated tax that for most people would be less than they or their employers currently pay in insurance premiums. This would, at a stroke, cover the uninsured, greatly reduce administrative costs and make it much easier to work on preventive care.
Such a system would leave people with the right to choose their own doctors, and with other choices as well: Medicare currently lets people apply their benefits to H.M.O.’s run by private insurance companies, and there’s no reason why similar options shouldn’t be available in a system of Medicare for all. But everyone would be in the system, one way or another.
Can we get there from here? Health care reform is in the air. Democrats in Congress are talking about providing health insurance to all children. John Edwards began his presidential campaign with a call for universal health care.
And there’s real action at the state level. Inspired by the Massachusetts plan to cover all its uninsured residents, politicians in other states are talking about adopting similar plans. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has introduced a Massachusetts-type plan for the nation as a whole.
But now is the time to warn against plans that try to cover the uninsured without taking on the fundamental sources of our health system’s inefficiency. What’s wrong with both the Massachusetts plan and Senator Wyden’s plan is that they don’t operate like Medicare; instead, they funnel the money through private insurance companies.
Everyone knows why: would-be reformers are trying to avoid too strong a backlash from the insurance industry and other players who profit from our current system’s irrationality.
But look at what happened to Bill Clinton. He rejected a single-payer approach, even though he understood its merits, in favor of a complex plan that was supposed to co-opt private insurance companies by giving them a largely gratuitous role. And the reward for this “pragmatism” was that insurance companies went all-out against his plan anyway, with the notorious “Harry and Louise” ads that, yes, mocked the plan’s complexity.
Now we have another chance for fundamental health care reform. Let’s not blow that chance with a pre-emptive surrender to the special interests.

Now Applied Digital, of Delray Beach, Fla., is about to test Wall Street’s interest with an initial public offering as soon as Thursday in the nascent business,  the VeriChip Corporation. But some analysts are finding the effort to raise about $30 million from public investors nearly as disconcerting as the privacy advocates find the technology.
“People ask if there is a bubble in the I.P.O. market, and I say no,” said Francis Gaskins, president of IPODesktop.com in the Marina del Rey section of Los Angeles, which tracks companies selling shares to the public for the first time. “This is one of the first I’ve seen recently that doesn’t make money and doesn’t have a clear path to break even.”
VeriChip is primarily marketing the chip as the most secure and reliable way to link people with their medical records because it cannot be lost and can identify patients even when they are not conscious or lucid.
The company, which has not yet reported fourth-quarter data, lost $3.45 million on sales of $20.34 million in the first nine months of 2006. The revenue came primarily from businesses that make external radio tags for keeping track of babies in hospitals and elderly patients in nursing homes  —  businesses with plenty of competition.
By contrast, the implanted chips have gained almost no traction in the marketplace since the Food and Drug Administration approved their sale in 2004.
Applied Digital plans to issue at least 4.3 million shares of VeriChip for $6.50 to $8.50 a share, leaving it with 47.4 percent to 53.6 percent of the stock, depending on whether the three underwriters exercise their rights to buy additional shares, according to its registration statement. VeriChip would net $27 million if the shares sold at $7.50, the filing said.
Its technology requires the injection of a rice-grain size capsule into a user’s upper right arm. The chip inside contains a coded identifying number that is linked to whatever the user authorizes —  whether his or her name, address, emergency contacts and important medical records. The chip can be energized and then scanned by a hand-held reader that has to be positioned within inches of the arm to work reliably.
For the most part, the company has been giving hospitals and doctors the gear needed to read the chips and link the encoded numbers in them to patient information. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, VeriChip said that total revenue from the device and the services tied to it was less than $100,000.
VeriChip said that more than  1,200 doctors had registered to take part in  VeriMed, as the company calls the medical application of its implant, as of the end of 2006, and that close to 400 medical facilities had been equipped with scanners and supporting gear. It said that only 222 patients have had the device  implanted.
The company acknowledges  that it relies mostly on patients to provide the information linked to their identification numbers and  that health care workers may not be fully confident about its reliability until doctors or members of their staffs supervise the data entry, one of many essential steps that may  not occur. No insurers reimburse doctors for participating.
Scott R. Silverman, the chairman of Applied Digital and, since December, chairman and chief executive of VeriChip, has no shortage of vision of how the chips may eventually be embraced. He has referred to them as the “natural successor to the dog tag” for the armed forces and recently proposed that all immigrants and guest workers have the implants. But VeriChip also says that it intends to build the market with voluntary programs like VeriMed, a gesture to privacy concerns that has done little to mollify critics.
Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: “This technology sends the Orwell meter into the red zone.  There’s almost no scenario under which the benefit can’t be obtained from an anklet or a bracelet. The only reason to implant it is so that it can’t be removed voluntarily, which makes it a human rights issue.”
Applied Digital may be running out of time to overcome the  critics and doubters. It has been keeping the VeriChip business alive with a steady stream of loans and a favorable supply contract with the Digital Angel Corporation, a publicly traded subsidiary that sells similar implantable devices for identifying and tracking pets and livestock. How long Applied Digital’s creditors and long-suffering shareholders would support this largess is unclear.
In its filing, VeriChip said that $7 million would go toward repaying money lent by Applied Digital and that $8 million to $10 million would be invested in developing VeriChip over the next two years.

In the report, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said the administration had a jumble of studies and vague policy statements but no overall strategy to ensure that privacy protections would be built into computer networks linking insurers, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.
President Bush has repeatedly called for the creation of such networks, through which health care providers could share information on patients. In 2004, Mr. Bush declared that every American should have a “personal electronic medical record” within 10 years — by 2014. With computerized records, he said, “we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs and improve care.”
In response to the president’s plea, federal officials have developed elaborate plans for what they describe as “a nationwide health information network.” Mr. Bush has said: “One of the things I’ve insisted upon is that it’s got to be secure and private. There’s nothing more private than your own health records.”
But in the report, issued this month, the G.A.O. said the administration had taken only rudimentary steps to safeguard sensitive personal data that would be exchanged over the network.
Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii, who requested the investigation, said it showed that “the Bush administration is not doing enough to protect the privacy of confidential health information.” As a result, Mr. Akaka said, “more and more companies, health care providers and carriers are moving forward with health information technology without the necessary protections.”
In written comments on the report, Jim Nicholson, the secretary of veterans affairs, who supervises one of the nation’s largest health care systems, said, “I concur with the G.A.O. findings.”
But Dr. Robert M. Kolodner, who coordinates work on information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services, disputed the findings. Dr. Kolodner said his department was “very committed to privacy and security as it works toward the president’s goal” of switching medical records from paper to electronic files.
Mark A. Rothstein, the chairman of a panel that advises the government on health information policy, essentially agreed with the accountability office. “Health privacy has not received adequate attention at the Department of Health and Human Services,” said Mr. Rothstein, a professor of law and medical ethics at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. “A sense of urgency is lacking.”
Mr. Rothstein said “time is of the essence” because “the private sector is racing ahead” to establish medical record banks and health information exchanges. In December, he noted, Wal-Mart, Intel and other companies announced they were creating a huge database that could store the personal health records of more than 2.5 million employees and retirees. The companies promised they would have “stringent privacy policies and procedures.”
Mr. Rothstein said Congress should not provide more money for a nationwide health information network unless the administration did more to protect the privacy of electronic medical records.
Dr. William A. Yasnoff, a physician and computer scientist who worked at the Department of Health and Human Services from 2002 to 2005, said he too had found that “the department does not have a comprehensive approach to privacy.”
Explaining why he saw a need for stronger privacy protections in the digital age, Dr. Yasnoff said: “Anything you do to make information more accessible for good, laudable purposes will simultaneously make it more accessible for evil, nefarious purposes. People intuitively understand that, and they are worried.”
The accountability office said doubts about privacy could slow the adoption and use of electronic medical records. Professor Rothstein offered a similar prediction, saying: “If privacy protections are not built into the network, people will not trust it. They won’t participate, or they will opt out if they are allowed to.”
Legislation to encourage the use of health information technology has broad bipartisan support but died in Congress last year, partly because of disagreements over privacy protections.
Under Mr. Bush’s proposal, lawmakers said, it is not clear how much control people would have over their electronic medical records.
Several members of Congress have drafted legislation to clarify consumers’ control over such data. One proposal, by Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, both Republicans, would establish health data banks in which people could store electronic copies of their medical records. Under the bill, a consumer would “maintain ownership over the entire health record” and could control access to it.
By contrast, under existing federal rules, hospitals and other health care providers generally do not have to obtain a patient’s consent to use or disclose information for “treatment, payment or health care operations.”

The information was on an unencrypted disc that a subcontractor   recently sent  to  Magellan Behavioral Services, a company in Avon, Conn., that specializes in monitoring and coordinating mental health and substance abuse treatments for insurance companies.
Empire began notifying the affected consumers by mail on Saturday that their records — including their names, Social Security numbers, health plan identification numbers  and description of medical services back to 2003 — had been lost.
The company says it will provide 12 months of free credit monitoring by Equifax Credit Watch for any of those health plan members who fear that they may fall victim to identity theft.
Before shipping the information to Magellan, the coding and passwords that protect the privacy of the information was removed by a Magellan subcontractor,  Lisa Ann Greiner, an Empire spokeswoman, said yesterday.
Janlori Goldman, the director of the Health Privacy Center, a nonprofit organization in Washington, said the error  was “an egregious breach of privacy.” She said that insurance companies were responsible under a federal privacy law for ensuring that their contractors use adequate security procedures.
Ms. Greiner said that  the subcontractor, Health Data Management Services,  worked for  Magellan, not Empire. “If any contract was breached, we are going to take direct action,” she said.
She said that it was not yet known whether the disc had been lost or stolen.   “We are still working with the venders and U.P.S. to find the compact disc,” Ms. Greiner said. “We have no evidence that it was stolen or that members security has been breached.”
The loss, which was first reported to WellPoint’s Empire unit on Feb. 9, was the second breach of security involving WellPoint member information in recent  months.
In October, WellPoint learned that electronic backup tapes with information on 196,000 WellPoint members had been stolen from a data processor in Massachusetts operated by Concentra, a national data warehouse company.
Most of the 196,000 people in that case were Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield members in Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Virginia, according to  WellPoint.  Ms. Greiner said that data on Empire members had not been involved in the October theft, which has not been solved.
After a preliminary investigation to identify the members, Empire began notifying their New York employers last Saturday. Some companies relayed the information to all their employees, because they are not supposed to know who among their workers  may be monitored by the behavioral services company.
Empire said that the members who had data on the disc should have  received letters by the end of this week. The letters will include information on how to contact Equifax.  (Empire members who want to know sooner whether their data was lost can call toll free 1-800-293-3443,  between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.)
Magellan, for its part, said it was changing its procedures to eliminate sending information on compact discs by U.P.S., said Erin Somers, a Magellan spokeswoman.  The data loss was “the result of an error in judgment on both sides, by Magellan and Health Data Management Solutions,” she said.
“As part of our process of ensuring this does not happen again,” Ms. Somers said, the companies have adopted “a procedure to transmit this information electronically through a secure network, eliminating the CD and using a delivery service.”

5,937,2007-03-30T00:00:00Z,article,Disuse of System Is Cited in Gaps in Soldiersâ€™ Care,5490b01c38f0d847ca7e2442,"organizations:Defense Department, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Bureaucratic Red Tape, subject:Military Personnel",National,0.0,None,Medical mistakes and delays in care have been caused by some hospitalsâ€™ reluctance to use a digital record system.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/washington/30medical.html,1436,Medical mistakes and delays in care have been caused by some hospitals’ reluctance to use a digital record system.,"WASHINGTON, March 29 — Lapses in using a digital medical record system for tracking wounded soldiers have led to medical mistakes and delays in care, and have kept thousands of injured troops from getting benefits, according to former defense and military medical officials.
The Defense Department’s inability to get all hospitals to use the system has routinely forced thousands of wounded soldiers to endure long waits for treatment, the officials said, and exposed others to needless testing.
Several department officials said the problem may have played a role in the suicide of a soldier last year after he was taken to Fort Lewis in Washington State from Iraq. His intentions to kill himself were clearly documented in his digital medical record from overseas, but doctors at Fort Lewis did not consult the file and released him, according to department records and defense officials.
“The D.O.D.’s failure to share data and track patient records is truly a matter of life and death,” Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said in a statement. “This isn’t an isolated case, but a system-wide failure.”
The system was designed to make seamless the transition of soldiers who were wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan as they moved  to hospitals stateside. But only 13 of 70 military treatment centers in the United States use it even though it was mandated by the Pentagon more than two years ago, according to agency documents.
As a result, military doctors say they are less able to learn from mistakes since they cannot track the progress of wounded soldiers from one location to another. Others complain of costly and redundant testing.
“Patients are being unnecessarily exposed to radiation,” said Lt. Col. Gina Dorlac, medical director of the intensive care unit at a hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, where most severely wounded soldiers are taken from Iraq.
She said doctors from Walter Reed Army Medical Center and elsewhere regularly ordered CAT scans and M.R.I.’s even though the same tests had already been performed and the results were in the tracking system. “It’s a waste of time and money,” Colonel Dorlac said.
X-rays and CAT scans are generally considered safe, but doctors are wary of unnecessary tests because radiation can be harmful if it accumulates in a patient over time.
M.R.I.’s do not produce radiation.
Colonel Dorlac said that most doctors who used the system agreed that it worked well. But she said  many doctors at United States military hospitals seemed reluctant to use it because doctors did not know they had access or were unwilling to learn how to use it.
Until he left the Defense Department in August, Tony DeNicola was responsible for ensuring that the digital system, known as the Joint Patient Tracking Application, was used throughout the military. In an interview, Mr. DeNicola said he ran into resistance: “We couldn’t get the services to use the system because they wanted to use their own. We also never got enough cooperation from the office in charge of electronic patient records.”
The application was developed in 2004 to allow doctors and military officials to track the medical care given to troops from the moment they arrive at field hospitals in Iraq or Afghanistan through their stay in military hospitals stateside.
The Internet-based system allows doctors or other personnel to enter or view clinical data and upload images from certain types of tests. Defense Department officials said the system was just one of several sources of information used in providing care for soldiers.
Tommy J. Morris, director of deployment health technologies and support programs, also said that the record system was being integrated into a larger defense system, which would particularly help in tracking patients moving into the Department of Veterans Affairs system.
Frustrations with the Pentagon’s tracking of medical data come at a time of growing concern on Capitol Hill about medical treatment and benefits for soldiers coming home wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan.
On Tuesday, defense officials testified before Congress that their department was improving data tracking and increasingly sharing medical information with Veterans Affairs. But Senator Murray raised concerns that the Joint Patient Tracking Application was not being used.
The Defense Department blocked Veterans Affairs access to the system entirely in January and as of this week only 12 of the 40 authorized V.A. officials and doctors had had their access restored, according to Defense Department records.
Representative Steve Buyer, Republican of Indiana, said he sought a meeting with Defense Department officials after visiting a V.A. hospital in Minneapolis where doctors lacked direct access to the patient tracking system and were still receiving faxed medical records from military hospitals.
He said he left that closed-door session on Wednesday after an hour and a half of discussion “not knowing the answer” to when the problems with data tracking would be resolved.
For wounded troops, the difficulties have complicated an already frustrating experience, according to veterans advocates and defense officials. At military hospitals that still depend on paper records, wounded soldiers endure long waits for appointments because their records cannot be found or were never transferred, advocates say. Soldiers also face delays in getting rehabilitation because defense officials do not use the system to assign specialists to centers with the biggest backlogs.
According to a congressional aide  who attended the meeting on Wednesday, Defense Department officials said they were not familiar with the details of the Fort Lewis suicide.
According to other defense officials and department records, that soldier was evacuated from his unit in Mosul, Iraq, on Aug. 18, 2006, after telling doctors he had thoughts of suicide. After being evacuated to a military hospital in Germany, the soldier received psychological treatment and his condition was noted in the digital records system. On Aug. 24, he was sent to Madigan Hospital at Fort Lewis but was not admitted.
On Sept. 7, he killed himself. Defense records indicated that doctors at Fort Lewis did not check the soldier’s file in the digital system, where his suicidal tendencies were described, until a day after his death.
Sharon Ayala, spokeswoman for Madigan Hospital, said the hospital would not comment on the case because of privacy issues.
“Please be assured that the Army takes suicide and the risk of suicide very seriously,” Ms. Ayala said, adding that all troops returning from Iraq and requiring mental health evaluations are seen and evaluated by mental-health providers the day they arrive.
Soldiers may also not be receiving certain benefits, such as $430 a month for combat-related injury rehabilitation pay, because the office that provides those checks depends on data from the digital system to determine which soldiers qualify, according to Mr. DeNicola, the official who used to oversee the system.
Lt. Col. Mike Place, a physician at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital at Fort Campbell, Ky., said it was important for stateside doctors to use and update the digital records because doctors in Iraq and Afghanistan often access the files to check up on soldiers they cared for and to learn from the results.
Colonel Place said, for example, that many soldiers with blast wounds in Iraq experienced certain complications after returning to the United States, like muscle swelling that causes severe nerve damage. If battlefield doctors knew that, they could change how they treat soldiers immediately after they are wounded.
With the Joint Patient Tracking Application, Colonel Place said: “We don’t have to wait until the surgeon comes home to tell them. They can see the trend right away and start making changes.”
Steve Robinson, a veterans’ advocate, said  virtually all military doctors agreed that the digital system was effective in tracking patients. But he added that he had participated in seven Congressional hearings, most recently last week, that focused on problems with how the defense and veterans departments track medical information.
“We don’t really have time to wait for another system to come online when we have one ready now that the D.O.D. approved,” Mr. Robinson said. “The tools are there, but we just keep having meetings about whether to use them.”
Defense Department officials say they need more time — and an additional $30 million in the next fiscal year — to integrate the joint patient tracking system with the department’s larger system, an effort that has already cost more than $200 million. The Joint Patient Tracking Application cost an estimated $320,000 to develop and about $2 million a year to operate, according  to  Defense Department documents.
But last September the department certified that the tracking application had adequate security and privacy protections, according to documents from the office of the deputy assistant secretary of defense for force health protection and readiness.

But with their medical costs ballooning, top executives of large companies are starting to speak up again — and many are calling for a national approach to fixing health care. Few advocate a wholesale shift to government-directed medicine, but most are seeking broad changes in the employer-subsidized health system, which they regard as unsustainable in its current form.
Business executives are motivated in large part by health insurance premiums that are rising much faster than inflation, adding to their costs at a time when many are facing more intense competition from abroad, where companies rely on government-supported health care systems largely financed by taxes. A 2006 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates found that premiums in the United States had risen about 87 percent since 2000.
“Five years from now this problem will have to be cured, or the competitiveness of the United States will be dramatically affected,” said J. Randall MacDonald, senior vice president for human resources at I.B.M.
But companies are by no means speaking with one voice. Everybody’s problem — the growing cost of health coverage  — can be felt differently depending on the size of a company and whether it has promised health benefits to retirees.
Older companies, for example, are more likely to welcome government help on coverage for workers who leave before they are eligible for Medicare and may find they cannot afford insurance. But Silicon Valley technology companies that do not have or need retiree coverage are wary of new taxpayer-financed subsidies.
The health care debate is heating up as candidates polish their positions for next year’s presidential primaries, and as Democrats in Congress assert their newfound power.
In general, employers “are more interested in reform today than at any time since the Clinton effort” in the early 1990s, said Robert S. Galvin, global health care and policy director at General Electric, which provides health benefits for 460,000 employees and dependents and 240,000 retirees and dependents.
The surge of interest, Mr.  Galvin said, “is driven by compounding health cost increases at three times the general inflation rate, plus the entrance of Wal-Mart and other retailers” that are beginning to feel the pain of out-of-control increases in costs.
Wal-Mart Stores introduced lower-cost coverage for its huge work force last year, after state officials and editorial writers criticized the numbers of Wal-Mart employees on state Medicaid rolls.
Many retailers, with large staffs of low-paid, temporary and part-time workers, would welcome a larger government role.
“The way it’s going, there will be 75 million uninsured in another 10 years,” said James D. Sinegal, chief executive of Costco Wholesale, which subsidizes health care for 81,000 of its 100,000 workers in the United States. “The federal government has to lend some assistance.”
Mr. Sinegal said he had agreed to support an unlikely coalition of businesses and labor unions that recently called  for “achieving a new American health care system by 2012.”  The group, the Better Health Care Together campaign, includes Wal-Mart, AT&T, Intel and Kelly Services, the temporary-staffing company, as well as the Service Employees International Union and the Communications Workers of America.
“The system is going to break,” warned Carl T. Camden, president and chief executive of Kelly Services. “You can only put so many uninsured people through the emergency rooms before employers stop offering coverage.”
Indeed, a bill proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would scale back the role of employers while requiring individuals and companies to share in the costs. President Bush’s proposal would treat high-cost health care plans paid by employers as wages subject to income tax, and would also offer a new tax deduction to people who buy insurance on their own.
Economists say that employers would raise wages if they did not have to pay for employee health care. The Treasury would stand to gain $140 billion a year in personal income taxes if the benefits were treated as wages, said Len Burman, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. There would be about $70 billion more in additional payroll taxes due on those wages, he said.
But taxes would have to go up to keep the health care system functioning.
Leslie Dach, executive vice president for corporate affairs and government relations at Wal-Mart, said that the company’s “message to elected officials is: ‘The time to act is now.’ ” Mr. Dach, a public relations specialist based in Washington and a frequent adviser to Democratic presidential candidates, joined Wal-Mart last year.
While employers generally agree that steps must be taken to control health care costs, they are divided over whether or not the solutions should come from the government.
“That is the elephant in the room,” said Mr. Galvin of General Electric.
Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of Intel, another participant in the Better Health Care Together campaign, is skeptical about a new government role. He said the private sector could do the best job at improving efficiency in the system.
Corporate purchasers could use their buying power, he said, to insist on technological aids like electronic prescriptions, remote monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses and electronic  health records for Americans.
Companies like General Motors argue that government agencies, which spend about half of the $2 trillion in annual health spending, should join with employers in pushing for changes to lower costs.
“Working with the government as a fellow purchaser can accomplish a great deal to help improve our health care system,” said Bruce E.  Bradley, director of health care strategy and public policy at G.M., which provides health care for 1.1 million people, including more than 500,000 retirees and their spouses.
Michael J. Critelli, chairman of Pitney Bowes, the business services company, says he backs changes that emphasize preventive medicine. “Any health plan, whether employer, government or private insurance needs to invest its most significant dollars in incentives for people to take good care of themselves,” he said.
He added: “The spiraling cost of health care is a result of an explosive growth in chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and asthma. The health care debate needs to be focused on the core issue: making Americans healthier.”
By providing clinics, exercise and other wellness programs as well as  low-cost or free drugs for certain types of patients, he said, annual cost increases for Pitney Bowes employees have fallen into the low single digits over the last 15 years. That is well below the double-digit percentage increases that many companies have experienced.
Neither G.M. nor Wal-Mart favors a government-based central payer system. But older companies and their unions are very interested in Congressional measures that would allow early retirees under age 65 to qualify for Medicare or to buy into the Medicare program, with help from their former employers, said Alan Reuther, legislative director of the United Automobile Workers.
General Motors has far different concerns, of course, than Wal-Mart, a retailer that covers  more than one million employees and dependents in the United States but does not provide a retiree health benefit.
Another set of issues divides large companies from small businesses, which employ 50 percent of working Americans. Their owners worry that in some states they may be forced to spend for coverage of young workers with little interest in health coverage.
“The premium keeps going up and, even worse, the insurance companies keep decreasing the benefits,” said Steve Caughran, who owns three small companies in Fresno, Calif. One, a Quiznos fast-food restaurant, has 14 uninsured high school and college students who work part time.
Requiring employers to cover workers who lack health insurance will hardly correct the forces  pushing up costs, like expensive new drugs, insurance fraud and inefficient state programs, Mr. Caughran argues.
Mr. Camden of Kelly Services notes  that the majority of the 45 million Americans who do not have health insurance have jobs. He argues that many of these workers are essential to keeping the United States economy competitive.
“In the next decade or two, manufacturing is going to steadily decline,” he said. “Employment will come from the entrepreneurial, scientific parts of the economy,” including many who work as independent contractors and temporary employees.
Part of the solution should be to “separate health care from employer sponsorship,” Mr. Camden said. “The employer-provided health care system is just dead, although some people haven’t recognized it as dead yet.”
Similarly, Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, criticizes the current employer-sponsored system as “a relic of the industrial economy.”
Mr. Camden listed possible remedies as an “employment-based” withholding tax, matched by employers as in Social Security, with Medicare and Medicaid expanded to cover the unemployed.
But most big companies are not ready to give up on their health care obligations. “Regardless of who takes the lead, we collectively as a national society have to consolidate around three or four different ideas,” Mr. MacDonald of I.B.M. said.
He called for a national debate on such topics as maintaining existing employer-subsidized health care, with “some level of umbrella coverage over that, some level of a single payer system.”
“A lot of positioning is going on now,” he said. “The reality is that changes are inevitable, I think sooner rather than later.”

That is what a hospital group in central Pennsylvania is trying to learn in an experiment that some experts say is a radically new way to encourage hospitals and doctors to provide  high-quality care that can avoid costly mistakes.
The group, Geisinger Health System, has overhauled its approach to surgery. And taking a cue from the makers of television sets, washing machines and consumer products,  Geisinger essentially guarantees its workmanship, charging a flat fee that includes 90 days of follow-up treatment.
Even if a patient suffers complications or has to come back to the hospital, Geisinger promises not to send the insurer another bill.
Geisinger is by no means the only hospital system currently rethinking ways to better deliver care that might also reduce costs. But Geisinger’s effort is noteworthy as a distinct departure from the typical medical reimbursement system in this country, under which doctors and hospitals are paid mainly for delivering more care — not necessarily better care.
Since Geisinger began its experiment in February 2006,  focusing on elective heart bypass surgery, it says patients have been less likely to return to intensive care, have spent fewer days in the hospital and are more likely to return directly to their own homes instead of a nursing home.
Geisinger presented the first-year results of its experimental program at a meeting last month of the American Surgical Association.
Geisinger stands out as a  group that has transformed the way it delivers care, said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, the chief executive of Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a national nonprofit organization whose goal is better patient care.
In almost no other field would consumers tolerate the frequency of error that is common in medicine, Dr. Berwick said,  and Geisinger has managed to reduce the rate significantly.   “Getting everything right is really, really hard,” he said.
It is still too early to know whether the approach, which Geisinger calls ProvenCare, will catch on with employers and health insurers.
So far, the only insurer that Geisinger has contracted with under the new arrangement is its own insurance unit, which covers about 210,000 people in Pennsylvania. Eventually, though, Geisinger hopes to attract other insurers and employers that provide health benefits by expanding the approach into other lines of care provided by the nearly 660 doctors it employs at its three hospitals  and 55 offices   in the region.
Geisinger is trying to address what it views as a fundamental flaw in the typical medical reimbursement system.
Under the typical system, missing an antibiotic or  giving poor instructions when a patient is released from the hospital results in a perverse reward: the chance to bill the patient again if more treatment is  necessary. As a result, doctors and hospitals have little incentive to  ensure they consistently provide the treatments that medical research has shown to produce the best results.
Researchers estimate that roughly half of American patients never get the most basic recommended treatments — like an aspirin after a heart attack, for example, or antibiotics before hip surgery.
The wide variation in treatments can translate to big differences in death rates and surgical complications. In Pennsylvania alone, the mortality rate during a hospital stay for heart surgery varies  from zero  in the best-performing hospitals to nearly 10 percent at the worst performer, according to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, a state agency.
Around the world, other modern industries — whether car manufacturing or computer chip making — have long understood the importance of improving each piece of the production process to tamp down costs and improve overall quality.
But hospitals have been slow to focus their attention on standardizing the way they deliver care, said Dr. Arnold Milstein, the medical director for the Pacific Business Group on Health, a California organization of large companies that provide medical benefits to their workers.  Geisinger  “is one of the few systems in the country that is just beginning to understand the lessons of global manufacturing,” Dr. Milstein said.
In reassessing how they perform bypass surgery, Geisinger doctors identified 40 essential steps. Then they devised procedures to ensure the steps would always be followed, regardless of which surgeon or which one of its three hospitals was involved.
From screening a patient for the risk of a stroke before surgery, to making sure the patient has started on a daily aspirin regimen upon discharge,  Geisinger’s 40-step system makes sure every patient gets the recommended  treatment.
At least one heart surgery patient, David Dunsmuir, 65, was impressed by the care he received — and the doctors’ and staff’s efforts to explain things during the four days he spent last December at Geisinger’s hospital in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
The care, which included a few weeks of rehabilitation,  was delivered “like clockwork,” Mr. Dunsmuir said recently. “I’m feeling fine.”
For Geisinger, as with any hospital, the challenge is often in persuading the doctors to get on board.  Before ProvenCare began,  Geisinger’s seven cardiac surgeons each delivered the care they believed was best for patients. And that care varied.
“We realized there were seven ways to do something,” said Dr. Alfred S. Casale, the director of cardiothoracic surgery at Geisinger.
Reviewing the existing professional guidelines and medical literature, Geisinger’s cardiac surgeons came up with their list of 40 action items viewed as best practices — including giving a patient antibiotics within a specified time before surgery, and then giving beta blocker drugs afterward to reduce the chances of an irregular heartbeat.
The doctors nevertheless needed some persuading  that ProvenCare would not be some form of inferior cookbook medicine, said Dr. Charles H. Benoit, a cardiac surgeon. “It’s not that we were a uniquely compliant group of personalities,” he said.
Doctors can choose not to follow a particular measure, based on the needs of an individual patient. But they rarely do so. And they also know that any of the steps can be altered if new medical evidence emerges.
When the system began, Geisinger was performing all 40 steps for bypass surgery only 59 percent of the time. Now, an operation is canceled if any of the pre-operative measures have been forgotten. For the last seven months, Geisinger says, its teams have managed to have a perfect record in following all recommended steps for surgery and follow-up care.
“It really has made a change in the way we think about things,” Dr. Benoit said.
The challenge now is to develop  the same exacting standards for other kinds of care, like hip replacements, where there is much less medical agreement about what constitutes best practice, Dr. Glenn D. Steele Jr., Geisinger’s chief executive, said in an interview at the system’s headquarters in Danville, Pa.
“I think it’s doable,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be easy.”
Even more important, Geisinger must now see if its ProvenCare program has what Dr. Steele refers to as “market legs” — whether it is appealing enough that insurers and employers will be willing to buy it. Heart surgery and follow-up care, which runs about $30,000, are among the biggest-ticket medical offerings that Geisinger provides. But  Geisinger executives say outside insurers and employers have indicated that Geisinger would  need to include from 5 to 10 other procedures under  its plan before they would  have enough of their employees affected  to make it worth their while to sign up.
Under  the experiment,  the hospital charges a flat fee for the surgery, plus half the amount it has calculated as the historical cost of related care for the next 90 days. So instead of billing for any additional hospital stays — which typically run $12,000 to $15,000 — Geisinger absorbs that extra cost.
Some employers seem intrigued by the idea of some sort of financial guarantee that encourages hospitals and doctors to do the job right the first time, according to Joseph Makarewicz, the chief operating officer at Offset Paperback Manufacturers, a printer in Dallas, Pa. Offset offers its 800 employees a choice of health plans, including Geisinger’s.
Mr. Makarewicz predicts that similar initiatives by other health care providers  will take off. “Employers like us will encourage it,” he said.
Because the flat-fee plan means Geisinger will forgo some additional revenue from fixing mistakes, better care could potentially mean less money, especially if it means emptier hospital beds. But Dr. Steele says there is more than enough demand for Geisinger’s services.
Promising  as the experiment may be, the model may not be easy to adopt in other places.
Geisinger does not have the name recognition of a Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic, but it is among the country’s most sophisticated health systems. It has employed electronic health records for more than a decade, for example, which means Geisinger can closely track the care it provides and the results achieved — in detailed ways that are nearly impossible for the many hospital systems that do not have its degree of digital coordination.
Another Geisinger edge is that it directly employs the bulk of the doctors who practice at its hospitals.  That is in contrast to most hospital systems, even the country’s biggest and best, where doctors typically act as independent contractors — making it harder for a hospital to coax them toward a uniform set of procedures,  and often leaving it unclear who is responsible for follow-up care.
“The degree of fragmentation of care also limits how generalizable this model is,” said Dr. Hoangmai H. Pham, a senior researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit group in Washington.
Even Geisinger’s chief executive, Dr. Steele, acknowledges that the effort could prove overly ambitious. “I’m not betting the whole business on it,” he said. He has also pushed Geisinger further into other areas like clinical research and disease-management programs.
But he also says there is an enormous value in simply showing that a hospital system as large as his can successfully standardize care, demonstrating  “the benefit to patients and the benefit to buyers” — all backed by a 90-day warranty.

Brailer, a former senior health official in the Bush administration, is starting a $700 million private equity fund, Health Evolution Partners.","Venture investment in the health business typically chases miracle cures and high-technology gadgets, like bioengineered drugs and new medical devices. They promise much but  cost a lot.
Dr. David J. Brailer, a former senior health official in the Bush administration, is starting a $700 million private equity fund, Health Evolution Partners, with a  different mission. “We’re going to be investing in things that can reduce the crushing costs of health care,” said Dr. Brailer, who was the administration’s national coordinator of health information technology.
At the outset, the sole investor will be Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the United States with assets of $240 billion. Calpers funds form the basis for pension and health benefits for 1.5 million workers, retirees and their families.
So as Dr. Brailer’s equity fund pursues investments in cost-effective, high-quality health care, the impact on Calpers could extend beyond its balance sheet.
“Those businesses could meaningfully affect how you care for the insured,” said  Fred Cohen, a doctor and a partner at the Texas Pacific Group, a large private equity group. “Calpers and David Brailer have done a lot of thinking about how one does good and how one does well.”
Calpers, Dr. Cohen added, is “big enough to be able to use its financial resources to do clever things to try to change the health system.”
Health Evolution Partners, Dr. Brailer said, would look to invest in companies with new ideas in fields like remote monitoring of patients, the management of chronic diseases, telemedicine, predictive genomics to tailor drug doses and eBay-style Internet marketplaces for services like reading chest X-rays.
During his two years in the administration, which ended in May 2006, Dr. Brailer championed the adoption of electronic patient records to improve the quality of care and cut costs. But his investment firm, he said, has no plans to invest in electronic health records, which he termed a “saturated market.”
Today, Dr. Brailer said, the opportunity lies in linking health information technology to services. As an example, he mentioned the possibility of putting inexpensive remote sensors in the home of a person with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease, so a doctor or nurse could monitor the patient’s condition and activities. The patient, Dr. Brailer explained, could live more independently for a time and delay going into a nursing home, which can cost several thousand dollars a month.
Dr. Brailer said that he would not rule out an investment in a company offering technology or service to a hospital. “But mostly, we’re going to invest in things that keep people out of institutions,” he said.
The challenge to that investment strategy is that payment in America’s health care system is typically on a fee-for-service basis. So doctors, hospitals, clinics and drug companies are paid more for doing more — more tests, more surgeries, more pills.
Medical experts and economists have routinely criticized fee-for-service incentives for encouraging an unnecessary run-up in costs that can produce worse health outcomes. Dr. Brailer, who is both a medical doctor and an economist, calls it “high-volume, procedure-churn med- icine.”
He says that the system and its incentives are beginning to change, as insurers become convinced that preventive medicine, disease management and other long-term cost-cutting steps are both cost-effective and better medicine.
Health Evolution Partners, Dr. Brailer said, is the start of a 10-year strategy that assumes such approaches will increasingly move into the mainstream of health care.
Calpers will be the only investor for a year, with $500 million earmarked for direct investments and joint venture investments, and $200 million more for investments  in other health funds.
After a year, the fund will be open to other investors. “We want to create an ecosystem to help change health care,” Dr. Brailer said.

Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania is learning that to contain costs is to pluck dollars from someone’s pocket.,"HARRISBURG, Pa. — Gov. Edward G. Rendell, an unapologetic big-city liberal who campaigned as a health care reformer, might have been expected to propose a plan to cover the 900,000 Pennsylvanians who are uninsured.
And he did so, after winning reelection last year in a landslide. But like other governors in the vanguard of health policy, Mr. Rendell also concluded that such a move would be unaffordable, and perhaps politically unattainable, without serious efforts to control costs.
As a result, Mr. Rendell’s “Prescription for Pennsylvania” included a ban on smoking in public places, a reduction in the rate of hospitalization for chronic diseases and an expansion of the role nurses play in treating patients. He even framed his proposal to provide universal access as “a form of cost containment,” emphasizing that 6.5 percent of every health-insurance premium in Pennsylvania went to subsidizing care for the uninsured, often in emergency rooms.
Mr. Rendell is learning, however, that to contain costs is eventually to pluck dollars from someone’s pocket. His plan has incited protest from hospitals, doctors, insurers and small businesses, each of them finding something  to detest.
[A contentious legislative budget session  has led to a stalemate that put the fiscal plan 10 days overdue as of yesterday after the state furloughed some 25,000 workers and suspended many services. But lawmakers said the impasse was broken late last night.]
Mr. Rendell seems to be facing an uphill task. Once confident that his package would win quick approval, he now puts the odds of success at 50-50.  Mr. Rendell says he is calling for shared sacrifice. “Everyone’s ox gets gored a little bit in this,” he said in an interview here. “If we’re ever going to have accessible health insurance for all Americans, we have to begin by containing costs. If costs continue to spiral out of control, there is no way the government can afford to pay for it.”
Other big-state governors who are leading a second wave of health care overhaul — after recent expansions of coverage in Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont — are also making strong comments about runaway costs, as are presidential candidates in both parties.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, has emphasized in recent speeches that his plan to make insurance mandatory must be accompanied by stringent reductions in health care spending.
Like Mr. Rendell’s plan, the Schwarzenegger one has run into opposition from doctors, hospitals and businesses that are upset about his proposals to tax their revenues.
In Illinois, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democrat, is selling his health care plan by forecasting that the savings generated by better management of chronic diseases and expanded use of electronic records will exceed the cost of extending coverage to 1.4 million adults. Mr. Blagojevich is trying to revive his plan after legislators rejected a proposal to pay for extended coverage with a tax on gross business receipts.
“The key is, Can you package the reforms to show what impact it’s going to have on people with insurance so that you can motivate labor and big business?” said Kenneth E. Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory University who is advising Mr. Blagojevich. “In Illinois, we showed that every $1 in state spending would yield $2 in savings for people with private health insurance. That refocuses the debate.”
In Pennsylvania, Mr. Rendell makes his case by explaining that insurance premiums increased by 76 percent from 2000 to 2006, six times the rise in median wages. A major cause, he argues, is the more than $6 billion in unnecessary annual costs for the treatment of infections, injuries caused by medical errors and controllable chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.
Last year, Pennsylvania reported 19,154 cases of hospital-acquired infections in 2005, generating nearly 400,000 additional patient days in the hospital and $3.5 billion in charges. The state recently detailed 175 hospital medical errors over a 30-month period, many of them classified as “wrong-site surgeries.”
Mr. Rendell’s plan would require hospitals to adopt hygiene practices that have reduced infection rates at several Pittsburgh hospitals, some as simple as more hand-washing. To manage chronic diseases more efficiently in a state with a large elderly population, the plan would give incentives to providers who encourage healthier lifestyles and closer attention to medications.
Mr. Rendell said he did not propose making insurance mandatory, as is the case in Massachusetts and in Mr. Schwarzenegger’s plan, because he wanted first to drive down the cost of care. He said he had reasoned that unlike limiting reform to coverage of the uninsured, who make up about 7 percent of the state’s population, a focus on cost control would appeal to every Pennsylvanian who visits a doctor or pays a premium. It could also win over business interests because of the impact of health costs on corporate bottom lines.
But hospitals are lobbying against his proposals to regulate expenditures for new construction and equipment and to cut off reimbursement payments when patient stays are extended because of medical mistakes and preventable infections. Doctors do not like his proposal to give more responsibility to physicians’ assistants and nurse midwives.
Small-business owners are protesting his call for a “fair share assessment” — a 3 percent payroll tax on employers who do not offer insurance, with the proceeds dedicated to covering the uninsured. And insurers are working to defeat proposals that would prohibit consideration of preexisting medical conditions in rate-setting and require that at least 85 percent of premiums be spent on health care costs as opposed to administrative overhead.
The Senate remains in the hands of Republicans who side with hospital, insurance and business interests. In the House, Democrats are fighting to hold the single-seat majority they gained last November after 12 years in the minority. Neither chamber is in the mood to raise taxes, and Mr. Rendell’s “fair share assessment” has won little support.
The governor has linked budget negotiations to some of his proposals, and the legislature is still considering them. But his broader plan has effectively been tabled until a fall session because of business opposition to the payroll tax.
“When small businesses don’t offer coverage, it’s not because they don’t like their employees,” said Gene Barr, vice president for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. “It’s that they can’t afford it. I’ve had e-mails and phone calls from small businesses saying, ‘Look, if this goes in, I close.’ ”
In a state where 71 percent of the uninsured are employed, Mr. Rendell said it would be unfair for small businesses to not share in the pain. He said he hoped to persuade companies that provide insurance to persuade large corporations that do provide insurance to help apply pressure.
But he also said he would hold his nose and sign a bill that paid for expanded health care insurance through an alternate source if the legislature came up with one.

The findings raise further questions about possible links between  antidepressant drugs and suicide.
In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration, faced with evidence from controlled studies, mandated a “black box” notification on all antidepressant drugs, warning that their use in children and adolescents could increase the risk of suicide. In May, after reviewing controlled data from all age groups, the F.D.A. required an updated version to include a warning about suicide risk in young adults 18 to 24.
The studies the F.D.A. analyzed, in which patients were followed closely and matched to controls, are considered the most direct way to analyze results. The two new studies were based on retrospective reviews of medical records.
In one, researchers led by Dr. Gregory E. Simon, a psychiatrist with the Center for Health Studies in Seattle, reviewed the records of 109,356 people being treated for depression in a large prepaid health plan serving 500,000 people in Washington State and northern Idaho. They found that suicide attempts were most common in the month before treatment began, declined sharply in the month after it began, and tapered off in the following six months. All treatments —  psychotherapy, medication or both  —  showed the same pattern, suggesting that treating depression reduced suicide  risk  regardless of technique.
The authors acknowledged that they had no way to assess the severity of illness either before or after starting treatment, and that about a third of patients dropped out of treatment within a few weeks, two factors that may have influenced the results.  Dr. Simon has received research grants and consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies.
Dr. David Shaffer, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Columbia who was not involved in the study, said the results should prove reassuring to people taking antidepressants. “The study provided no evidence that starting an antidepressant increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt,” he said. “Starting treatment, regardless of which kind, seems to reduce suicide attempts.”
The second study was led by Robert D. Gibbons, director of the Center for Health Statistics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Using medical data from the Veterans Health Administration, researchers found that among 226,866 adults with depression, the overall rate of suicide attempts after beginning treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or S.S.R.I., was about one-third the rate of those who received no antidepressant at all. This was true for men 18 to 25 as well as for older adults.
“The V.A. has a very good electronic medical record system, so this is likely to be reliable data,” said Dr. Nada Stotland, a professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago. “That makes these results even more powerful.” Dr. Stotland had no part in the study.
The risk of suicide attempt was significantly higher before S.S.R.I. treatment than immediately after starting it, a finding that coincides with that of the Simon study. The scientists acknowledged that their patients were almost all men, and that they did not include any suicide attempts that did not result in contact with the Veterans Health Administration medical records system. One of the six authors has been a paid adviser to pharmaceutical companies.
The authors of both papers worried that extending the  boxed warning to young adults might discourage people from seeking effective treatment. “The F.D.A. didn’t say anything wrong in the warning,” Dr. Simon said. “I am 100 percent in support of the message that we need better follow-up care. But my concern is that the warning may scare people away from treatment.”
Dr. Gibbons expressed similar concerns. “These two studies clearly show that the greatest risk for suicide is depression,” he said. “Failure to treat depression, either using pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, will lead to dramatic increases in the rate of serious suicide attempts and completions in the U.S. and in the world.”

The experiment, which started in April 2005 and is to continue through April 2008,  is an attempt by Medicare to rethink the way it reimburses  doctors. The goal is to pay them for the quality of the care they deliver, rather than on how many tests and procedures they perform.
“We want to reward providers for the right care at the right time,” said Herb Kuhn, acting deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who said he was “very, very pleased with the first-year results.”
Although there are sharp limits to the conclusions that can be drawn, Medicare officials and the doctor groups involved say the experiment shows the potential in encouraging doctors to provide care and counseling programs that help patients stay out of the hospital or emergency room by better managing chronic conditions  like diabetes or heart disease. “It’s where the Medicare program has to go,” Mr. Kuhn said.
While all of the 10 physician groups participating in the experiment improved their care for patients during the first year, according to the measurements in place, only two earned bonus payments. Those two, the University of Michigan Faculty Practice and the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin, were paid a total bonus of $7.3 million for saving Medicare $9.5 million. The bonus was in addition to Medicare payments for their usual services.
All 10 of the participants are large sophisticated organizations, with substantial experience in electronic health records or other systems known to improve patient care. And the fact that eight of them did not meet the bonus threshold indicates how difficult it may be for Medicare to develop a payment system giving most  doctors, many in small, less modern practices, a true financial incentive to improve care.
But Medicare officials emphasized that the results represented only the first year of a three-year experiment. “It’s trending in a very positive way,” Mr. Kuhn said.
Medicare compared the hospital and doctor bills for the 224,000 patients being treated by the 10 groups with the bills from other doctors and patients in the same geographic areas to determine whether there were financial savings to the government. The doctors also had to meet certain quality criteria, like the basis of 10 clinical measures involving diabetes care.
For the second year, clinical measures for heart disease will be added. And in year three, measures for hypertension and basic preventive care for all patients will be assessed.
While Medicare said it had not yet calculated the experiment’s overall savings, the physician groups say they together saved the program about $21 million.
In subsequent years, “we expect greater savings will be generated, and the majority of practices will be receiving a bonus,” said Mark Selna, a physician with Geisinger Health Systems, a Danville, Pa., system of hospitals whose doctors are participating in the experiment.
Although Medicare and the doctors’ groups are still analyzing the information for the first year, many of the programs put in place seem to have resulted in fewer hospitalizations. Among its efforts, for example, Marshfield started a program in which eye exams for diabetes patients could be performed at a local doctors’ office rather than requiring a trip to a specialist. The clinic, which is based in Wisconsin, says it has reduced hospitalizations for its diabetes patients by about 13 percent in mid-2007 compared with 2004.
Other successful measures include simple follow-up. The University of Michigan group is having a nurse or nursing assistant call patients who have been discharged from the hospital or emergency room within 24 hours, making sure they understand the drugs they need to take or that, for example, a visiting nurse came as scheduled.
“It’s filled a huge gap in care,” said Dr. Caroline Blaum, the physician leading the effort at the university.
But even the groups able to achieve adequate savings say the complexity of the program and the time elapsed since the first-year test period ended early last year makes it difficult to respond to the potential financial incentives.  “The financial model for this program may not be viable,” said Dr. Blaum at the University of Michigan, saying the doctors there are uncertain about what exactly they had done to generate savings.
But many of the doctor groups involved spoke of making useful changes to how they cared for patients, like following up with a nurse’s call or educating a patient, even if they do not result in any additional revenue.
“There’s clearly value in these services,” said Dr. Katherine Schneider, the physician overseeing the effort at Middlesex Health System, a Middletown, Conn., hospital group that works closely with local physicians and is participating in the experiment. But, she added, “they are expensive to provide, and no one is reimbursing us.”
And questions remain about  how to motivate individual physicians because  the experiment rewards organizations,  not the individual doctor who must actually ensure that the patient gets a flu shot or goes to the right specialist.
“The real driving force of change needs to occur in a physician office,” said Dr. Karl Ulrich, the president and chief executive of the Marshfield Clinic.

That may be true at many top medical centers. But the disturbing truth is that this country lags well behind other advanced nations in delivering timely and effective care.
Michael Moore struck a nerve in his new documentary, “Sicko,” when he extolled the virtues of the government-run health care systems in France, England, Canada and even Cuba while deploring the failures of the largely private insurance system in this country. There is no question that Mr. Moore overstated his case by making foreign systems look almost flawless. But there is a growing body of evidence that, by an array of pertinent yardsticks, the United States is a laggard not a leader in providing good medical care.
Seven years ago, the World Health Organization made the first major effort to rank the health systems of 191 nations. France and Italy took the top two spots; the United States was a dismal 37th. More recently, the highly regarded Commonwealth Fund has pioneered in comparing the United States with other advanced nations through surveys of patients and doctors and analysis of other data. Its latest report, issued in May, ranked the United States last or next-to-last compared with five other nations — Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom — on most measures of performance, including quality of care and access to it. Other comparative studies also put the United States in a relatively bad light.
Insurance coverage. All other major industrialized nations provide universal health coverage,  and most of them have comprehensive benefit packages with no cost-sharing by the patients. The United States, to its shame, has some 45 million people without health insurance and many more millions who have poor coverage. Although the president has blithely said that these people can always get treatment in an emergency room, many studies have shown that people without insurance postpone treatment until a minor illness becomes worse, harming their own health and imposing greater costs.
Access. Citizens abroad often face long waits before they can get to see a specialist or undergo elective surgery. Americans typically get prompter attention, although Germany does better. The real barriers here are the costs facing low-income people without insurance or with skimpy coverage. But even Americans with above-average incomes find it more difficult than their counterparts abroad to get care on nights or weekends without going to an emergency room, and many report having to wait six days or more for an appointment with their own doctors.
Fairness. The United States ranks dead last on almost all measures of equity because we have the greatest disparity in the quality of care given to richer and poorer citizens. Americans with below-average incomes are much less likely than their counterparts in other industrialized nations to see a doctor when sick, to fill prescriptions or to get needed tests and follow-up care.
Healthy lives. We have known for years that America has a high infant mortality rate, so it is no surprise that we rank last among 23 nations by that yardstick. But the problem is much broader. We rank near the bottom in healthy life expectancy at age 60, and 15th among 19 countries in deaths from a wide range of illnesses that would not have been fatal if treated with timely and effective care. The good news is that we have done a better job than other industrialized nations in reducing smoking. The bad news is that our obesity epidemic is the worst in the world.
Quality. In a comparison with five other countries, the Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States first in providing the “right care” for a given condition as defined by standard clinical guidelines and gave it especially high marks for preventive care, like Pap smears and mammograms to detect early-stage cancers, and blood tests and cholesterol checks for hypertensive patients. But we scored poorly in coordinating the care of chronically ill patients, in protecting the safety of patients, and in meeting their needs and preferences, which drove our overall quality rating down to last place. American doctors and hospitals kill patients through surgical and medical mistakes more often than their counterparts in other industrialized nations.
Life and death. In a comparison of five countries, the United States had the best survival rate for breast cancer, second best for cervical cancer and childhood leukemia, worst for kidney transplants, and almost-worst for liver transplants and colorectal cancer. In an eight-country comparison, the United States ranked last in years of potential life lost to circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes and had the second highest death rate from bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. Although several factors can affect these results, it seems likely that the quality of care delivered was a significant contributor.
Patient satisfaction. Despite the declarations of their political leaders, many Americans hold surprisingly negative views of their health care system. Polls in Europe and North America seven to nine years ago found that only 40 percent of Americans were satisfied with the nation’s health care system, placing us 14th out of 17 countries. In recent Commonwealth Fund surveys of five countries, American attitudes stand out as the most negative, with a third of the adults surveyed calling for rebuilding the entire system, compared with only 13 percent who feel that way in Britain and 14 percent in Canada.
That may be because Americans face higher out-of-pocket costs than citizens elsewhere, are less apt to have a long-term doctor, less able to see a doctor on the same day when sick, and less apt to get their questions answered or receive clear instructions from a doctor. On the other hand, Gallup polls in recent years have shown that three-quarters of the respondents in the United States, in Canada and in Britain rate their personal care as excellent or good, so it could be hard to motivate these people for the wholesale change sought by the disaffected.
Use of information technology. Shockingly, despite our vaunted prowess in computers, software and the Internet, much of our health care system is still operating in the dark ages of paper records and handwritten scrawls. American primary care doctors lag years behind doctors in other advanced nations in adopting electronic medical records or prescribing medications electronically. This makes it harder to coordinate care, spot errors and adhere to standard clinical guidelines.
Top-of-the-line care. Despite our poor showing in many international comparisons, it is doubtful that many Americans, faced with a life-threatening illness, would rather be treated elsewhere.  We tend to think that our very best medical centers are the best in the world. But whether this is a realistic assessment or merely a cultural preference for the home team is difficult to say. Only when better measures of clinical excellence are developed will discerning medical shoppers know for sure who is the best of the best.
•
With health care emerging as a major issue in the presidential campaign and in Congress, it will be important to get beyond empty boasts that this country has “the best health care system in the world” and turn instead to fixing its very real defects. The main goal should be to reduce the huge number of uninsured, who are a major reason for our poor standing globally. But there is also plenty of room to improve our coordination of care, our use of computerized records, communications between doctors and patients, and dozens of other factors that impair the quality of care. The world’s most powerful economy should be able to provide a health care system that really is the best.

15,910,2007-08-14T00:00:00Z,article,Google and Microsoft Look to Change Health Care,5484381a38f0d80df4fa4d2f,"subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, organizations:Google Inc, organizations:Microsoft Corp",Business,0.0,None,Two candidates for Web supremacy are working up their plans to improve the nationâ€™s health care.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/technology/14healthnet.html,1459,Two candidates for Web supremacy are working up their plans to improve the nation’s health care.,"In politics, every serious candidate for the White House has a health care plan. So too in business, where the two leading candidates for Web supremacy, Google and Microsoft, are working up their plans to improve the nation’s health care.
By combining better Internet search tools, the vast resources of the Web and online personal health records, both companies are betting they can enable people to make smarter choices about their health habits and medical care.
“What’s behind this is the mass consumerization of health information,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, the former health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration, who now heads a firm that invests in health ventures.
It is too soon to know whether either Google or Microsoft will make real headway.  Health care, experts note, is a field where policy, regulation and entrenched interests tend to slow the pace of change, and technology companies have a history of losing patience.
And for most people, typing an ailment into a Web search engine is very different from entrusting a corporate titan with personal information about their health.
Google and Microsoft recognize the obstacles, and they concede that changing health care will take time. But the companies see the potential in attracting a large audience for health-related advertising and services. And both companies bring formidable advantages to the consumer market for such technology.
Microsoft’s software animates more than 90 percent of all personal computers, while Google is the default starting point for most health searches. And people are increasingly turning to their computers and the Web  for health information and advice. A Harris poll, published last month, found that 52 percent of adults sometimes or frequently go to the Web for health information, up from 29 percent in 2001.
If the efforts of the two big companies gain momentum over time, that promises to accelerate a shift in  power to consumers in health care, just as Internet technology has done in other industries.
Today, about 20 percent of the nation’s patient population have  computerized records — rather than paper ones —  and the Bush administration has pushed the health care industry to speed up the switch to electronic formats. But these records still tend to be controlled by doctors, hospitals or insurers. A patient moves to another state, for example, but the record usually stays.
The Google and Microsoft initiatives would give much more control to individuals, a trend many health experts see as inevitable. “Patients will ultimately be the stewards of their own information,” said John D. Halamka, a doctor and the chief information officer of the Harvard Medical School.
Already the Web is allowing people to take a more activist approach to health. According to the Harris survey, 58 percent of people who look online for health information discussed what they found with their doctors in the last year.
It is common these days, Dr. Halamka said, for a patient to come in carrying a pile of Web page printouts. “The doctor is becoming a knowledge navigator,” he said. “In the future, health care will be a much more collaborative process between patients and doctors.”
Microsoft and Google are hoping this will lead people to seek more control over their own health records, using tools the companies will provide. Neither company will discuss their plans in detail. But Microsoft’s consumer-oriented effort is scheduled to be announced this fall, while Google’s has been delayed and will probably not be introduced until next year, according to people who have been briefed on the companies’ plans.
A prototype of Google Health, which the company has shown to health professionals and advisers, makes the consumer focus clear. The welcome page reads, “At Google, we feel patients should be in charge of their health information, and they should be able to grant their health care providers, family members, or whomever they choose, access to this information. Google Health was developed to meet this need.”
A presentation of screen images from the prototype — which two people who received it showed to a reporter — then has 17 other Web pages including a “health profile” for medications, conditions and allergies; a personalized “health guide” for suggested treatments, drug interactions and diet and exercise regimens; pages for receiving reminder messages to get prescription refills or visit a doctor; and directories of nearby doctors.
Google executives would not comment on the prototype, other than to say the company plans to  experiment and see what people want. “We’ll make mistakes and it will be a long-range march,” said Adam Bosworth, a vice president of engineering and leader of the health team. “But it’s also true that some of what we’re doing is expensive, and for Google it’s not.”
At Microsoft, the long-term goal is similarly ambitious. “It will take grand scale to solve these problems like the data storage, software and networking needed to handle vast amounts of personal health and medical information,” said Steve Shihadeh, general manager of Microsoft’s health solutions group. “So there are not many companies that can do this.”
This year, Microsoft bought a start-up, Medstory, whose search software is tailored for health information,  and last year bought a company that makes software for retrieving and displaying patient information in hospitals. Microsoft software is already used in hospitals, clinical laboratories and doctors’ offices, and, Mr. Shihadeh noted, the three most popular health record systems  in doctors’ offices  are built with Microsoft software and programming tools.
Microsoft will not disclose its product plans, but according to people working with the company the consumer effort will include online offerings as well as software to find, retrieve and store personal health information on  personal computers, cellphones and other kinds of digital devices —  perhaps even  a wristwatch with wireless Internet links some day.
Mr. Shihadeh declined to discuss specifics, but said, “We’re building a broad consumer health platform, and we view this challenge as far bigger than a personal health record, which is just scratching the surface.”
Yet personal health records promise to be a thorny challenge for practical and privacy reasons. To be most useful, a consumer-controlled record would include medical and treatment records from doctors, hospitals, insurers and laboratories. Under federal law, people can request and receive their personal health data within 90 days. But the process is complicated, and the replies typically come on paper, as photocopies or faxes.
The efficient way would be for  that data to be sent over the Internet into a person’s digital health record. But that would require partnerships and trust between health care providers and insurers and the digital record-keepers.
Privacy concerns are another big obstacle, as  both companies acknowledge. Most likely, they say, trust will build slowly, and the online records will include as much or as little personal information as users are comfortable divulging.
A person might start, for example, by typing in age, gender and a condition, like diabetes, as a way to find more personalized  health information. If a person creates a personal health record and later has second thoughts, a simple mouse click should erase it. The promise, the companies say, will be complete consumer control.
There are plenty of competitors these days in online health records and information from start-ups like Revolution Health, headed by AOL’s founder, Stephen M. Case, and thriving profit-makers led by WebMD.
Potential rivals are not underestimating the two technology giants. But the smaller companies have the advantage of being focused entirely on health, and some have been around for years. WebMD, for example,  traces its lineage to Healtheon, a fallen star of the dot-com era, founded by the Netscape billionaire Jim Clark.
Google and Microsoft are great companies, said Wayne T. Gattinella, WebMD’s chief executive, but “that doesn’t mean they will be expert in a specific area like health.”
Specialized health search engines — notably Healthline — are gaining ground and adding partners. AOL recently began using Healthline for searches on its health pages, even though Google is a close partner.
Still, 58 percent of people seeking health information online begin with a general search engine, according to a recent Jupiter Research report, and Google dominates the field. “Google is the entry point for most health search, and that is a huge advantage,” said Monique Levy, a Jupiter analyst.
Indeed, it is the market reach and deep pockets that Google and Microsoft can bring to consumer health information that intrigues medical experts, and has lured recruits. Dr. Roni Zeiger, a graduate of Stanford’s School of Medicine, a medical informatics researcher and a former primary care doctor, joined Google last year. The 36-year-old, who still sees patients some evenings and weekends at a nearby clinic, said, “At Google, I can use my expertise and knowledge to potentially help millions of people each day.”

In 2008, when it comes to health care, which is emerging as a defining domestic issue, voters will find stark differences in philosophy and commitment between Democrats and Republicans.
The three leading Democratic candidates all want to achieve universal or near universal health insurance coverage. The four leading Republican candidates espouse no such goal and barely mention the uninsured. The Democrats are willing to put substantial federal money into health care reform. The Republicans are not. The Democrats would expand government health insurance programs and give the federal government a greater role in regulating the insurance industry. The Republicans generally want to shrink federal programs and free the insurance industry from what they consider regulatory shackles.
Compared with these sharp differences between the two parties, the distinctions between leading candidates within each party are small, mostly a matter of tactics to achieve comparable goals. We far prefer the Democrats’ approach to health insurance, since at least they want to address an issue that must be resolved for reasons of economics, public health and fairness. Sadly, none of the leading candidates, in either party, has the vision or the political courage to propose radical solutions for the big underlying problem behind America’s health care crisis: the inexorably rising costs.
The Republican Candidates
Two Republican candidates have yet to grapple seriously with health care reform. John McCain, running largely on Iraq and national security, has not said anything substantial about health care, nor has he even included it among issues listed on his campaign Web site. Fred Thompson has only a brief paragraph on his Web site in which he opposes new mandates, higher taxes or a Washington-controlled program, and calls for free-market solutions. He has also called for reduced spending on entitlements and says he would have opposed the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Rudolph Giuliani, who leads the Republican field in national polls, has only sketchy plans but has made it clear that he favors free-market approaches and is strongly opposed to what he mislabels as the Democrats’ push for socialized medicine. Borrowing from President Bush, he proposes a tax deduction of up to $15,000 to help families buy private health insurance instead of getting it through their employers. He believes millions of people might choose that option, creating a market in which insurance companies would rush in with affordable policies to cover them, and the nation would begin to move away from the employer-based system that the Democrats are trying to bolster. For the poor, he envisions some combination of vouchers and tax refunds to help buy policies but has given no indication of how much that program would cost or how he would pay for it.
His proposals are not likely to make much of a dent in the ranks of the uninsured. Tax deductions are of little use to low-income people who pay little or no income tax, and insurers are notorious for refusing individual policies to high-risk or chronically ill people. Given Mr. Giuliani’s eagerness to ease regulation of insurance companies it is hard to see how he could make that market work better.
Mitt Romney has the most developed health plan among the Republicans, as one might expect given his prominent role in spurring health care reform in Massachusetts. As governor of that left-leaning state, he helped make Massachusetts a leader in providing universal coverage, mostly by mandating that everyone must buy health insurance or pay a financial penalty. But as a candidate in the Republican primaries he has changed course, disavowing any need for mandates and contending that what was right for Massachusetts would not be right for the country.
Instead of a national reform effort, he wants the 50 states to devise their own plans, but without much financial help from the federal government. He promises federal incentives to help states deregulate their health insurance markets to encourage  cheaper policies.
His key proposal at the national level centers on tax deductions to help people pay for health care. He would allow individuals to deduct their out-of-pocket expenditures — and any premiums paid for insurance policies they bought on their own rather than through their employer — from their taxable income. For those who still cannot afford coverage, he would encourage states to redirect money now used for charity care to help low-income people buy private health insurance. There would be no new federal money for this purpose. His advisers estimate the proposals would cost a modest $10 billion a year in reduced revenues to the United States  Treasury.
The problem of relying on tax deductions to increase insurance coverage is that they mostly favor the better off. The problem with relying on the states to enact the needed reforms is that the plight of the uninsured would be left to the whims of geography. Few states have the financial resources that allowed Massachusetts to move to universal coverage, and many states lack the expertise to mount a sophisticated program.
The Democratic Candidates
Although Republicans routinely lambaste the Democrats for supporting socialized medicine or government programs in which bureaucrats would dictate your health coverage, the plans put forth by the three leading Democratic candidates — Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards  — are all very careful to build on the existing system of employer-based coverage supplemented by government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program.
None of them is proposing a “single payer” system run by the government. And all bend over backward to reassure people that they can maintain their current coverage if they like it. Their political goal is to head off opposition from those who fear that their own coverage might suffer in the course of covering some 47 million uninsured people.
The Democratic plans have far more similarities than differences. All three would move toward universal coverage and would rely heavily on mandates to do so. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards would require everyone to take out health insurance. That would bring young and healthy people into the system to help subsidize coverage for the more sickly, and would eliminate the problem of “free riders,” who show up uninsured at the emergency room  and get very expensive care without paying. Mr. Obama would require parents to get insurance for their children but has no mandate for adults.
All three would require big employers to provide health insurance or contribute to the cost of covering their employees outside the workplace. But they differ in the treatment of small businesses, whose opposition helped derail the last big reform effort in 1993. Mr. Edwards is the toughest. He would require small businesses to provide insurance coverage or help pay for coverage elsewhere. Mr. Obama would exempt them from any mandate. Mrs. Clinton, in what looks suspiciously like a bribe to buy small business support, promises them a tax credit for providing coverage.
The Clinton plan would cost an estimated $110 billion a year, the Edwards plan $90 billion to $120 billion, the Obama plan $50 billion to $65 billion. All three would finance their programs partly by rolling back Bush-era tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year and partly with debatable savings they would get through cost-cutting.
All three would require insurers to accept everyone without regard to pre-existing conditions, would provide tax subsidies to low-income people, and would establish purchasing pools to help individuals get low group rates.
There would be a menu of options for people dissatisfied with their current policies because of high costs or limited benefits, including both private health plans and a public program that would compete alongside them. That would provide an interesting test of whether government or private plans are more effective and popular, a matchup that critics of “government-run” programs seem determined to avoid.
The Clinton plan has an innovative proposal to limit the premiums that families have to pay to a certain percentage of their income, as yet undefined. That is a welcome protection for consumers but could cause problems if medical costs continue to rise far faster than wages.
WHAT’S MISSING
All of the plans, both Republican and Democratic, fail to provide a plausible solution to the problem that has driven health care reform to the fore as a political issue: the inexorably rising costs that drive up insurance rates and force employers to cut back on coverage or charge higher premiums. All of the plans acknowledge the need to restrain costs, but most of the remedies they offer are not likely to do much.
Electronic medical records to eliminate errors and increase efficiency, more preventive care to head off serious diseases, and better coordination of patients suffering multiple, chronic illnesses are all worthy proposals, but there is scant evidence they will reduce costs. Proposals to import drugs from abroad, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, restrain malpractice expenses, increase competition among health plans, and empower consumers to shop more wisely for medical care might help a bit. But many experts doubt that any of this will truly put the brakes on escalating health care costs.
No top candidate in either party has broached more drastic remedies, like limiting the use of expensive new technologies, cutting reimbursements to doctors and hospitals, or forcing people to use health maintenance organizations. And no one has suggested imposing higher taxes on everyone, not just the wealthy, to finance universal coverage. These solutions are not even discussed on the campaign trail lest they alienate voters and interest groups.
At this stage, the various plans should be considered as broad outlines of where the candidates want to go, with details to be worked out later. Voters who put a high priority on covering all or most of the uninsured will prefer the Democrats’ approach, as we do. The chief danger is that the Democrats have a tendency to imply that everyone can be covered with good benefit packages without inconveniencing anyone but the wealthy. Their cost and savings assumptions will need thorough analysis when more detailed plans emerge.
Voters who put a higher priority on reshaping the health care system along free-market lines than on achieving universal coverage will prefer the Republican plans. Those plans’ likely impact on costs will also need to be analyzed when more details emerge. The “magic of the market” may be less than magical.
Given the wide split between Republican and Democratic approaches, the polarized politics in Washington, and the overriding need to find a way out of the morass in Iraq, it will be an uphill battle to achieve consensus on health care any time soon. But at least voters will have a clear choice of which way the candidates are headed.

Health care costs are far higher in the United States than in any other advanced nation, whether measured in total dollars spent, as a percentage of the economy, or on a per capita basis. And health costs here have been rising significantly faster than the overall economy or personal incomes for more than 40 years, a trend that cannot  continue forever.
It is the worst long-term fiscal crisis facing the nation, and it demands a solution, but finding one will not be easy or palatable.
 The Causes
Varied and Deep-Rooted. Contrary to popular beliefs, this is not a problem driven mainly by the aging of the baby boom generation, or the high cost of prescription drugs, or medical malpractice litigation that spawns defensive medicine. Those issues often dominate political discourse, but they have played relatively minor roles in driving up medical spending in this country and abroad. The major causes are much more deep-seated and far harder to root out.
Almost all economists would agree that the main driver of high medical spending here is our wealth. We are richer than other countries and so willing to spend more. But authoritative analyses have found that we spend well above what mere wealth would predict.
This is mostly because we pay hospitals and doctors more than most other countries do. We rely more on costly specialists, who overuse advanced technologies, like CT scans and M.R.I. machines, and who resort to costly surgical or medical procedures a lot more than doctors in other countries do. Perverse insurance incentives entice doctors and patients to use expensive medical services more than is warranted. And our fragmented array of insurers and providers eats up a lot of money in administrative costs, marketing expenses and profits that do not afflict government-run systems abroad.
Does It Matter? If citizens of an extremely wealthy nation like the United States want to spend more on health care and less on a third car, a new computer or a vacation home, what’s wrong with that? By some measures, Americans are getting good value. Studies by reputable economists have concluded that spending on such advanced treatments as cardiac drugs, devices and surgery; neonatal care for low-birth-weight infants; and mental health drugs have more than paid for themselves by extending lives and improving their quality.
But if health care spending continues on its same trajectory, the United States will reach the point — probably several decades from now — where every penny of the annual increase in gross domestic product would have to go for health care. There would be less and less money for other things, like education, environmental protection, scientific research and national security, that may be equally or more important to the well-being of society.
Governmental budgets will face the crisis even sooner. States are already complaining that they have to crimp other vital activities, like education, to meet soaring Medicaid costs. And federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is surging upward at rates that will cause the deficit to soar. That means politicians will have to raise taxes, severely cut a wide range of other governmental programs, or chop back the health programs themselves.
The question is: What can be done to lower both the high level of health care spending and its high rate of increase from year to year?
 The Solutions
Geography. Pioneering studies by researchers at Dartmouth have shown enormous disparities in expenditures on health care from one region to another with no discernible difference in health outcomes. Doctors in high-cost areas use hospitals, costly technology and platoons of consulting physicians a lot more often than doctors in low-cost areas, yet their patients, on average, fare no better. There are hints that they may even do worse because they pick up infections in the hospital and because having a horde of doctors can mean no one is in charge.
If the entire nation could bring its costs down to match the lower-spending regions, the country could cut perhaps 20 to 30 percent off its health care bill, a tremendous saving. That would require changing the long- ingrained practices of the medical profession. Public and private insurers might need to refuse coverage for high-cost care that adds little value.
Stick to What Works. The sad truth is that less than half of all medical care in the United States is supported by good evidence that it works, according to estimates cited by the Congressional Budget Office. If doctors had better information on which treatments work best for which patients, and whether the benefits were commensurate with the costs, needless treatment could be junked, the savings could be substantial, and patient care would surely improve. It could take a decade, or several, to conduct comparative-effectiveness studies, modify relevant laws, and change doctors’ behavior.
Managed Care. For a brief period in the 1990s it looked as if health maintenance organizations competing for patients and carefully managing their care might bring down costs and improve quality at the same time. The H.M.O.’s did help restrain costs for a few years. The problem was, doctors and patients hated the system, management became much looser, and the upsurge in costs resumed. Managed care techniques are creeping back into some health plans, especially for services apt to be overused, but too heavy a hand would most likely produce another backlash.
Information Technologies. The American health care system lags well behind other sectors of the economy — and behind foreign medical systems — in adopting computers, electronic health records and information-sharing technologies that can greatly boost productivity. There is little doubt that widespread computerization could greatly reduce the paperwork burden on doctors and hospitals, head off medication errors, and reduce the costly repetition of diagnostic tests as patients move from one doctor to another. Without an infusion of capital, the transition from paper records is not apt to happen very quickly.
Prevention. Everyone seems to be hoping that preventive medicine — like weight control, exercise, better nutrition, smoking cessation, regular checkups, aggressive screening and judicious use of drugs to reduce risks — will not only improve health but also lower costs in the long run. Preventive medicine actually costs money — somebody has to spend time counseling patients and screening them for disease — and it is not clear how soon, or even whether, substantial savings will show up. Still, the effort has to be made. The Milken Institute recently estimated that the most common chronic diseases cost the economy more than $1 trillion annually, mostly from lost worker productivity, which could balloon to nearly $6 trillion by the middle of the century.
Disease Management. Virtually all policy experts want more careful coordination of the care of chronically ill patients, who account for the largest portion of the nation’s health care expenditures. Although that should improve the quality of the care they get, coordination may not cut costs as substantially as people expect. In some initial trials it has cut costs, in others not.
Drug Prices. Compared with the residents of other countries, Americans pay much more for brand-name prescription drugs, less for generic and over-the-counter drugs, and roughly the same prices for biologics. This page believes it would be beneficial to allow Medicare to negotiate with manufacturers for lower prescription drug prices and to allow cheaper drugs to be imported from abroad. The prospect for big savings is dubious.
 Who Picks Up the Tab?
Pay Providers Less. With doctors dreadfully unhappy under the heavy hand of insurers, it would seem shortsighted to make them even unhappier by cutting their compensation to levels paid in other countries. But many experts believe it should be possible to tap into the vast flow of money sluicing through hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities to find savings.
Emphasize Primary Care. In a health system as uncoordinated as ours, many experts believe we could get better health results, possibly for less cost, if we changed reimbursement formulas and medical education programs to reward and produce more primary care doctors and fewer specialists inclined to proliferate high-cost services. It would be a long-term project.
Skin in the Game. The solution favored by many conservatives is to force consumers to shell out more money when they seek medical care so that they will think harder about whether it is really necessary. The “consumer-directed health care” movement calls for providing people with enough information about doctors and treatments so that they can make wise decisions.
There would most likely be some savings. A classic experiment by Rand researchers from 1974 to 1982 found that people who had to pay almost all of their own medical bills spent 30 percent less on health care than those whose insurance covered all their costs, with little or no difference in health outcomes. The one exception was low-income people in poor health, who went without care they needed. Any cost-sharing scheme would have to protect those unable to bear the burden.
And consumer-driven plans have limitations. Most health care spending is racked up by a small percentage of individuals whose bills are so high they are no longer subject to cost sharing; they will hardly be deterred from expensive care they desperately need. Moreover, few consumers have the competence or knowledge to second-guess a doctor’s recommendations.
Single Payer. Deep in their hearts, many liberals yearn for a single-payer system, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, that would have the federal government pay for all care and dictate prices. Such a system would let the government offset the price-setting strength of the medical and pharmaceutical industries, eliminate much of the waste due to a multiplicity of private insurance plans, and greatly cut administrative costs.
But a single-payer system is no panacea for the cost problem — witness Medicare’s own cost troubles — and the approach has limited political support. Private insurers could presumably eliminate some of the waste through uniform billing and payment procedures.
•
By now it should be clear that there is no silver bullet to restrain soaring health care costs. A wide range of contributing factors needs to be tackled simultaneously, with no guarantee they will have a substantial impact any time soon. In many cases we do not have enough solid information to know how to cut costs without impairing quality. So we need to get cracking on a range of solutions. The cascade of knowledge flowing from the human genome project, new nanotechnologies and the advent of treatments tailor-made for individual patients may well accelerate, not mitigate, the rise in medical spending. If we want the benefits, we will need to make them affordable.

The two programs, for older Americans and low-income people, cost $627 billion last year and accounted for 23 percent of all federal spending. With no change in existing law, the Congressional Budget Office says, that cost will double in 10 years and the programs will account for more than 30 percent of the budget.
Economists and health policy experts say the federal health programs are unsustainable in their current form, because they are growing much faster than the economy or the revenues used to finance them. The Medicare program is especially endangered; its hospital insurance trust fund is expected to run out of money in 11 years.
But the need for cutbacks is not a popular theme for political candidates wooing voters who want more care at a lower cost.
The Democrats do not say, in any detail, how they would slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid or what they think about the main policy options: rationing care, raising taxes, cutting payments to providers or requiring beneficiaries to pay more.
Nor do they say how they would overcome the health care industry lobby, which has blocked proposals for even modest reductions in Medicare payment rates.
Instead, scores of lawyers and lobbyists are continually urging Congress to expand Medicare coverage of specific drugs, medical devices, tests and procedures.
The leading edge of the baby boom generation becomes eligible for Medicare in three years. The number of beneficiaries, now 44 million, is expected to reach 49 million in the first term of the next president and then climb to 55 million by 2017.
Those numbers, while daunting, are less significant than other factors.
Peter R. Orszag, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said, “The bulk of the projected increase in spending on Medicare and Medicaid is due not to demographic changes, such as increases in the number of beneficiaries, but to increases in costs per beneficiary.”
And what is driving those costs?
“Most of the long-term rise in health care spending is associated with the use of new medical technologies,” the budget office said in a recent report. It suggested that more selective use could save substantial amounts — a prospect that alarms manufacturers of some medical devices.
“Medical technology has saved and improved countless lives by reducing disability and death rates from cancer, heart disease and other conditions,” said Stephen J. Ubl, president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group.
Spending on Medicare and Medicaid tends to increase in tandem with health spending generally.
“Federal health spending trends should not be viewed in isolation from the health care system as a whole,” said David M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States.
When Medicare and Medicaid squeeze payments to doctors and hospitals, health care providers often try to increase charges to other patients, Mr. Walker said. To rein in the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, he said, it will be necessary to slow the growth of health costs generally.
For several years, an independent federal panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, has recommended that Congress reduce payments to private health plans. Those payments are about 12 percent higher, on average, than the cost of caring for similar patients in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.
Insurance companies, working with satisfied customers and lawmakers who want to preserve access to such plans, have successfully resisted the proposal.
To help pay for their coverage plans, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama both say they would roll back the “Bush tax cuts” for the wealthiest Americans. But major provisions of the tax cuts, adopted in 2001 and 2003, are already scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Democratic lawmakers, moreover, have committed the savings from the elapsed tax cuts several times to other pet programs, like eliminating the alternative minimum tax.
Some experts say the only real way to tame health care costs is by limiting access to expensive treatments or by requiring affluent Americans to pay for more of their health care.
Medicare has generally not taken costs into account in deciding which services to cover. If officials even suggest that Medicare should deny payment for an expensive treatment that could produce a small improvement in a person’s condition, they are accused of rationing care.
Researchers at Dartmouth Medical School have found large variations in the amount of hospital care and other services that people with the same condition receive in different parts of the country. In some regions, where doctors favor more intensive treatments, Medicare spends much more without getting better results for patients.
This research “suggests that about 20 percent of Medicare spending could be eliminated with no adverse effects on health,” said Prof. David M. Cutler of Harvard, an adviser to the Obama campaign. Identifying that 20 percent would be “very difficult,” he acknowledged.
President Bush says high-income people should pay higher premiums for the Medicare drug benefit, and at least some liberals are willing to discuss the idea.
“We can go further in setting Medicare premiums at higher levels for affluent beneficiaries without unraveling the universal nature of the program,” said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But, he insists, “we should also eliminate billions of dollars in overpayments to private Medicare plans.”
The Democratic candidates do believe they can wring savings out of an inefficient health care system that spent an average of $7,400 a person last year, far more than any other country.
Mr. Obama says his plan can achieve “tremendous savings” by making the health care system more efficient. Mrs. Clinton says her plan will save more than $50 billion a year with “efficiency reforms.”
To this end, Democrats and some Republicans are coalescing behind proposals intended to improve care while lowering costs. These proposals call for greater use of health information technology, including electronic medical records, programs to manage the care of people with multiple chronic diseases and research to compare the effectiveness of different treatments.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, describes Medicare as a “fiscal train wreck.” He voted against adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003 because, he said, it added huge costs to a program going broke.
Mr. McCain says he, too, wants to cover more people. But he has not explicitly embraced the goal of universal coverage, saying he worries more about costs.
Public opinion polls show broad support for federal action to cover the uninsured. But Robert D. Reischauer, a health policy expert and president of the Urban Institute, said, “It will be difficult for Senator Clinton and Senator Obama to retain popular support for their plans once the details are specified.”

The dean of the Public Health School lifted the restrictions after learning of them.
A spokesman for the school, Timothy M. Parsons, said the restrictions were enforced starting in February.
Johns Hopkins manages the population database known as Popline with money from the Agency for International Development.
Popline is the world’s largest database on reproductive health, with more than 360,000 records and articles on family planning, fertility and sexually transmitted diseases.
Mr. Parsons said the development agency had expressed concern after finding “two articles about abortion advocacy” in the database. The articles, he said, did not fit database criteria and were removed.
Employees who manage the database instructed their computers to ignore the word “abortion” as a search term.
After learning of the restrictions on Friday, the dean, Dr. Michael J. Klag, said: “I could not disagree more strongly with this decision, and I have directed that the Popline administrators restore ‘abortion’ as a search term immediately. I will also launch an inquiry to determine why this change occurred.”
The school is named for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a Hopkins alumnus who has given millions of dollars to the university and the school.
Dr. Klag said the school was “dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, and not its restriction.”
Ted Miller, a spokesman for Naral Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group, said: “The public has a right to know why someone would censor relevant medical information. The Bush administration has politicized science as part of an ideological agenda. So it’s important to know if that occurred here.”
A woman answering telephones at the Agency for International Development said officials were not available because they were at a retreat.
Librarians at the Medical Center of the University of California, San Francisco, expressed concern about the restrictions this week after they had difficulty retrieving articles from Popline.
In an e-mail response on Tuesday, Johns Hopkins told the librarians that “abortion” was no longer a valid search term.
“We recently made all abortion terms stop words,” Debra L. Dickson, a Popline manager, wrote. “As a federally funded project, we decided this was best for now.”
Ms. Dickson suggested that instead of using “abortion,” librarians could use other terms like “fertility control, postconception” or “pregnancy, unwanted.”
Gail L. Sorrough,  director of medical library services at the medical center in San Francisco, said it was absurd to restrict searches using “a perfectly good noun such as ‘abortion.’ ”
Under the rule, Popline ignored the word “abortion,” just as it ignores terms like “a” and “the.” Ms. Sorrough and a colleague, Gloria Won, reported their experience on an electronic mailing list, and librarians protested the restrictions.
“We sent this out on a listserv, and it just exploded,” Ms. Sorrough said. “Eliminating this term essentially blocks access to reports in the database and ultimately to information about abortion. Unwanted pregnancy is not a synonym for abortion.”
Items on Popline include articles on “demand for abortion by unmarried teenagers” and federal judges’ abortion rulings.

The authors, Dr. Kenneth D. Mandl and Dr. Isaac S. Kohane, are longtime proponents of the benefits of electronic patient records to improve care and help individuals make smarter health decisions.
But their concern, stated in the article published Wednesday and in an interview, is that the medical profession and policy makers have not begun to grapple with the implications of companies like Microsoft and Google becoming the hosts for vast stores of patient information.
The arrival of these new corporate entrants, the authors write, promises to bring “a seismic change” in the control and stewardship of patient information.
Today, most patient records remain within the health system  —  in doctors’ offices, hospitals, clinics, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy networks. Federal regulations govern how personal information can be shared among health institutions and insurers, and the rules restrict how such information can be mined for medical research. One requirement is that researchers have no access to individual patients’ identities, although there can sometimes be exceptions to those restrictions, if they are approved by an independent ethical review panel.
Under the current system, individuals can request their own health records, but it is often a cumbersome process because information is scattered across several institutions.
As part of a push toward greater individual control of health information,  Microsoft and Google have recently begun offering Web-based personal health records. The journal article’s authors describe a new  “personalized, health information economy” in which consumers tell physicians, hospitals and other providers what information to send into their personal records, stored by Microsoft or Google. It is  the individual who decides with whom  to share that information  and under what terms.
But Microsoft and Google, the authors note, are not bound by the privacy restrictions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, the main law that regulates personal data handling and patient privacy. Hipaa, enacted in 1996, did not anticipate Web-based health records systems like the ones Microsoft and Google now offer.
The authors say that consumer control of personal data  under the new, unregulated Web systems  could open the door to all kinds of marketing and false advertising from parties eager for valuable patient information.
Despite their warnings, Dr. Mandl and Dr. Kohane are enthusiastic about the potential benefits of Web-based personal health records, including a patient population of better-informed, more personally responsible health consumers.
“In very short order, a few large companies could hold larger patient databases than any clinical research center anywhere,” Dr. Mandl said in an interview.
But the authors see a need for safeguards, suggesting  a mixture of federal regulation  —  perhaps extending Hipaa to online patient record hosts —  contract relationships, certification standards and consumer education programs.
“I’m a great believer in patient autonomy in general, but there is going to have to be some measure of limited paternalism,” Dr. Kohane said in an interview.
Peter Neupert, the vice president in charge of Microsoft’s health group, said that he admired the authors and that they raised some important issues. But he resisted the suggestion of extending Hipaa to newcomers like Microsoft and Google.
“Philosophically and politically, I am skeptical of the concept of paternalism,” Mr. Neupert said in an e-mail response to the article, which he was sent, and to the authors’ comments. “It never turns out to be ‘limited.’ ”
Designing a health records system that clearly informs consumers and requires their consent for data use is the better approach, Mr. Neupert said.
“We have to earn the consumer’s trust for our brand,” he said. “So I can imagine a scenario where we have a third party verify that our system works the way we assert it does,” much as an auditor reviews a company’s financial reporting.
Dr. Mandl and Dr. Kohane are physicians and researchers at Children’s Hospital Boston, the primary pediatric teaching hospital of the Harvard Medical School.

Grossman, a health care analyst at Harvard and leading hospital administrator who was influential in applying engineering solutions to make medical care more efficient, died on April 1 at his home in Boston. He was 68.
The cause was renal cell carcinoma, his family said.
Trained as an internist, Dr. Grossman saw a need early in his career for more accurate, complete and portable medical histories. In the late 1960s, relying on the emerging technology of computers, he and others at Massachusetts General Hospital advocated an “automated” records system that could be easily tapped by everyone involved in a patient’s treatment.
The result, with Dr. Grossman’s input, was an electronic records system that appeared in the 1970s and was used successfully by the Harvard Community Health Plan.
In 1979, Dr. Grossman was named president of the New England Medical Center, now the Tufts Medical Center in Boston. He was frequently involved in panel discussions on new ideas for extending insurance coverage and improving hospital safety and patient care.
Dr. Denis A. Cortese, president and chief executive of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Dr. Grossman rapidly became nationally known as an advocate for market-driven solutions and was “heavily and persuasively engaged” in recommending the establishment of a federal health board to oversee health care nationwide, a medical counterpart of the Federal Aviation Administration. The idea was to have issues of safety and even insurance reported directly to regulators, Dr. Cortese explained, without other agencies intervening.
At his death, Dr. Grossman was working on a book about health care policy, “The Innovator’s Prescription: A Disruptive Solution to Our Health Care Crisis,” expected to be published this year by McGraw-Hill. A co-author, Clayton M. Christensen, a professor of business administration at Harvard, said Dr. Grossman had concluded that outpatient clinics, more sophisticated technology in doctors’ offices and larger roles for nurses and physicians’ assistants were crucial to lowering costs and raising the quality of care.
Dr. Christensen also noted that Dr. Grossman’s experience as a practitioner, administrator and employer put him in an unusual position to cross the “boundaries of business, policy and academia.”
Jerome Harvey Grossman was born in Newark, N.J. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before earning a medical degree in 1965 from the University of Pennsylvania.
From 1984 to 1995, he was chairman and chief executive of the New England Medical Center and a professor of medicine at Tufts. In 1997, Dr. Grossman was named a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard; he later became a senior fellow and directed the Health Care Delivery Program.
He was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 1994 to 1997.
Dr. Grossman is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Barbara Lieb. The couple lived in Boston and Sandwich, N.H. He is also survived by three daughters, Amelia and Elizabeth, both of Washington, and Kate Sutliff of Newton, Mass.; and a brother, Dr. Sy Grossman, a gastroenterologist, of Berkeley, Calif.

The report, published online on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that doctors who use electronic health records say overwhelmingly that such records  have helped improve the quality and timeliness of care. Yet fewer than one in five of the nation’s doctors has  started using such records.
Bringing patient records into the computer age, experts say, is crucial to improving care, reducing errors and containing costs in the American health care system. The slow adoption of the technology is mainly economic. Most doctors in private practice, especially those in small practices, lack the  financial incentive to invest in computerized records.
The national survey found that electronic  records were used in less than 9 percent of small offices with one to three doctors, where nearly half of the country’s doctors practice medicine.
Dr. Paul Feldan, one of three doctors in a primary care practice in Mount  Laurel, N.J., considered investing in electronic health records, and decided against it. The initial cost of upgrading the office’s personal computers, buying new software and obtaining technical support to make the shift would be $15,000 to $20,000 a doctor, he estimated. Then, during the time-consuming conversion from paper to computer records, the practice would be able to see far fewer patients, perhaps doubling the cost.
“Certainly, the idea of electronic records is terrific,” Dr. Feldan said. “But if we don’t see patients, we don’t get paid. The economics of it just seem so daunting.”
Private and government insurers and hospitals can save money as a result of less paper handling,  lower administration expenses and fewer unnecessary lab tests when they are connected to electronic health records in doctors’  offices.  Still, it is mainly doctors who bear the burden making the initial investment.
“We have a broken market for electronic health record adoption because the people who gain financially are not the people who pay,” said Dr. Blackford Middleton, a health technology expert at Partners Healthcare, a nonprofit medical group that includes Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
To fix the market, Dr. Middleton, like others, recommends that the government play a role in providing incentives or subsidies to speed the use of computerized patient records in the United States, whose adoption rate trails most developed nations.
The government took a step in that direction last week, announcing a $150 million Medicare  project that will offer doctors incentives to move from paper to electronic patient records. The program is intended to help up to 1,200 small practices in 12 cities and states make the conversion.
Individual doctors will be offered up to $58,000 over the five-year span of the project, which is intended to test the impact of incentives on the spread of electronic health records. Further programs across the country are planned.
The report published in the journal also found that electronic health records were used by 51 percent of larger practices, with 50 or more doctors.
Indeed, electronic health records are pervasive in the largest integrated medical groups like Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and others. These integrated groups not only have deep pockets. By combining doctors, clinics, hospitals and often some insurance they can also capture the financial savings from electronic health records.
The findings of the study, which was paid for by the Department of Health and Human Services and a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, broadly echo previous research on the adoption of electronic health records. Large medical groups have long been the early adopters, and small practices have struggled.
But the new study is based on a large sampling  — more than 2,600 doctors across the country — and a detailed survey, making it more definitive than past research, experts say. The results, they say, also show a strong endorsement of electronic health records by doctors who have them, especially for what the report termed “fully functional” records, which include reminders of care guidelines, based on a patient’s age, gender or medical history.
For example, 82 percent of those using such electronic records said they improved the quality of clinical decisions, 86 percent said they helped in avoiding medication errors and 85 percent said they improved the delivery of preventative care.
“Those numbers are huge and very encouraging,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, the former health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration.
Dr. Brailer also pointed to the 54 percent of doctors without electronic health records who said that not finding an electronic health record that met their needs was a “major barrier” to adoption. In short, they are not satisfied with the existing products, which tend to be designed for hospitals — big customers — instead of small practices.
“What we see is a deficit in innovation, and that is something innovators and the capital markets can address,” said Dr. Brailer, who  leads a firm that invests in medical ventures, Health Evolution Partners.
One wave of innovation is coming from big technology companies, like Microsoft and Google, which recently have begun services that offer consumer-controlled personal health records over the Web, which are stored in the companies’ data centers. These consumer-controlled health records are intended to link up and exchange information with electronic patient records in doctors’ offices and hospitals.
Dr. Peter Masucci, a pediatrician with his own office in Everett, Mass., embraced  electronic health records to “try to get our practice into the 21st century.”
He  could not afford conventional software, and chose a Web-based service from Athenahealth, a company supplying online financial and electronic health record services to doctors’ offices.
Dr. Masucci was already using Athenahealth’s outsourced financial service, and less than two years ago adopted the online medical record.
Today, Dr. Masucci is an enthusiast, talking about the wealth of patient information, drug interaction warnings and guidelines for care, all in the Web-based records.
“Do I see more patients because of this technology? Probably no,” Dr. Masucci said. “But I am doing a better job with the patients I am seeing. It almost forces you to be a better doctor.”

27,852,2008-07-23T00:00:00Z,article,Health Plan From Obama Spurs Debate,548337e138f0d80df4fa328c,"persons:Obama, Barack, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Presidential Election of 2008",National,0.0,None,Whether Barack Obama can deliver on his pledge to reduce premiums is a matter of dispute among analysts.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/us/23health.html,1377,Whether Barack Obama can deliver on his pledge to reduce premiums is a matter of dispute among analysts.,"It is one of the most audacious promises in a campaign that has been thick with them.
In speech after speech, Senator Barack Obama has vowed that he will lower the country’s health care costs enough to “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.” Moreover, Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has promised that his health plan will be in place “by the end of my first term as president of the United States.”
Whether Mr. Obama can deliver is a matter of considerable dispute among health analysts and economists. While there is consensus that the American health care system is bloated with waste, eliminating enough to save $2,500 per family would require simultaneous and synergistic solutions to a host of problems that have proved intractable for decades.
Even if the next president and Congress can muster the political will, analysts question whether significant savings would materialize in as little as four years, or even in 10. But as Mr. Obama confronts an electorate that is deeply unsettled by escalating health costs, he is offering a precise “chicken in every pot” guarantee based on numbers that are largely unknowable. Furthermore, it is not completely clear what he is promising.
His words about lowering “premiums” by $2,500 for the average family of four have been fairly consistent. But the health policy advisers who formulated the figure say it actually represents the average family’s share of savings not only in premiums paid by individuals, but also in premiums paid by employers and in tax-supported health programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
“What we’re trying to do,” said one of the advisers, David M. Cutler, in explaining the gap between Mr. Obama’s words and his intent, “is find a way to talk to people in a way they understand.”
The original arithmetic was somewhat basic. In May 2007, three Harvard professors who  are unpaid advisers to the Obama campaign — Mr. Cutler, David Blumenthal and Jeffrey Liebman — produced a memorandum offering their “best guess” that a menu of changes would produce savings of at least $200 billion a year (it has since been revised to $214 billion). That would amount to about 8 percent of the $2.5 trillion in health care spending projected for 2009, when the next president takes office.
The memorandum attributed specific savings to several broad initiatives, with the numbers plucked from recent studies. Investments in computerized medical records would save $77 billion a year, the advisers wrote. Reducing administrative costs in the insurance industry would yield up to $46 billion. Improving prevention programs and chronic disease management would be worth $81 billion.
The total savings were then divided by the country’s population, multiplied for a family of four, and rounded down slightly to a number that was easy to grasp: $2,500. The average cost of family coverage bought through an employer was $12,106 in 2007, with workers paying $3,281 of that amount, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.
Mr. Obama aspires to cover the country’s 47 million uninsured by requiring insurers to accept all comers, regardless of their health status, and by providing generous tax credits to low-income workers. The tax credits could be used to buy into a new federal health plan or private plans marketed through a government exchange.
The subsidies are expensive, estimated at well over $100 billion. Other components of the Obama plan also bear up-front costs, like a pledge to spend $50 billion over five years to speed the computerization of health records, $6 billion a year on tax credits to small businesses that provide coverage to workers, and an unspecified amount to buffer businesses from high-cost insurance claims.
The source Mr. Obama has identified to pay for them — the repeal of President Bush’s tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 — would cover only about half. That means additional health care savings would be needed, not only to keep premiums under control but also to help pay for the subsidies.
A consensus has emerged among health economists that at least a third of the country’s spending on health care is unnecessary. Both Mr. Obama, of Illinois, and his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, agree that significant sums could be saved through reductions in unneeded procedures and improvements in electronic record-keeping, prevention and chronic disease management.
But the dollar values Mr. Obama has attached to individual components of his plan are beginning to attract scrutiny. In particular, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in May questioning the amount to be saved from the computerization of health systems.
Mr. Obama took his estimate of $77 billion a year from a 2005 study by the RAND Corporation (which cautioned that reductions of that magnitude would not emerge for 15 years). The Congressional analysts found, however, that for various methodological reasons the RAND study was “not an appropriate guide” to potential savings.
This month, Mr. Obama’s health advisers tried to recast the debate so that the questioning of any one number would not undermine the plan’s broader credibility. They enlisted eight health policy experts to sign a letter that, without endorsing the math behind any single initiative, proclaimed it was “not only possible, but likely” that Mr. Obama could save $200 billion annually. They did not say by when.
Mr. Cutler, who helped collect the signatures, said he and his colleagues had decided “that our attempt to lay out one plausible scenario for the savings had created more problems than it had solved.” He added: “Putting the debate where this message puts it — do you believe we can save 8 percent of health spending through a major series of public and private reforms — asks the question in a way that is much more productive than the issue of ‘Do you believe a single estimate among many, many studies?’ ”
Mr. Obama’s economic policy director, Jason Furman, said the campaign’s estimates were conservative and asserted that much of the savings would come quickly. “We think we could get to $2,500 in savings by the end of the first term, or be very close to it,” Mr. Furman said.
The campaign won additional backing this week from Kenneth E. Thorpe of Emory University, an authority on health care costs who helped formulate Bill Clinton’s failed plan in 1993. In an assessment that he initiated in coordination with the campaign, Mr. Thorpe wrote that if all of Mr. Obama’s proposals were enacted they would reduce  health spending by between $203 billion and $273 billion by 2012. He calculated that half of the savings would accrue to the federal government.
The Obama advisers said that while not all of the savings would translate into lower premiums, consumers would gain in other ways. The savings to employers would be passed along as higher wages, they predicted, and the savings to government would eventually mean either lower taxes or added benefits.
But whether employers and governments respond that way cannot be guaranteed, particularly in a difficult economy. And a number of health policy experts have questioned whether the $2,500 projection is either fiscally or politically realistic. Reducing health care costs, they emphasized, means taking money from someone’s pocket and rationing care that Americans have come to expect, a recipe for stiff resistance.
“There is no easy money because, as the saying goes, one person’s fraud and abuse is another person’s income,” said Joseph R. Antos of the American Enterprise Institute. “I wouldn’t think that four years or eight years or probably 10 years will be enough to see numbers of that sort.”
The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group in New York, published a study in December projecting that a robust overhaul consisting of 15 broad initiatives would generate savings of only 6 percent after 10 years. “Doing it by the end of a first term is ambitious and would require tough policies,” said Karen Davis, the group’s president.
Jonathan B. Oberlander, who teaches health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, called it wishful thinking. “Do they have the potential to generate significant savings in the long run?” Dr. Oberlander asked. “Yes. Do I believe they will produce substantial savings in the short run that can be used to finance Obama’s plan? No.”

PAUL — If an auto mechanic accidentally breaks your windshield while trying to repair the engine, he would never get away with billing you for fixing his mistake. On Wednesday, Medicare will start applying that logic to American medicine on a broad scale when it stops paying hospitals for the added cost of treating patients who are injured in their care.
Medicare, which provides coverage for the elderly and disabled, has put 10 “reasonably preventable” conditions on its initial list, saying it will not pay when patients receive incompatible blood transfusions, develop infections after certain surgeries or must undergo a second operation to retrieve a sponge left behind from the first. Serious bed sores, injuries from falls and urinary tract infections caused by catheters are also on the list.
Officials believe that the regulations could apply to several hundred thousand hospital stays of the 12.5 million covered annually by Medicare. The policy will also prevent hospitals from billing patients directly for costs generated by medical errors.
Because Medicare is the largest insurer in the country, its decision to refuse payment for preventable conditions has already influenced others — public and private — to set similar criteria.
Over the last year, four state Medicaid programs, including New York’s, have announced that they will not pay for as many as 28 “never events” (so called because they are never supposed to happen). So have some of the country’s largest commercial insurers, including WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in seven states.
A number of state hospital associations, including here in Minnesota, have brokered voluntary agreements that members will not bill for medical errors. In April, Maine became the first state to ban the practice statutorily.
The Congressionally mandated Medicare measure is not projected to yield large savings — $21 million a year, compared with $110 billion spent on inpatient care in 2007. But it carries great symbolism in the Bush administration’s efforts to revamp the country’s medical payment system, which has long been criticized as driving up costs through perverse incentives that reward the quantity of care more than the promotion of health.
The real money, many health economists believe, may come from reorienting the payment system to encourage prevention and chronic disease management and to discourage unnecessary procedures. The two major-party presidential candidates support such a realignment, a rare point of consensus in a polarized health care debate.
“This is a specific case of the larger pay-for-performance trend, the idea that you should pay more for quality than lack of quality, or in this case pay less for defects,” said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. “This whole trend is like a juggernaut, and it is not going to stop.”
Pay-for-performance makes use of both the carrot and the stick. Medicare now grants bonuses to doctors and hospitals that report quality measures. It is experimenting with rewarding physicians who follow protocols for treating diabetes, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an arm of Congress, recently recommended reducing payments to hospitals with high readmission rates.
Three years ago, HealthPartners, a Minnesota-based health maintenance organization, was first in the country to refuse payment to hospitals for never events. Company officials said the policy has yet to save much money. But at Regions Hospital in St. Paul, which is owned by HealthPartners, the change has reinforced a new focus on reducing medical errors.
“Historically, there’s been some acceptance that these things happen,” said Brock D. Nelson, the hospital’s president. “We’ve come to now accept that they’re avoidable. And that’s a sea change.”
Some improvements have been technological, like an electronic prescribing system that has helped cut medication errors in half. Others are breathtaking in their obviousness, like diligent hand-washing.
Nurses have been trained to provide more information during shift changes about whether patients are prone to falls. High-risk medications like heparin are now marked with pink labels to ward against mix-ups.
Shortly before Cynthia A. Kehborn’s recent ankle fusion surgery, her orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Peter A. Cole, checked records and asked her repeatedly whether he would be operating on her left leg. He then took a sterile marker and signed his initials on her left ankle.
As they prepared for surgery, technicians tallied sponges and blades so they could later be sure that none were left behind. Before taking up his scalpel, Dr. Cole was reminded by the “Time-Out!” towel covering his surgical tray to call for a brief break.
“We have Cynthia here for a left ankle fuse,” he announced. “Does everybody agree?” After all in the room chimed their agreement, he made his incision.
In pre-op, Ms. Kehborn, 48, said it had never occurred to her that patients might be charged for a medical error.
“It should be the hospital’s and doctor’s responsibility to step up to the plate and own up to their mistakes,” she said. “I’d be livid if we had to pay for it.”
The patient safety movement picked up steam in this country in 1999, when the Institute of Medicine, a prestigious advisory group, estimated that 44,000 to 98,000 Americans died each year from preventable medical errors.
In response, at least 20 states have passed laws requiring hospitals to report mistakes or preventable infections publicly, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services now requires hospitals to report on 42 quality measures. Hospitals that do not fully report may be docked up to 2 percent of their reimbursement.
In 2002, the National Quality Forum, a standard-setting consortium for the health care industry, compiled a list of 27 largely preventable adverse events, a list that grew to 28 in 2006 with the addition of “artificial insemination with the wrong donor sperm or egg.” In 2003, Minnesota became the first state to require reporting of all errors on the list, and last year the state’s hospital association became the first to announce that its members would not bill for them.
The number of never events in Minnesota reported to the state has been low — 106 in 2004-5, 154 in 2005-6 and 125 in 2006-7. The most frequent errors have been bed sores, retained objects and wrong-site surgeries. Regions Hospital had six or seven reportable errors in each of those years, including one death, a suicide.
Because individual hospitals may report only a few serious errors a year, they have started collaborating to look for common threads and propose solutions. Some of the innovations were initially greeted with rolled eyes, but hospital officials say that has lessened. Nonetheless, studies by the University of Minnesota found that some of the safety procedures, like the pre-surgery time-outs, have largely become rote.
Clear trend lines are not expected for several years. Some states have found through audits that not all errors are being reported, but Minnesota officials believe that compliance is high.
“There’s been an understanding by hospitals that we’re not trying to get them, that we’re really focused on what we can learn from these events,” said Diane C. Rydrych, the state health department official in charge of reporting.
Nancy E. Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety at the American Hospital Association, said hospitals had generally accepted that many of the 28 adverse events should never happen, like giving a patient the wrong type of blood. But she said other areas could be gray, like an injury caused by a malfunctioning device.
“Anyone — I don’t care who they are — always finds it a little provocative to be held accountable for something that is not within their control, especially when you have dedicated yourself to doing the right thing for your patients,” Ms. Foster said. Such unforgiving standards, she said, can “set an expectation among patients that staff will be closer to perfect than they actually can achieve.”
Even America’s Health Insurance Plans, the leading industry trade group, has questioned whether some of the conditions on the Medicare list are always preventable.
But Peter V. Lee, executive director of the Pacific Business Group on Health, based in San Francisco, said occasional inequity was a price worth paying to send the message that careless medicine will not be tolerated. “I don’t worry about that 1-in-100 case that can’t be avoided,” he said, “because the benefit of not paying for the 99 that shouldn’t happen means a far greater focus on avoiding harm. What we want is to encourage doctors and hospitals to get to zero.”

New tools are being developed that may help harried patients, including those with chronic health conditions, monitor their medications, home tests and other details. The information can then be posted to a Web page that the patient can choose to share with a doctor, pharmacist, friend or caregiver.
Zume Life, of San Jose, Calif.,  for example, is testing a small hand-held device, the Zuri, that prompts users to take their pills on schedule and to keep track of health-related matters like diet and exercise.
“We’re going after users who are mobile, social, active people” who need to follow a health routine in the midst of busy lives, said Rajiv Mehta, the chief executive of Zume Life.
All of the data from this pocket-size electronic minder, which beeps or flashes when it’s time  to take a pill, are uploaded to a Web portal. There, users can inspect, for example, graphs or charts of their exercise or other activities of the last few days or week. And, if the users wish, a caregiver can do so, too.
The Zuri will cost about $200 when it is released in the spring,  Mr. Mehta said. Users will also pay about $40 to $50 a month for Web services. A software version of the device that will run on an iPhone is also in the works.
Kathleen Weaver, a high school teacher of computer science in the Dallas Independent School District, is testing a Zuri, using it to keep track of symptoms as well as medication related to diabetes, cardiovascular complications and a persistent cough.
“If I had to write all of this down, I don’t think I could,” she said. “I’m busy all day taking care of other people.”
People who are monitoring their health at home may also take advantage of new online data-storage services being developed by Google, Microsoft and other companies. HealthVault (www.healthvault.com) by Microsoft lets users upload data directly to their account from about 50 devices, including many blood pressure and heart rate monitors, blood glucose meters and weight scales,  said Sean Nolan, a computer scientist and chief architect of the Microsoft Health Solutions Group in Redmond, Wash.
Owners of the account can then share the data with, say, a nurse or case manager who is tracking how they are responding to a new medication. They can also share information with compatible applications —  for example, a free blood pressure manager program from the American Heart Association (www.americanheart.org).
The number of applications that can exchange information with HealthVault is growing, Mr. Nolan said. NoMoreClipboard (www.nomoreclipboard.com), for instance, can draw data from HealthVault to fill in information in medical forms typically required for an initial visit to a doctor. (The basic service is free.)
TrialX (www.Trialx.org) matches patients to relevant clinical trials based on their health information (no charge for patients).
Users of HealthVault can even arrange to have faxes sent directly to their accounts  through a number arranged with MaxEmail (www.maxemail.com). All faxes sent to the number, like those for immunization records and lab results, are automatically uploaded to the account ($8.95 a year).
Until recently, there was no easy way for most people to make their health information available to others on the Web, said David Lansky, president and chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, in San Francisco, a coalition of health care buyers.
But people will use the new sites being developed by Google, Microsoft and others as they now  use online tools to manage their finances, travel and shopping, Mr. Lansky said.
“This is part of a shift toward a medical system that is more centered on and directed by patients themselves,” he said.
First, however, patients will have to become comfortable placing medical data like readings from home tests online.
Mr. Nolan of Microsoft said that with  HealthVault,  “you, the account holder, control your health information”  and can decide whether and what to share.
If people’s concerns about confidentiality and security are addressed successfully, online repositories could  have advantages, said Dr. Robert Steinbrook, a national correspondent for The New England Journal of Medicine.
For example, Dr. Steinbrook  said, “a nurse could review information about weight on a daily basis sent directly from a scale to a repository, and not necessarily have to send out someone to weigh a patient.”
But such programs are still under development, he said, and “all of this remains to be seen.”

Our health care system needs a similar revolution.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/opinion/24beane.html,768,Baseball’s numbers-crunchers now routinely use statistics to put better teams on the field for less money. Our health care system needs a similar revolution.,"IN the past decade, baseball has experienced a data-driven information revolution. Numbers-crunchers now routinely use statistics to put better teams on the field for less money. Our overpriced, underperforming health care system needs a similar revolution.
Data-driven baseball has produced surprising results. Michael Lewis writes in “Moneyball” that the Oakland A’s have won games and division titles at one-sixth the cost of the most profligate teams.  This season, the New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers and New York Mets — the three teams with the highest payrolls, a combined $486 million — are watching the playoffs on television, while the Tampa Bay Rays, a franchise that uses a data-driven approach and has the second-lowest payroll in baseball at $44 million, are in the World Series (a sad reality for one of us).
Remarkably, a doctor today can get more data on the starting third baseman on his fantasy baseball team than on the effectiveness of life-and-death medical procedures. Studies have shown that most health care is not based on clinical studies of what works best and what does not — be it a test, treatment, drug or technology. Instead, most care is based on informed opinion, personal observation or tradition.
It is no surprise then that the United States spends more than twice as much per capita on health care compared to almost every other country in the world — and with worse health quality than most industrialized nations. Health premiums for a family of four have nearly doubled since 2001. Starbucks  pays more for health care than it does for coffee. Nearly 100,000 Americans are killed every year by preventable medical errors. We can do better if doctors have better access to concise, evidence-based medical information.
Look at what’s happened in baseball. For decades, executives, managers and scouts  built their teams and managed games based on their personal experiences and a handful of dubious statistics. This romantic approach has been replaced with a  statistics-based creed called sabermetrics.
These are not the stats we studied as children on the backs of baseball cards. Sabermetrics relies on obscure statistics like WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched), VORP (value over replacement player) or runs created  — a number derived from the formula [(hits + walks) x total bases]/(at bats + walks). Franchises have used this data to answer some of the key questions in baseball: When is an attempted steal worth the risk? Whom should we draft, and in what order? Should we re-sign an aging star player and run the risk of paying for past performance rather than future results?
Similarly, a health care system that is driven by robust comparative clinical evidence will save lives and money. One success story is Cochrane Collaboration, a nonprofit group that evaluates medical research. Cochrane performs systematic, evidence-based reviews of medical literature. In 1992, a Cochrane review found that many women at risk of premature delivery were not getting corticosteroids, which improve the lung function of premature babies.
Based on this evidence, the use of corticosteroids tripled. The result? A nearly 10 percentage point drop in the deaths of low-birth-weight babies  and millions of dollars in savings by avoiding the costs of treating complications.
Another example is Intermountain Healthcare, a nonprofit health-care system in Utah, where 80 percent of the care is based on evidence. Treatment data is collected by electronic medical records. The data is analyzed by researchers, and the best practices are then incorporated into the clinical process, resulting in far better quality care at a cost that is one-third less than the national average. (Disclosure: Intermountain Healthcare is a member of Mr. Gingrich’s organization.)
Evidence-based health care would not strip doctors of their decision-making authority nor replace their expertise. Instead, data and evidence should complement a lifetime of experience, so that doctors can deliver the best quality care at the lowest possible cost.
Working closely with doctors, the federal government and the private sector should create a new institute for evidence-based medicine. This institute would conduct new studies and systematically review the existing medical literature to help inform our nation’s over-stretched medical providers. The government should also increase  Medicare reimbursements and some liability protections for doctors who follow the recommended clinical best practices.
America’s health care system behaves like a hidebound, tradition-based ball club that chases after aging sluggers and plays by the old rules: we pay too much and get too little in return. To deliver better health care, we should learn from the successful teams that have adopted baseball’s new evidence-based methods. The best way to start improving quality and lowering costs is to study the stats.

In this election, Barack Obama and John McCain are offering starkly different ideas for how to fix that system.
There is no shortage of problems:
¶ Some 45 million Americans lack health insurance, limiting their ability to get timely care.
¶ The costs of medical care and health insurance are rising much faster than household incomes, making it increasingly difficult for people to afford either.
¶ People can’t carry their insurance from one job to another, limiting their mobility. Outside the workplace, it is hard to find affordable insurance.
¶ Despite the wealth and technological prowess of this country, the quality of medical care often lags behind that available in other industrialized nations.
Both candidates have largely accepted the prevailing expert wisdom on ways to improve quality and lower health care costs over the long run, such as relying more on electronic medical records and better management of the chronically ill. But they have very different ideas on the best way to make insurance available and affordable for all Americans.
We believe that Mr. McCain’s plan, which relies on reshaping the tax code, is far too risky. It is likely to erode employer-provided group health insurance and push more people into purchasing their own insurance on the dysfunctional open market, where insurers often reject applicants with pre-existing conditions.
Mr. Obama has focused primarily on extending coverage to a big chunk of the 45 million uninsured Americans by expanding existing private and public programs with the help of federal subsidies and mandates. His boldest innovation would be a new federally regulated exchange where Americans not covered at work would be able to choose — as federal employees currently can — among a variety of private group policies. He would also create a new public program to compete with the private insurers.
Mr. Obama’s plan is a better start than Mr. McCain’s. But it is still not likely to help all Americans who need and deserve affordable, high-quality medical care.
As voters weigh their choice for next Tuesday’s election, we offer this detailed review of the two candidates’ plans.
THE MCCAIN PROPOSAL Mr. McCain’s main idea is to change the tax code so that workers would have to pay income taxes on the value of their employer’s contribution to their health insurance. In return, all Americans, whether currently insured or not, would receive a tax credit of $2,500 for an individual or $5,000 for a family to buy health insurance, either through their employer or on the open market.
Mr. Obama has derided this plan as giving tax credits with one hand and taking them away with the other. But the tax credits are initially so generous that a great majority of workers would end up ahead: their tax credit would exceed the tax they would have to pay on their employer-provided insurance.
They could stay in the same health plan at work and have extra money that could be applied to other health care costs. Or they could buy policies in the open market. As good as that sounds, a $5,000 credit would not go very far toward buying a typical $12,000 family policy but might well suffice for the young and healthy, who get preferable rates.
Mr. McCain correctly recognizes that there are disadvantages to linking insurance to jobs — as thousands of laid-off American workers already are discovering — and that there is an intrinsic inequity in the current tax code that favors those who have employer plans over those buying individual coverage.
The great danger is that Mr. McCain’s plan will fragment the sharing of risks and costs — the bedrock of any good insurance plan — by enticing young, healthy workers to bail out of their employers’ group policies to seek cheaper insurance on their own. Their older or less healthy colleagues would be left behind, which would drive up premiums at work. The rising costs could lead many companies to drop their health coverage entirely.
The proposal also offers little protection for older and sicker people forced to buy policies in the open market. Mr. McCain says the federal government would help underwrite high-risk pools like those operated by many states to cover such patients. But the subsidies his aides have talked about — some $7 billion to $10 billion a year — would fall far short of the amount needed.
Mr. McCain would loosen state regulations on insurers by allowing companies to sell across state lines. Some states require insurers to accept all applicants and provide specified standard benefits, and they limit the ability of companies to base premiums on health status. In the name of promoting competition, Mr. McCain’s plan would free companies from those terms. Anyone who lost insurance as a result would have to seek coverage through the high-risk pools.
THE OBAMA PLAN Mr. Obama would do far more than his opponent to address the nation’s shameful failure to provide health coverage for all citizens. He would require all parents to get coverage for their children and expand Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. He would also require large and midsize companies to offer health insurance to their workers or pay into a kitty to subsidize coverage elsewhere — a provision that Senator McCain castigates as a “fine” but that really is their fair share of the burden.
Mr. Obama says the government would provide subsidies to encourage small employers to offer coverage and to help low-income people buy insurance. This is not a government-run program — as Mr. McCain claims — but it does give the government a much bigger role than it now has by expanding public programs and creating a new national plan.
Mr. Obama would also greatly increase government regulation of the insurance industry. He would require insurance companies to take every applicant and meet a minimum standard of benefits, and he would prevent them from charging higher premiums based on an applicant’s health. Some states have similar requirements now and insurance companies still sell policies there.
COVERAGE Some experts estimate that the McCain plan would reduce the number of uninsured only modestly because millions of people would drop or lose employer coverage, and not many more than that would buy policies outside of work. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the McCain plan would lower the number of uninsured by a mere two million in 2018, out of a projected 67 million uninsured in that year. The Obama plan would cut the number by 34 million, the center says, but still leave nearly 33 million uninsured.
The McCain campaign makes an optimistic prediction that up to 30 million of the uninsured might take out policies using their tax credits. If so, those policies would probably be meager — with high deductibles, large co-payments and limited benefits — and unlikely to provide much help in a crisis.
COSTS Despite all the Republican warnings about high-spending Democrats, McCain’s plan could be a lot more expensive than Mr. Obama’s, at least in the early years, and possibly in the long term. This is because the generous tax credits would drain federal revenues faster than the tax on employer policies would replenish them.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that the McCain plan would cost the federal government $1.3 trillion over 10 years, and the Obama plan $1.6 trillion. Using different assumptions, the Lewin Group, a consulting firm, estimates that the McCain plan would increase federal spending by $2.05 trillion over 10 years, compared with $1.17 trillion for the Obama package.
Neither candidate has persuasively explained how he would pay for his plan. Mr. Obama says he would apply the money saved by rescinding Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy and hoped-for savings from reforming the health care system, but there is considerable doubt those savings will materialize quickly.
Mr. McCain also counts on cost-containment measures but is mostly relying on market forces to reduce the cost of health insurance and health care. He expects that people who buy their own coverage will shop for cheaper policies and make more careful choices about what medical care they really need. Among the dangers is that chronically ill people may forgo needed treatments.
Mr. Obama’s plan is the better one because it would cover far more of the uninsured, spread risks and costs more equitably and result in more comprehensive coverage for most Americans. We fear Mr. McCain’s plan would jeopardize employer-based coverage without providing an adequate substitute. At a time when so many employers are reducing or dropping coverage, that is not a risk that the country can afford to take.

32,832,2008-11-30T00:00:00Z,article,Youâ€™re Leaving a Digital Trail. What About Privacy?,547aa3e438f0d803f445bde3,"subject:Privacy, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Wireless Communications, subject:Science and Technology",SundayBusiness,0.0,None,An emerging field called collective intelligence could create an Orwellian future on a level Big Brother could only dream of.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/business/30privacy.html,1946,An emerging field called collective intelligence could create an Orwellian future on a level Big Brother could only dream of.,"Cambridge, Mass.
HARRISON BROWN, an 18-year-old freshman majoring in mathematics at M.I.T., didn’t need to do complex calculations to figure out he liked this deal: in exchange for letting researchers track his every move, he receives a free smartphone.
Now, when he dials another student, researchers know. When he sends an e-mail or text message, they also know. When he listens to music, they know the song. Every moment he has his Windows Mobile smartphone with him, they know where he is, and who’s nearby.
Mr. Brown and about 100 other students living in Random Hall at M.I.T. have agreed to swap their privacy for smartphones that generate digital trails to be beamed to a central computer. Beyond individual actions, the devices capture a moving picture of the dorm’s social network.
The students’ data is but a bubble in a vast sea of digital information being recorded by an ever thicker web of sensors, from phones to GPS units to the tags in office ID badges, that capture our movements and interactions. Coupled with information already gathered from sources like Web surfing and credit cards, the data is the basis for an emerging field called collective intelligence.
Propelled by new technologies and the Internet’s steady incursion into every nook and cranny of life, collective intelligence offers powerful capabilities, from improving the efficiency of advertising to giving community groups new ways to organize.
But even its practitioners acknowledge that, if misused, collective intelligence tools could create an Orwellian future on a level Big Brother could only dream of.
Collective intelligence could make it possible for insurance companies, for example, to use behavioral data to covertly identify people suffering from a particular disease and deny them insurance coverage. Similarly, the government or law enforcement agencies could  identify members of a protest group by tracking social networks revealed by the new technology. “There are so many uses for this technology — from marketing to war fighting — that I can’t imagine it not pervading our lives in just the next few years,” says Steve Steinberg, a computer scientist who works for an investment firm in New York.
In a widely read Web posting, he argued that there were significant chances that it would be misused,  “This is one of the most significant technology trends I have seen in years; it may also be one of the most pernicious.”
For the last 50 years, Americans have worried about the privacy of the individual in the computer age. But new technologies have become so powerful that protecting individual privacy may no longer be the only issue. Now, with the Internet, wireless sensors, and the capability to analyze an avalanche of data, a person’s profile can be drawn  without monitoring him or her directly.
“Some have argued that with new technology there is a diminished expectation of privacy,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group in Washington. “But the opposite may also be true. New techniques may require us to expand our understanding of privacy and to address the impact that data collection has on groups of individuals and not simply a single person.”
Mr. Brown, for one, isn’t concerned about losing his privacy. The M.I.T researchers have convinced him that they have gone to great lengths to protect any information generated by the experiment that would reveal his identity.
Besides, he says, “the way I see it, we all have Facebook pages, we all have e-mail and Web sites and blogs.”
“This is a drop in the bucket in terms of privacy,” he adds.
GOOGLE and its vast farm of more than a million search engine servers spread around the globe remain the best example of the power and wealth-building potential of collective intelligence. Google’s fabled PageRank algorithm, which was originally responsible for the quality of Google’s search results, drew its precision from the inherent wisdom in the billions of individual Web links that people create.
The company introduced a speech-recognition service in early November, initially for the Apple  iPhone, that gains its accuracy in large part from a statistical model built from several trillion search terms that its users have entered in the last decade. In the future, Google will take advantage of spoken queries to predict even more accurately the questions its users will ask.
And, a few weeks ago, Google deployed an early-warning service for spotting flu trends, based on search queries for flu-related symptoms.
The success of Google, along with the rapid spread of the wireless Internet and sensors  — like location trackers in cellphones and GPS units in cars —  has touched off a race to cash in on collective intelligence technologies.
In 2006, Sense Networks, based in New York, proved that there was a wealth of useful information hidden in a digital archive of GPS data generated by tens of thousands of taxi rides in San Francisco. It could see, for example, that people who worked in the city’s financial district would tend to go to work early when the market was booming, but later when it was down.
It also noticed that middle-income people — as determined by ZIP code data — tended to order cabs more often just before market downturns.
Sense has developed two applications, one for consumers to use on smartphones like the BlackBerry and the iPhone, and the other for companies interested in forecasting social trends and financial behavior. The consumer application, Citysense, identifies entertainment hot spots in a city. It connects  information from Yelp and Google about nightclubs and music clubs with data generated by tracking  locations of anonymous cellphone users.
The second application,  Macrosense, is intended to give businesses insight into human activities. It  uses a vast database that merges GPS, Wi-Fi positioning, cell-tower triangulation, radio frequency identification chips and other sensors.
“There is a whole new set of metrics that no one has ever measured,” said Greg Skibiski, chief executive of Sense. “We were able to look at people moving around stores” and other locations. Such travel patterns, coupled with data on incomes, can give retailers early insights into sales levels and who is shopping at competitors’ stores.
Alex Pentland, a professor at the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is leading the dormitory research project, was a co-founder of Sense Networks. He is part of a new generation of researchers who have relatively effortless access to data that in the past was either painstakingly assembled by hand or acquired from questionnaires or interviews that relied on the memories and honesty of the subjects.
The Media Lab researchers have worked with Hitachi Data Systems, the Japanese technology company, to use some of the lab’s technologies to improve businesses’ efficiency. For example, by equipping employees with sensor badges that generate the same kinds of data provided by the students’ smartphones, the researchers determined that face-to-face communication was far more important to  an organization’s work than was generally believed.
Productivity improved 30 percent with an incremental increase in face-to-face communication, Dr. Pentland said. The results were so promising that Hitachi has established a consulting business that overhauls organizations via the researchers’ techniques.
Dr. Pentland calls his research “reality mining” to differentiate it from an earlier generation of data mining conducted through more traditional methods.
Dr. Pentland “is the emperor of networked sensor research,” said Michael Macy, a sociologist at Cornell who studies communications networks and their role as social networks. People and organizations, he said,  are increasingly choosing to interact with one another through digital means that record traces of those interactions. “This allows scientists to study those interactions in ways that five years ago we never would have thought we could do,” he said.
ONCE based on networked personal computers, collective intelligence systems are increasingly being created to leverage wireless networks of digital sensors and smartphones. In one application, groups of scientists and political and environmental activists are developing “participatory sensing” networks.
At the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing at the University of California, Los Angeles,  for example, researchers are developing a Web service they call a Personal Environmental Impact Report to build a community map of air quality in Los Angeles. It is intended to let people assess how their activities affect the environment and to make decisions about their health. Users may decide to change their jogging route,  or run at a different time of day, depending on air quality at the time.
“Our mantra is to make it possible to observe what was previously unobservable,” said Deborah Estrin,  director of the center and a computer scientist at U.C.L.A.
But Dr. Estrin said the project still faced a host of challenges, both with the accuracy of tiny sensors  and with the researchers’ ability  to be certain that  personal information remains private. She is skeptical about technical efforts to obscure the identity of individual contributors to databases of information collected by network sensors.
Attempts to blur the identity of individuals have only a limited capability, she said. The researchers encrypt the data to protect against identifying particular people, but that has limits.
“Even though we are protecting the information, it is still subject to subpoena and subject to bullying bosses or spouses,” she said.
She says that there may still be  ways to protect privacy. “I can imagine a system where the data will disappear,” she said.
Already, activist groups have seized on the technology to improve the effectiveness of their organizing.  A service called MobileActive helps nonprofit organizations around the world use mobile phones to harness the expertise and the energy of their participants, by sending out action alerts, for instance.
Pachube (pronounced “PATCH-bay”) is a Web service that lets people share real-time sensor data from anywhere in the world. With Pachube, one can combine and display sensor data, from the cost of energy in one location, to temperature and pollution monitoring, to data flowing from a buoy off the coast of Charleston, S.C., all creating an information-laden snapshot of the world.
Such a complete and constantly updated picture will undoubtedly redefine traditional notions of privacy.
DR. PENTLAND says there are ways to avoid  surveillance-society pitfalls that lurk in the technology. For the commercial use of such information, he has proposed a set of principles derived from English common law to guarantee that people have ownership rights to  data about  their behavior. The idea revolves around three principles: that you have a right to possess your own data, that you control the data that is collected about you, and that you can destroy, remove or redeploy your data as you wish.
At the same time, he argued that individual privacy rights must also be weighed against the public good.
Citing the epidemic involving severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in recent years, he said technology would have helped health officials watch the movement of infected people as it happened, providing an opportunity to limit the spread of the disease.
“If I could have looked at the cellphone records, it could have been stopped that morning rather than a couple of weeks later,” he said. “I’m sorry, that trumps minute concerns about privacy.”
Indeed, some collective-intelligence researchers argue that strong concerns about privacy rights are a relatively recent phenomenon in human history.
“The new information tools symbolized by the Internet are radically changing the possibility of how we can organize large-scale human efforts,” said Thomas W. Malone, director of the M.I.T. Center for Collective Intelligence.
“For most of human history, people have lived in small tribes where everything they did was known by everyone they knew,” Dr. Malone said. “In some sense we’re becoming a global village. Privacy may turn out to have become an anomaly.”

The budget office, an influential voice in the work of Congress, analyzed 115 options, including proposals to expand coverage and slow the growth of health spending.
Some of the options, including proposals to increase taxes on cigarettes and nondiet soft drinks, are sure to meet stiff political opposition.
One bright spot in a generally bleak picture was the estimate of potential savings from a requirement for doctors and hospitals to use health information technology, including electronic medical records, as a condition of participating in Medicare.
Such a requirement could save the federal government $7 billion in the first five years and a total of $34 billion over 10 years, by reducing medical errors and avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures, the budget office said. It “would also lower health insurance premiums in the private sector,” the report said.
Without action by Congress, the report said, health costs will continue to soar, the number of people without insurance will rise by nearly one million a year, to a total of 54 million in 2019, and spending on health care will increase to 25 percent of the gross domestic product in 2025, up from 16 percent in 2007.
In keeping with its duty to provide objective, impartial analysis, the budget office did not endorse any options, but it fleshed out many ideas circulating on Capitol Hill.
Democrats and many Republicans say they will make a serious effort to overhaul the health care system in 2009. Those changes are essential for economic recovery, they say.
But Mr. Obama and other Democrats have not been precise about the cost of their proposals, nor have they said in detail how they would pay for them.  One of the Democrats’ favorite proposals, rolling back tax cuts for high-income people, is already scheduled to occur in 2011, so, under the bookkeeping rules used by Congress, it would not produce a windfall of new revenue.
Lawmakers from both parties said they would pay close attention to the cost of new federal subsidies for health coverage because these subsidies — unlike the one-time bailouts for banks and other financial institutions — would be recurring federal obligations for years to come.
Requiring employers to provide health insurance to their employees or pay a fee to the federal government would bring in $47 billion of new federal revenue in the next 10 years, the report said.
A proposal to establish a national insurance pool for people who cannot obtain coverage on their own in the individual market would cost $16 billion in the next decade, it said.
Mr. Obama and many other Democrats want the government to negotiate with drug manufacturers to get lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries.
The Congressional Budget Office said such negotiations “would produce small if any savings” because the government would not have enough leverage to secure significant discounts beyond those already obtained by private insurance companies that manage the Medicare drug benefit.
But the budget office said Medicare could save $110 billion in the next 10 years if Congress simply imposed a form of price controls, requiring drug makers to provide the government with a 15 percent rebate, or discount, on brand-name drugs covered by the new Part D of Medicare.
Eliminating a notorious gap in Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, known as a doughnut hole, would cost more than $130 billion over 10 years, the report said.
Research to compare the effectiveness of different drugs and treatments might help doctors and patients make better decisions.
But it would not save the government much — $1.3 billion in the next decade — and it would reduce total spending on health care in those years by less than one-tenth of 1 percent, the budget office said.
The federal government could save $12 billion in the next decade if it established a procedure for approval of generic versions of expensive biotechnology drugs, the report said. It did not estimate the additional savings for consumers and employers, which could be substantial.
The report sets forth an elaborate proposal that would allow doctors and hospitals to share in the savings if they improve the quality and reduce the cost of care for people on Medicare.
Under the proposal, Medicare would pay bonuses to groups of doctors who met certain performance measures.
In response to such financial incentives, the report said, doctors would become more efficient and would reduce “the volume and intensity of services provided to their patients,” saving $5 billion for Medicare in the next decade.
In one particularly sobering chapter, the report notes that, under existing law, Medicare will cut fees paid to doctors by 21 percent in 2010 and by about 5 percent in each of the next few years.
To avoid such cuts and freeze payment rates at their 2009 levels would cost the government $318 billion over the next decade, the report said.

34,827,2008-12-27T00:00:00Z,article,Health Care That Puts a Computer on the Team,5475e57238f0d8119c6b0351,"subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Hospitals",Business,0.0,None,There is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age is essential to improving care and curbing costs.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/business/27record.html,2202,There is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age is essential to improving care and curbing costs.,"MARSHFIELD, Wis. — Joseph Calderaro, 67, is one of health care’s quiet success stories. Over the last four years, he has carefully managed his diabetes by lowering his blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol with diet, exercise and medication.
To keep on track, Mr. Calderaro visits his doctor, attends meetings for diabetes patients and gets frequent calls from a health counselor. It is a team effort, orchestrated by the Marshfield Clinic here. And it is animated by technology, starting with Mr. Calderaro’s computerized patient record — a continuously updated document that includes his health history, medications, lab tests, treatment guidelines and doctors’ and nurses’ notes.
To visit the Marshfield Clinic, a longtime innovator in health information technology, is to glimpse medicine’s digital future. Across the national spectrum of health care politics there is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age, the way Marshfield and some other health systems have already done, is essential to improving care and curbing costs.
A paper record is a passive, historical document. An electronic health record can be a vibrant tool that reminds and advises doctors.  It can hold information on a patient’s visits, treatments and conditions, going back years, even decades. It can be summoned with a mouse click, not hidden in a file drawer in a remote location and thus useless in medical emergencies.
Modern computerized systems have links to online information on best practices, treatment recommendations and harmful drug interactions. The potential benefits include fewer unnecessary tests, reduced medical errors and better care so patients are less likely to require costly treatment in hospitals.
The widespread adoption of electronic health records  might also greatly increase evidence-based medicine.  Each patient’s records add to a real-time, ever-growing database of evidence showing what works and what does not. The goal is to harness health information from individuals and populations, share it across networks, sift it and analyze it to make the practice of medicine more of a science and less an art.
The Bush administration has left it mainly to advocacy and the private sector to introduce digital medicine. But President-elect Barack Obama apparently plans to make a sizable government commitment. During the campaign, Mr. Obama vowed to spend $50 billion over five years to spur the adoption of electronic health records and said recently that a program to accelerate their use would be part of his stimulus package.
The Marshfield Clinic, a large doctors’ group in Wisconsin, shows that computerized records can indeed improve the quality and efficiency of medicine. Yet the Marshfield experience suggests that the digital record becomes truly useful only when patient information is mined to find patterns and answer questions: What treatments work best for particular categories of patients? What practices or procedures yield the best outcome?
The Marshfield Clinic “understands that it’s a system of improvement that technology makes possible that really matters, and the electronic health record itself is no silver bullet,” said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, director of the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
For the Obama presidency and the administrations that follow it, the challenge will be to somehow link electronic medical islands into a network that begins to approach on a national scale what organizations like Marshfield have achieved regionally. Ideally, a lone physician in a rural community could tap into the national health information network and be as well informed on treatments and research for patients with certain conditions as a specialist at Marshfield.
Some experts caution that such a broad capacity for record-sharing could take decades to achieve — if it is even possible in the decentralized American marketplace of medical competitors.
Marshfield Clinic, a nonprofit organization founded in 1916, has a long history of using information technology to further research and improve care. In the 1960s, the clinic bought the digital breakthrough of its day — a mainframe computer — and used punched cards to feed it information on diagnoses and procedures. In 1985, the clinic introduced its first basic electronic health records, kept refining them and by 1994 mandated that its doctors all use them. In 2003, it introduced wireless tablet computers, whose screen can written on like digital paper or flipped up, exposing a keyboard, and used as a conventional laptop PC.
Today, Marshfield’s 790 doctors and their support staff at 43 locations in Wisconsin all use the tablet PCs. At the end of last year, the group eliminated paper charts for the more than 365,000 patients its doctors see each year, freeing up storage space the size of a football field at the main clinic in Marshfield. At each step toward a fully digital system, physicians were consulted and involved in the design process.
“It’s been a fabulous journey from physicians being reluctant to now being unable to live without this technology,” observed Dr. Karl J. Ulrich, the clinic’s chief executive. Marshfield is one of a few dozen medical groups across the country that are aggressively embracing information technology. The organizations tend to be big — ranging from providers with thousands of physicians like Kaiser Permanente and the Department of Veterans Affairs to ones with hundreds like Marshfield and Geisinger Health Systems in central Pennsylvania. They are typically responsible for most or all aspects of a patient’s care. They are often insurers, as well.
Those groups, in other words, have the scale and economic incentives to invest in information technology to capture the gains from improved quality and efficiency. In that regard, they lie outside the mainstream of America’s health care economy, a fee-for-service system in which providers are typically paid for doing more, not necessarily doing better. It is a system that encourages more doctor visits, more tests, more surgical procedures, more pills.
For most doctors, who work in small practices, an investment in electronic health records looks simply like a cost for which they will not be reimbursed. That is why policy experts say any government financial incentives to use electronic records — matching grants or other subsidies — should be focused on practices with 10 or fewer doctors, which still account for three-fourths of all doctors in this country. Only about 17 percent of the nation’s physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Even for the large doctor groups, there is no crisp, conclusive cost-benefit arithmetic. Marshfield can point to various measurable savings, but has scant proof they outweigh the millions spent in the past and the $50 million-a-year technology budget.
“People ask about return on investment, but that’s the wrong question,” said Dr. John W. Melski, the medical director of clinical informatics at Marshfield. “This requires the usual leap of faith that knowledge will yield good things — better care, doing things smarter and, yes, saving money in the long run.”
Aided by their growing database, Marshfield’s physician-researchers are working on ambitious projects in personalized medicine that use genetic markers to tailor drug dosages. For example, the clinic recently began a clinical test on 250 patients that uses three gene markers to personalize their doses of Coumadin, or warfarin as the generic drug is known. The blood-thinning drug is widely prescribed for heart patients. But it is often difficult to calibrate the right dose for individuals, and the consequences of internal bleeding or blood clots can be life-threatening.  In this case, the electronic health record is the starting point for research, feeding information into the database from which the clinic’s scientists appropriate patients. The digital record holds the patient-specific information used in the Coumadin calculation of tailored doses for individuals.
Marshfield is also researching “predictive” medicine that combines genetics, family histories and lab tests to warn patients  about looming health risks. It has a voluntary DNA database on nearly 20,000 people, whose health care information goes back 30 years on average — and the electronic record is the vehicle for collecting and conveying that information. The researchers are looking for patterns in family history, lifestyle, environmental factors, lab test results and selected genetic markers that might predict the onset of conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease years in advance.
“Better health information technology is needed every step of the way,” said Catherine A. McCarty, director of Marshfield’s center for human genetics and principal investigator for its personalized medicine research project. “We could not do this without the electronic health record.”
The more immediate target, though, is harnessing the digital technology to help manage chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, cancer and asthma.  Seventy-five percent of America’s health care spending goes to people with one or more chronic conditions. And as the population ages that percentage is rising.
Marshfield’s progress in recent years with its more than 18,000 diabetes patients, including Mr. Calderaro, points to the potential. The gains are a byproduct of being able to constantly measure and manage health outcomes, a process of efficiently gathering and monitoring patient information that is made possible by the electronic health record. Besides the doctor visits, group meetings and monthly calls from a diabetes counselor, Mr. Calderaro has used all the information to take responsibility for controlling his diabetes. He not only monitors his blood sugar and blood pressure readings, but he could recite the carbohydrate grams in each of the foods he ate one day recently. A three-mile walk is often part of his daily regimen. He was never really heavy, but he has a sister with diabetes and had a maternal grandmother who suffered from the disease.
“If I had known when I was 40 years old what I know now, I would have done things differently,” Mr. Calderaro said.
From mid-2004 through the third quarter of this year, the percentage of the clinic’s diabetic patients with blood cholesterol at or below the recommended level rose to 61 percent, from 40 percent earlier. The percentage with satisfactory blood pressure increased to 52 percent, up from 32 percent.
Over the same span, hospital admissions among Marshfield’s diabetic population fell — to 311 per 1,000 patients a year, from 360. Because a hospital stay for a diabetes patient ranges from $8,000 to $22,500, according to national statistics, Marshfield’s results translate into an annual cost saving of $7.3 million to $20.5 million.
More important may be the suffering avoided. Complications from diabetes include kidney failure, blindness and amputations. “Those are the things that really scare you,” Mr. Calderaro, the patient, said. “But it doesn’t have to be. You can manage it.”
Marshfield is striving to help more of its diabetes patients to do as well as Mr. Calderaro, and the federal Medicare agency has recognized Marshfield’s progress.
In a continuing pilot project, Medicare has selected the clinic and nine other large doctor groups and arranged to pay them for the quality of care they deliver. Last year, on the basis of how well diabetes patients had fared, by various measures, Marshfield was one of only two groups that did well enough to earn bonus payments.
The Medicare pilot prompted Marshfield to take a fresh look at how it cares for various chronic conditions, including heart disease and hypertension. That led to a new software tool, called the iList, which has proved a big help, said Dr. Theodore A. Praxel, Marshfield’s medical director of quality improvement and care management.
The iList (for “intervention list”) culls the patient records of a primary care physician, and ranks and flags patients by conditions not met, including uncontrolled blood pressure and cholesterol, overdue lab tests and vaccinations missed. Nurses and medical assistants then “work the iList,” calling patients with reminders and scheduling them for exams and lab work.
In medicine, the computer is to memory what the X-ray machine is to vision — a technology that vastly surpasses human limitations. The benefits of a computer-helper, doctors say, become quickly evident in everyday practice.
When a doctor electronically prescribes a new drug, for example, an on-screen warning appears if the medication is on the patient’s allergy list or could cause a potentially dangerous interaction with another drug the person is taking. In the New England Journal of Medicine survey, 71 percent of physicians using electronic health records with that feature said they had received a computer alert that helped them avoid a harmful prescription mistake.
“It absolutely happens,” said Dr. Edna O. DeVries, a pediatrician at Marshfield. “You’re distracted and talking to the parents. You’re on autopilot.”
Dr. DeVries, who joined the clinic in 1989,  was the medical director nearly a decade ago on a database, created by Marshfield, to track early childhood immunizations in central Wisconsin. Over the next two years, the immunization rates for children in the area rose to 93 percent, from 67 percent, as a result of the tracking and follow-up reminders.
“The quality of care goes up dramatically just by having information instantly,” Dr. DeVries said. Yet, as her colleague and veteran of computer medicine Dr. Melski notes, there is no payoff to technology alone — only in people using technology wisely.
“We have to restructure our medical culture,” he said. “We have to promote a culture that believes in the evidence and is trained in analyzing the evidence. It’s the only long-run answer to the challenges we face in health care — evidence-based medicine.”

HEALTH care drained the federal budget of more than $1 trillion this year. That includes direct health care programs like Medicare, plus insurance for federal employees and the cost of excluding employer health-care contributions from workers’ taxable incomes. If present trends continue, in 10 years the number will almost double.
President-elect Barack Obama has proposed some good ideas for cutting health care costs, but his proposals will not create the savings we need.
He has suggested, for example, that electronic medical records could save Americans nearly $80 billion per year. But information technology cannot bring meaningful savings if it is used in a health care system that regularly rewards waste and punishes efficiency, as ours does.
Similarly, Mr. Obama proposes to save more than $80 billion per year by better management of chronic conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and asthma, and by preventing more diseases in the first place. It is true that most American doctors are weak on prevention and chronic disease management. But they will not improve until they are given economic incentives to buy the equipment and hire the personnel they need to actually deliver these services.
The only truly promising way to save money is to change the way health care is organized and delivered. In the United States, 85 percent of doctors work in small, fee-for-service practices. Many of these doctors are very good and hard-working. But they are autonomous, not members of teams. They do not systematically share information with one another. They are unable and unwilling to be held accountable for the quality and cost of the care they deliver.
The employment-based health insurance system has created this situation by not encouraging people to consider the value for their money when they choose doctors.
Some American medical practices do emphasize economy. They are very large, multispecialty group practices in which doctors work together to improve quality and keep costs low. Their doctors share values and cultures of teamwork. They keep comprehensive electronic medical records, they share information, and they emphasize disease prevention and chronic disease management as a matter of course.
These doctors are usually paid salaries, not fees for services. Research and experience suggests that these practices — which exist in all regions of the country, including both rural and urban communities — can reduce costs by 30 percent.
And a few employers — some universities and companies, the federal government, the state governments in Wisconsin and California — allow their workers to choose such practices, and then keep the money saved by that choice. At least 70 percent of employees offered this option choose it, even when it involves restrictions on doctor selection.
Unless all Americans are given this choice — along with the right to keep the savings — we will not be able to get health care costs under control. But making this change won’t be easy. Employers and insurance companies are likely to resist it. Doctors and consumers will have to change. It will take time.
Right now, most employers offer workers no choice of insurance companies. They say it would be too expensive to administer more than one. And insurance companies offer employers better deals when they can be the sole supplier.
Even at companies where employees have choices, many employers pay 80 percent to 100 percent of the premiums of an employee’s chosen plan, so there is little opportunity for the employee to realize savings. This market does not reward cost-conscious behavior. The tax code makes this problem worse by exempting employer contributions to health insurance from taxes, no matter how large they are.
Efficient, organized medical systems need to be able to compete with — and ultimately replace — the fee-for-service model. Working with Congress, the next president should establish a national health-insurance exchange, through which people can choose among several competing health plans, including those affiliated with organized systems of care. Individuals could then select which plan they judge best to meet their needs, and save money by choosing less expensive options. The insurers in the exchange would agree to accept all who want to enroll, and to charge their same price to all individuals, no matter the state of their health.
Then, to ensure that enough people participate in the health-insurance exchange, Mr. Obama and Congress should phase in a requirement that the tax-free status of employer contributions to health care be dependent on employers buying health care for their workers through the exchange — and making fixed-dollar contributions, so workers can reap the savings when they choose less expensive plans. All employees would have a wide range of choices, with an incentive to be cost-conscious. (Eventually, the government should help everyone buy insurance through the exchange, regardless of employment.)
Right now, Mr. Obama’s plan is to create an exchange through which people who have difficulty buying affordable health insurance could buy coverage. Unfortunately, participation in exchanges cannot be voluntary. Voluntary exchanges have been tried and failed. The first people to join are the sickest, which drives up the premiums.
To make exchanges work, a broad sample of people, healthy and sick, must be included so that health risks can be spread widely. Large exchanges would also lower the administrative costs for insurers.
By combining organized systems of medical care with the competition created by a health insurance exchange, Mr. Obama could achieve large savings. In 10 years, costs could be reduced by 30 percent, saving more than $700 billion a year — all driven by incentives and voluntary actions.

Lawmakers, caught in a crossfire of lobbying by the health care industry and consumer groups, have been unable to agree on privacy safeguards that would allow patients to control the use of their medical records.
Congressional leaders plan to provide $20 billion for such technology in an economic stimulus bill whose cost could top $825 billion.
In a speech outlining his economic recovery plan, Mr. Obama said, “We will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years all of America’s medical records are computerized.” Digital medical records could prevent medical errors, save lives and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, Mr. Obama has said.
So far, the only jobs created have been for a small army of lobbyists trying to secure money for health information technology. They say doctors, hospitals, drugstores and insurance companies would be much more efficient if they could exchange data instantaneously through electronic health information networks. Consumer groups and some members of Congress insist that the new spending must be accompanied by stronger privacy protections in an era when digital data can be sent around the world or posted on the Web with the click of a mouse.
Lawmakers leading the campaign for such safeguards include Representatives Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Pete Stark of California, both Democrats; Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.
Without strong safeguards, Mr. Markey said, the dream of electronic health information networks could turn into “a nightmare for consumers.”
In the last few years, personal health information on hundreds of thousands of people has been compromised because of security lapses at hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. These breaches occurred despite federal privacy rules issued under a 1996 law. Congress is trying to strengthen those privacy protections and make sure they apply to computer records. Lobbyists for insurers, drug benefit managers and others in the health industry are mobilizing a campaign to persuade Congress that overly stringent privacy protections would frustrate the potential benefits of digital records.
One of the proposed safeguards would outlaw the sale of any personal health information in an electronic medical record, except with the patient’s permission.
Another would allow patients to impose additional controls on certain particularly sensitive information, like records of psychotherapy, abortions and tests for the virus that causes AIDS. Patients could demand that such information be segregated from the rest of their medical records.
Under other proposals being seriously considered in Congress, health care providers and insurers would have to use encryption technology to protect personal health information stored in or sent by computers. Patients would have a right to an accounting of any disclosures of their electronic data. Health care providers and insurers would have to notify patients whenever such information was lost, stolen or used for an unauthorized purpose. And patients — or state officials acting on their behalf — could recover damages from an entity that improperly used or disclosed personal health information.
Rahm Emanuel, who will be the White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, advocated such safeguards when he was a House member from Illinois. “As we move forward on health information technology,” Mr. Emanuel said, “it is absolutely essential that an individual’s most personal and vulnerable information is protected.”
Advisers to Mr. Obama say he favors strong privacy protections but does not want the dispute to slow down the bill.
Mary R. Grealy, president of the Health Care Leadership Council, which represents large health care corporations, said the proposed safeguards could be an impediment to the widespread adoption of health information technology and counteract any economic stimulus effect.
In a letter to Congressional leaders, Karen M. Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, expressed “serious concern about privacy provisions being considered for inclusion in the economic stimulus bill.”
She criticized, in particular, a proposal that would require health care providers to obtain the consent of patients before disclosing personal health information for treatment, payment or “health care operations.”
Such a requirement, she said, could cripple efforts to manage chronic diseases like diabetes, which often require coordination of care among many specialists.
At the moment, senior House Democrats are determined to include privacy safeguards in the economic recovery bill. But some insurance lobbyists said they hoped Congress would punt on the issue, leaving privacy standards to be developed by the Health and Human Services Department, where they believe they can make their case more effectively. Microsoft has joined many consumer groups in supporting stronger safeguards. The software giant has developed products that allow consumers and providers to store and share medical data in a secure format.
“Health information technology will succeed only if privacy is protected,” said Frank C. Torres, director of consumer affairs at Microsoft. “For the president-elect to achieve his vision, he has to protect privacy.”
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Peter R. Orszag, director-designate of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said electronic medical records could be more secure than paper records.
“If the files are electronic,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “computers can record every time someone has access to your medical information.” But, he said, the challenge is political as well as technical.
“Until people are more confident about the security of electronic medical records,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “it’s vitally important that we err on the side of privacy.”
The data in medical records has great potential commercial value. Several companies, for example, buy and sell huge amounts of data on the prescribing habits of doctors, and the information has proved invaluable to pharmaceutical sales representatives.
“Health I.T. without privacy is an excellent way for companies to establish a gold mine of information that can be used to increase profits, promote expensive drugs, cherry-pick patients who are cheaper to insure and market directly to consumers,” said Dr. Deborah C. Peel, coordinator of the Coalition for Patient Privacy, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union among its members.

Martensen has treated an estimated 75,000 patients and says the health care crisis is one of money, people and systems.","Over a long medical career, Dr. Robert L. Martensen, 62, has been an emergency room and intensive care unit physician, treating an estimated 75,000 patients. He has taught bioethics and medical history at Harvard Medical School and Tulane University in New Orleans. After Hurricane Katrina wiped out his home and Tulane professorship, Dr. Martensen moved to Bethesda, Md., to direct the National Institutes of Health Office of History. Recently, Farrar, Straus & Giroux published Dr. Martensen’s critique of the American health care system, “A Life Worth Living: A Doctor’s Reflections on Illness in a High-Tech Era.” We spoke in New York City during his book tour and later on the telephone. An edited version of the conversations follows.
Q. THE KEYSTONE OF PRESIDENT-ELECT BARACK OBAMA’S HEALTH CARE PLATFORM INVOLVES SETTING UP A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL RECORDS. WILL THAT SOLVE OUR HEALTH CARE PROBLEM?
A. Shared electronic records are valuable. They will reduce error. It may save money because it could cut down on duplicate testing. But the health care crisis is of much greater magnitude than that.
In addition to all the issues around health insurance and who pays, we have a system that costs more than any in the world and where almost everyone is unhappy. Patients feel, “Nobody is listening to me.” Hospital administrators are unhappy because the bottom line has become paramount and their mission has gotten lost. The heads of the large professional organizations feel there is no center anymore; it’s just atomized interest groups, hustling and scrambling. Physicians are disgruntled by their inability to practice the way they’d like. Many are quitting.
This is nothing that technology will fix. The problem is money, people and systems. It’s not that electronic records aren’t worth doing. But to present this as the solution is inadequate.
Q. In your book, you particularly criticize the American way of dying. Why do you feel that this aspect of health care is on the wrong track?
A. Most Americans die in hospitals or nursing homes, and neither is configured to take care of dying patients. There’s little palliative care available, and often the payment structure of health insurance doesn’t support it.
So you end up with situations where a 90-year-old with organ failure is brought to an emergency room and the doctors go, “Let’s tune her up.” Or if the patient starts failing at the nursing home, they’ll say: “No one dies here. Let’s get her to the emergency room.” It’s not unusual in the last six months of a patient’s life that they’ll be shuttled between the nursing home and hospital 6, 8, 10 times and subjected to a lot of painful and expensive interventions. The patient is artificially maintained that way until their body gives out.
I’ve done ethics consults for hospitals where patients have been in the I.C.U. for six months. An elderly woman has gone from a serious neurological problem to end-stage renal disease, with no hope of ever being able to move a finger and no one told the family, “Your mom is dying.” When it was finally said, the relatives were furious.
Q. WHAT SHOULD DOCTORS SAY INSTEAD?
A. I think doctors should get comfortable with being realistic. If it is the case, the doctor should bring up the idea that this disease process might be fatal. Right now, we say, “I can’t take away a person’s hope,” as if doctors were bestowing life. You have to support those hopes that are realistic, not this fantasy land.
I’ve seen how a lot of these interventions are inhumane. If you resuscitate an older person, you may break their ribs during C.P.R. If you put them on a ventilator, you may end up sedating them so heavily they are barely conscious.
Q. CAN THERE BE SUCH A THING AS A GOOD DEATH? 
A. My father had one. He was a systems engineer. In his 80s, he developed serious pulmonary problems, and he was very savvy about how things can go wrong in complicated systems, which hospitals are. To make sure that nothing was done to him that only technically extended his life, he made sure that his wife, doctor and hospital had copies of his medical directives. He didn’t have an extended period of dying because he avoided being put on a ventilator. My father died comfortable, surrounded by people who loved him. He was lucid till about five minutes before his death.
I think that’s what I’d want for myself, too. It’s not easy to get. I’ve seen situations where people leave specific directives and the hospitals still resuscitate them.
Q. For many years you worked as an emergency room physician. Why that specialty?
A. An emergency room is where the rubber meets the road in medicine. In terms of the arrays of things you see, every shift is different. I like that. I like doing general care, with the spice aspect. I like making diagnoses.
I had a patient one time: he was 19, from Bangladesh. He had high fever and lumps under his armpit. I had just been reading Daniel Defoe’s “Journal of the Plague Year,” where Defoe described patients with buboes, these walnut-sized lesions from the plague. And that’s what flashed through my mind when I saw this ashen kid. He had bubonic plague, it turned out.
Q. Is the lesson of this story that doctors, as part of their training, should read more history and literature?
A. It would be of immediate benefit. If I hadn’t read Defoe around that time, I might have misdiagnosed my patient, given him antibiotics and sent him home, which was a homeless shelter. The infection could have spread quickly.
Actually, a lot of E.R. doctors have nonmedical interests. It’s a specialty that while you’re doing it, you’re fully present. When your shift is done, you leave it behind. A surprising number of emergency room physicians are artists, even writers.
Q. Do you still practice?
A. No. Six years ago, I was working at a hospital in the Middle West. The other hospital in the region had shut down, and we were the hospital of last resort, seeing double the patients. I was responsible for 60 in eight hours — people with gunshot wounds, heart attacks, children with meningitis. Conditions made it impossible to practice good medicine. I felt like I was skating on thin ice. I just wanted out. My story is not unique. But I miss patients. I miss the E.R.

The goal is both to improve the quality and lower the costs of care by replacing cumbersome paper records with electronic records that can be easily stored and swiftly transmitted.
The idea is sound, but it also raises important questions about how to ensure the privacy of patients. Fortunately, the legislation would impose sensible privacy protections despite attempts by business lobbyists to weaken the safeguards.
With paper records the opportunities for breaches are limited to over-the-shoulder glimpses or the occasional lost or stolen files. But when records are kept and transferred electronically, the potential for abuse can become as vast as the Internet.
Electronic health records that can be linked to individual patients are already protected by laws that apply primarily to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacists, laboratories and insurance plans. The stimulus bill that has passed in the House, and a similar bill awaiting approval in the Senate, would strengthen the privacy requirements and apply them more directly to “business associates” of the providers, like billing and collection services or pharmacy benefit managers, that have access to sensitive data but are not readily held accountable for any misuse.
The potential for harm was spelled out by the American Civil Liberties Union in a recent letter to Congress. Employers who obtain medical records inappropriately might reject a job candidate who looks expensive to insure. Drug companies with access to pharmaceutical records might try to pressure patients to switch to their products. Data brokers might buy medical and pharmaceutical records and sell them to marketers. Unscrupulous employees with access to electronic records might snoop on the health of their colleagues or neighbors.
The bills pending in Congress would go a long way toward preventing such abuses. They would outlaw the sale of any personal health information without the patient’s permission, mandate audit trails to help detect inappropriate access, and require that patients be notified whenever their records are lost or used for an unauthorized purpose. They would also beef up the penalties for noncompliance and allow state attorneys general to help enforce the rules — a useful backup in case the federal government falls down on the job. The House version would also encourage the use of protective technologies, like encryption, to protect personal medical information that will be transmitted.
Health insurance plans and some disease management groups are complaining that the new requirements would impose administrative burdens that could actually impede the use of electronic records and interfere with coordination of care. They want to ease the marketing restrictions, notify patients only if security breaches are harmful, and keep the attorneys general out of the enforcement role.
It should be possible through implementing regulations to fine-tune the privacy requirements so that they do not disrupt patient care. Congress must make every effort to ensure that patients’ privacy is protected.

Try, try again.
The giant insurer UnitedHealth Group is testing a new model of health care that many policy experts say holds great promise but has yet to prove itself.
An earlier trial of the model by UnitedHealth, in Florida, never got off the ground because doctors refused to participate. This time, however, the insurer is teaming up with seven doctors’ groups to make another attempt, in Arizona, at the prodding of one of the state’s big employers, I.B.M.
UnitedHealth will try giving doctors more authority and money than usual in return for closely monitoring their patients’ progress, even when patients go to specialists or require hospitalization. The insurer will also move away from paying doctors solely on the basis of how many services they provide, and will start rewarding them more for the overall quality of care patients receive.
The new approach, which is also being tested in various guises by other insurers around the country, is known as the “medical home” model of health care. Many experts hope it will prove one of the best ways to rein in the nation’s runaway medical costs, while making people healthier. The theory is that by providing a home base for patients and coordinating their treatment, doctors can improve care, prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room, reduce hospitalizations and lower overall medical spending.
“This gives us the opportunity to create a model to allow family physicians to practice the way we used to practice in the past,” said Dr. Jim Dearing, a family practitioner in Phoenix who is among the physicians who  have agreed to participate.
In Florida, UnitedHealth tried a similar experiment about a year and a half ago, only to meet resistance from doctors, who thought they were being asked to shoulder much of the burden with no guarantee the experiment would be successful. The insurer did not closely consult  with the doctors in designing the pilot program, and the physicians argued that  there was not enough help to pay for any necessary changes like improving their computer systems. The doctors would have received more money only if the pilot project achieved its goals.
Many Florida doctors said they thought the insurer was asking them to do too much on faith. They  were particularly skeptical about working with UnitedHealth, which has a reputation of being a tough negotiator and slow to pay claims.
“Physicians really do not like UnitedHealth, so much so they just wouldn’t work with them,” said Dr. Michael Wasylik, a surgeon who is an official with the Florida Medical Association who follows health insurance issues.
In Arizona, where UnitedHealth is I.B.M.’s sole health plan,  providing  coverage for 11,000 of the company’s employees and their dependents, I.B.M. urged the insurer to give medical homes another try.
I.B.M., which paid $21 million last year for its Arizona coverage, is among the nation’s  employers that have been increasingly vocal about their dissatisfaction with the health system,  in which they pay more money each year, regardless of the quality of the care their employees receive.
“What we buy is garbage,” said Dr. Paul Grundy, I.B.M.’s director of health care transformation, who has become a major proponent of the medical home concept.
In this experiment, UnitedHealth has worked closely with the doctors. And perhaps most importantly, the insurer has agreed to bear some of the initial costs of developing a medical home, including hiring a consultant to advise doctors on how to change their practices.
“We learned the hard way,” said Dr. Sam Ho, a chief medical officer for UnitedHealth. “You just can’t hang up a sign.”
UnitedHealth has already spent more than $1 million on three medical home experiments this year. The other two are in Colorado and Rhode Island. But the company says the Arizona pilot is getting the bulk of its money and attention.
The experiment will initially involve about 7,000 patients who are the patients of 26 doctors at the seven medical groups. I.B.M. employees will be only a small portion of the total, which will also include Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that UnitedHealth covers in the state.
Giving patients a medical home is meant to fix some of the major shortcomings of how health care is delivered and paid for in this country. Insurers now typically reward doctors for how much they do — how many tests or procedures they perform — rather than how effective their care is. Doctors are not paid to help their patients navigate  myriad specialists, and no one is held accountable for making sure that patients’ care is available whenever needed.
“If the patient can’t get into your office when sick and lands in the emergency room, it doesn’t matter that you did the blood test in your office,” said Dr. Terry McGeeney, the chief executive of the consulting unit hired by UnitedHealth to work with the Arizona practices. The unit is a for-profit business run by the American Academy of Family Physicians.
In Arizona, Dr. Dearing and other physicians will work with the consultants to figure out how better to oversee patients with conditions like diabetes. The doctors’ groups selected for the experiment were ones that had already shown signs of being able to function like medical homes.
The experiment is also intended to see whether even small groups of doctors can serve as a medical home for patients. As a solo practitioner, for example, Dr. Dearing does not use electronic health records, like a majority of doctors today.  But he and the consultants say they hope he can nonetheless devise a way to effectively track the welfare of the nearly 400 diabetic patients he treats by creating a registry, or database.
“That part of the puzzle all of us have to work on,” Dr. Dearing said.
The other major component of the experiment involves how physicians are paid. While UnitedHealth will continue to pay doctors based on the services they perform, something around the state average of about $50 for an office visit, the doctors will also receive a quarterly management fee for overseeing their patients’ care. And they will be eligible for bonuses based on quality measures like keeping a patient happy, following established treatment guidelines and being able to avoid hospital stays.
Although the insurer was reluctant to discuss the specific financial arrangement it had reached with the doctors, UnitedHealth and I.B.M. said that a participating practice could increase its overall revenue as much as 30 percent under this new reimbursement system.
The experiment is set to run through 2011. UnitedHealth says it hopes to see double-digit declines in hospital admissions and emergency room visits — in part because doctors are better able to care for patients at night, for example, or to help them avoid the kinds of complications that require more costly interventions.
Some health policy analysts worry that the push for medical homes could be yet another example of the latest health care fad — quickly embraced by employers desperate to slow their soaring health costs, and just as quickly forgotten when they do not provide immediate results.
“The purchasers want a magic bullet,” said Dr. Robert A. Berenson, a health policy expert for the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan public policy group  in Washington. “Every two years a new one comes along.”
While Mr. Berenson says he sees promise in the medical home concept, he worries that small doctors’ offices will find it too difficult to make the necessary changes to succeed.
But Dr. Ho, of UnitedHealth, points to the involvement of solo practitioners like Dr. Dearing as proof that the insurer is intent on finding a model that can be widely adopted. He acknowledges, though, that the medical home cannot cure all that ails the nation’s troubled health care system. “We’re not naïve enough to think this is a silver bullet.”
Even I.B.M. plays down the notion of a quick return. “We’re not doing this because we expect to see huge savings,”  Dr. Grundy said. The medical home, he said, is more about whether patients have access to care at the right time and whether that care is appropriate. “I think it’s the right thing to do.”

Yet it is more subtle forms of innovation that typically determine the impact of a technology in the marketplace and on society. Clever engineering, smart business models and favorable economics are the key ingredients of widespread adoption and commercial success.
History abounds with evidence. For years, much of what was known as “Yankee ingenuity” was, in fact, the American ability to pursue commercial applications of British inventions, from the Bessemer steel process to the jet engine. Even in computing, which we regard as made-in-America technology, the first stored-program computer, simple programming language and reusable code were pioneered in Britain.
But, of course, computer technology and the industry really flowered in the United States. That happened in no small part because the federal government nurtured the market with heavy investment, mainly by the Defense Department, and by choosing standards, like the Cobol programming language.
Today, Washington is about to embark on another ambitious government-guided effort to jump-start a market — in electronic health records. The program provides a textbook look at the economic and engineering challenges of technology adoption.
In its economic recovery package, the Obama administration plans to spend $19 billion to accelerate the use of computerized medical records in doctors’ offices. Medical experts agree that electronic patient records, when used wisely, can help curb costs and improve care.
The proof is seen in large medical groups, with hundreds or thousands of physicians. They sift, sort and analyze the data from digital records, for example, to better manage the health of patients with costly, chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. These larger groups have the scale to invest in information technology, and they are often insurers as well as providers, so they benefit directly from the cost savings.
Yet these large groups are the exceptions in American health care. Three-fourths of the nation’s doctors practice in small offices, with 10 doctors or fewer. For most of them, an investment in digital health records looks like a cost for which they are not reimbursed.
It is scarcely surprising, then, that only about 17 percent of the nation’s physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine.
“This is really not a technology problem,” observed Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s a matter of incentives and market failure.”
That market failure is a principal target of the Obama administration’s plan. A main  feature of the legislation calls for incentive payments of more than $40,000 spread over a few years for a physician who buys and uses electronic health records. But the technology is just a tool, one that needs to be used properly to improve health care.
So the legislation states that physicians will be paid only for the “meaningful use” of digital records. The government has not yet defined that term precisely. While the long-term goal is better health  for patients, that can take years to measure. Consequently, many health experts predict that the meaningful use will be a requirement to collect and report measurements that can be  closely correlated with improved health. Examples would be data for blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure levels for diabetes patients.
The legislation, health experts say, seems thoughtfully put together,  but the obstacles to success will be daunting. “What’s underappreciated is the implementation challenge,” said Dr. Blackford Middleton, chairman of the Center for Information Technology Leadership, a research arm of Partners Healthcare in Boston.
A crucial bridge to success, according to experts, will be how  local organizations  help doctors in small offices  adopt and use electronic records. The new legislation calls for creation of “regional health I.T. extension centers.” In a letter to the White House and Congress last month, Dr. Middleton and 50 other experts emphasized the importance of these centers and pointed to the  Primary Care Information Project in New York City as a model.
The New York project’s brief history, beginning two years ago with $27 million in financing, offers a glimpse of the challenges of wiring small physician practices. The New York team, headed by Dr. Farzad Mostashari, an assistant commissioner in the city’s health department, started by bringing in decision-support experts in medicine to study how doctors work, so the technology would be easier to use. Team members   considered writing their own software for  simple, Web-based electronic health records,  but abandoned that idea once they understood that  patient records would have to be tightly linked to billing — a physician’s financial lifeblood.
The project’s 50-member staff provides centralized technical support and education for doctors and others. “There’s no way small practices can effectively implement electronic health records on their own,” Dr. Mostashari said. “This is not the iPhone.”
The staff  worked closely with its software supplier, eClinicalWorks, to tweak and tailor the system. They began rolling out the records a little more than a year ago. They are now used by more than 1,000 physicians, mainly in poorer neighborhoods, whose workplaces include two hospital outpatient clinics, 10 community health centers, 150 small group physician practices and one women’s jail, serving a total of one million patients. The rollout is progressing, and the government plan promises to accelerate  adoption.
“Our experience here is that it’s just hard,” Dr. Mostashari said. “It’s not impossible.”

Mr. Obama announced his intention on Monday to nominate Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas to be secretary of health and human services.
He also named Nancy-Ann DeParle to coordinate health policy for the administration. Her position, counselor to the president and director of the White House Office for Health Reform, is not subject to Senate confirmation.
In separating the roles of health czar and health secretary, Mr. Obama is adding to an already large stable of experts who will help him in his effort to overhaul the health care system, one of his priorities. It was not immediately clear who would dominate, or who would corral members of the ever-growing team, with their varying viewpoints.
Mr. Obama’s first choice for secretary of health and human services, former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, was also to have been chief of the White House health office and was widely viewed as likely to be first among equals on health issues. Mr. Daschle withdrew early last month after belatedly paying more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest. In searching for a replacement, Mr. Obama decided to split the duties between two people.
At the White House news briefing on Monday, Robert Gibbs, the president’s press secretary, struggled to say who specifically would lead negotiations with Congress on health care.
Ms. DeParle will “head health care reform here in the White House,” Mr. Gibbs said, but he emphasized that “a lot of people who work in this building and in different agencies will be involved.”
“This isn’t something that’s just going to lie with one or two people,” Mr. Gibbs said, adding that that “the entire economic team” would be involved.
Administration officials said Ms. DeParle’s office would not be in the West Wing of the White House, a symbolically important location, with proximity to the president. Rather, it will be next door in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Mr. Daschle was to have had offices in the West Wing and at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: “President Obama’s health team is talented and has considerable experience, but there will obviously be competing power centers. That raises several questions. Will one of these people be dominant? To what extent will the others coordinate their activities with that individual?”
In introducing them on Monday, Mr. Obama said Ms. DeParle would provide Ms. Sebelius with “an excellent partner at the White House.” But the enterprise has many partners.
Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has stepped into the vacuum caused by the vacancy at the top of the health department and has become a dominant voice on health policy within the administration.
As budget director, Mr. Orszag would have leverage in any event because the cost of legislation to achieve universal coverage is a crucial factor. But Mr. Orszag commands additional respect because, as director of the Congressional Budget Office in 2007-8, he became an expert on health policy and health economics. He prepared two book-length studies analyzing the issue and more than 100 options for cutting costs and expanding coverage.
Another influential voice at the White House is that of Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an oncologist and medical ethicist. Dr. Emanuel, a brother of Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, is working for Mr. Orszag and is sometimes described as the kibitzer-in-chief on health policy.
While all the players agree with Mr. Obama on the goal — providing affordable health insurance to all— they have expressed different ideas about how to get there.
In a book published last year, for example, Dr. Emanuel proposed “a guaranteed health care access plan,” under which all Americans would receive vouchers to enroll in health plans offering a standard package of benefits like those available to members of Congress. The program would be administered by a National Health Board, modeled on the Federal Reserve Board.
As a House member, Rahm Emanuel showed strong interest in health care. As White House chief of staff, he led negotiations with Congress on the recent economic recovery bill. His top health policy adviser in Congress, Lauren Aronson, has joined him at the White House.
Others with influence on the issue include Melody C. Barnes, the director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House, and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council. Ms. DeParle will not be a member of either council, the White House said.
Ms. Sebelius, a former president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, is an expert on insurance regulation, which is likely to be a major component of any comprehensive health legislation.
Ms. DeParle was commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services from 1987 to 1989. Under President Bill Clinton, from 1997 to 2000, she was administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, now known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Since then, she has gained extensive experience in the business world. That experience, though seen as an asset by many, prompted questions from some of the people vetting personnel for Mr. Obama, supporters of Ms. DeParle said.
Ms. DeParle has been a director of large health care companies including Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefit manager; Cerner, a supplier of health information technology, including electronic medical records; Boston Scientific, a medical device company; DaVita, which runs kidney dialysis centers; and Triad Hospitals.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, expressed concern about the proliferation of White House policy czars for health care, urban affairs and climate change.
“Too often,” Mr. Byrd said in a letter to Mr. Obama, “I have seen these lines of authority and responsibility become tangled and blurred, sometimes purposely, to shield information and to obscure the decision-making process.”

Thank you so much, Travis, for the wonderful introduction.  Thank you for Melody Barnes, who has done more than anyone to help coordinate this forum and its extraordinary work.  And so we appreciate her leadership.
We're here today to discuss one of the greatest threats not just to the well-being of our families and the prosperity of our businesses, but to the very foundation of our economy -- and that's the exploding costs of health care in America today.
In the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages.  An additional 9 million Americans have joined the ranks of the uninsured.  The cost of health care now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds.  By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes.  Even for folks who are weathering this economic storm, and have health care right now, all it takes is one stroke of bad luck -- an accident or an illness, a divorce, a lost job -- to become one of the nearly 46 million uninsured or the millions who have health care, but really can't afford what they've got.
We didn't get here by accident.  The problems we face today are a direct consequence of actions that we failed to take yesterday.  Since Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform nearly a century ago, we have talked and we have tinkered.  We have tried and fallen short, we've stalled for time, and again we have failed to act because of Washington politics or industry lobbying.
And today, there are those who say we should defer health care reform once again -- that at a time of economic crisis, we simply can't afford to fix our health care system, as well.
Well, let me be clear:  The same soaring costs that are straining families' budgets are sinking our businesses and eating up our government's budget, too.  Too many small businesses can't insure their employees.  Major American corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts.  And companies of all sizes are shipping their jobs overseas or shutting their doors for good.
Medicare costs are consuming our federal budget; I don't have to tell members of Congress this.  Medicaid is overwhelming our state budgets; I don't need to tell governors and state legislatures that.
At the fiscal summit that we held here last week, the one thing on which everyone agreed was that the greatest threat to America's fiscal health is not Social Security, though that's a significant challenge; it's not the investments that we've made to rescue our economy during this crisis.  By a wide margin, the biggest threat to our nation's balance sheet is the skyrocketing cost of health care.  It's not even close.
That's why we cannot delay this discussion any longer.  That's why today's forum is so important -- because health care reform is no longer just a moral imperative, it's a fiscal imperative.  If we want to create jobs and rebuild our economy and get our federal budget under control, then we have to address the crushing cost of health care this year, in this administration.  Making investments in reform now, investments that will dramatically lower costs, won't add to our budget deficits in the long term -- rather, it is one of the best ways -- in fact maybe the only way -- to reduce those long-term costs.
Now, I know people are skeptical about whether Washington can bring about this change.  Our inability to reform health care in the past is just one example of how special interests have had their way, and the public interest has fallen by the wayside.  And I know people are afraid we'll draw the same old lines in the sand and give in to the same entrenched interests and arrive back at the same stalemate that we've been stuck in for decades.
But I am here today and I believe you are here today because this time is different.  This time, the call for reform is coming from the bottom up and from all across the spectrum -- from doctors, from nurses, from patients; from unions, from businesses; from hospitals, health care providers, community groups.  It's coming from mayors and governors and legislatures, Democrats, Republicans -- all who are racing ahead of Washington to pass bold health care initiatives on their own.  This time, there is no debate about whether all Americans should have quality, affordable health care -- the only question is, how?
And the purpose of this forum is to start answering that question -- to determine how we lower costs for everyone, improve quality for everyone, and expand coverage to all Americans.  And our goal will be to enact comprehensive health care reform by the end of this year.  That is our commitment.  That is our goal.
Now, in the past month alone, we've done a lot more to advance that goal than we've done in the past decade.  We've provided and protected coverage for 11 million children from working families, and for 7 million Americans who've lost their jobs in this downturn.  We've made the largest investment in history in preventive care; invested in electronic medical records that will save money, ensure privacy, and save lives; we've launched a new effort to find a cure for cancer in our time.  We've also set aside in our budget a health care reserve fund to finance comprehensive reform.  I know that more will be required, but this is a significant down payment that's fully paid for, does not add one penny to our deficit.  And I look forward to working with Congress and the American people to get this budget passed.
Now, as we work to determine the details of health care reform, we won't always see eye to eye.  We may disagree -- and disagree strongly -- about particular measures.  But we know that there are plenty of areas of agreement, as well, and that should serve as the starting points for our work.
We can all agree that if we want to bring down skyrocketing costs, we'll need to modernize our system and invest in prevention.  We can agree that if we want greater accountability and responsibility, we have to ensure that people aren't overcharged for prescription drugs, or discriminated against for pre-existing conditions -- and we need to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in government programs.  I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken.  So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance.  If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor.  They should just pay less for the care that they receive.
And finally, we can all agree that if we want to translate these goals into policies, we need a process that is as transparent and inclusive as possible.  And that's why I've asked all of you -- representatives of organizations, interests, and parties from across the spectrum -- to join us here today.  In fact, this was the hottest ticket in town.  (Laughter.)  That's why we asked concerned citizens like the folks on this stage to organize open meetings across America where people could air their views.  As Travis said, more than 3,000 meetings were held in all 50 states and D.C.; more than 30,000 people attended.  I thank them for their input and their ideas, and look forward to reading the report that Travis has presented to me.
In this effort, every voice has to be heard.  Every idea must be considered.  Every option must be on the table.  There should be no sacred cows.  Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything that we want, and that no proposal for reform will be perfect.  If that's the measure, we will never get anything done.  But when it comes to addressing our health care challenge, we can no longer let the perfect be the enemy of the essential.  And I don't think anybody would argue that we are on a sustainable path when it comes to health care.
Finally, I want to be very clear at the outset that while everyone has a right to take part in this discussion, nobody has the right to take it over and dominate.  The status quo is the one option that's not on the table, and those who seek to block any reform at all -- any reform at any costs will not prevail this time around.
I didn't come here to Washington to work for those interests.  I came here to work for the American people -- the folks I met on the campaign trail, the people I hear from every single day in the White House.  Folks who are working hard, making all the right decisions, but still face choices that no one in this country should have to make:  how long to put off that doctor's appointment; whether to fill that prescription; when to give up and head to the emergency room because there are no other options.
I've read some of the many letters they've sent asking me for help.  And they're usually not asking for much.  I don't get letters where people are just asking for a free ride, for a handout.  Most of them are embarrassed about their situation; they would rather not have to ask for help.  They start, usually, by saying that they've never written a letter like this before.  Some end by apologizing -- saying they've written to me because they have nowhere else to turn; asking me not to forget about them, not to forget about their families.
But there are a lot of people out there who are desperate.  There's a lot of desperation out there.  Today I want them, and people like them across this country, to know that I have not forgotten them.  We have not forgotten them.  They are why we're here today -- to start delivering the change they demanded at the polls in November; that they have continued to demand since the election.  And if we're successful, if we can pass comprehensive reform, these folks will see their costs come down, they'll get the care they need, and we'll help our businesses create jobs again so our economy can grow.
So it's not going to be easy.  And there are going to be false starts and setbacks and mistakes along the way.  But I'm confident if we come together and work together, we will finally achieve what generations of Americans have fought for and fulfill the promise of health care in our time.  And what a remarkable achievement that would be -- something that Democrats and Republicans, business and labor, consumer groups and providers, all of us could share extraordinary pride in finally dealing with something that has been vexing us for so long.
So let's get to work.  Thank you

He has rightly stressed the urgency of reining in skyrocketing health care costs that are straining the budgets of families, businesses, and federal and state governments.
But his proposals, for all of their ambition, do not   fully answer two central questions: how to cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans, and how to reform the health care system to reduce costs and improve the quality of care.
Mr. Obama has decided to let Congress thrash out the details of those issues, with the White House providing guidance along the way. Democratic leaders in Congress, many of whom are far more versed in the issues than the president is, will have to step up and fashion an effective bill. If they falter, Mr. Obama will need to step in with a clear vision and vigorous leadership.
To his credit, the president has tackled the first tough issue of how to pay for expanded coverage and systemic reforms. His budget has proposed huge expenditures — $634 billion over 10 years — as a down payment, and it clearly specifies where to find the money.
Half would come from raising taxes on the rich, another quarter from eliminating unjustified subsidies for private plans that participate in Medicare, and other big chunks from reducing payments to drug companies, hospitals and the home health care industry.
Yet even the administration admits that $634 billion will not be enough to reach universal coverage:  some experts think it will take at least twice that amount.
The administration has also given no clue as to how it will significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans — now 46 million and growing. The expanded children’s health insurance program, which Mr. Obama signed into law early last month, will cover more than four million uninsured children, and his stimulus bill will help millions more Americans retain or gain coverage. But this, too, is only a down payment on the problem.
The president’s main focus is on starting to reduce the soaring cost of health care. That, he argues,  is a prerequisite to making universal coverage affordable and politically palatable. But in the meantime, many millions of uninsured Americans continue to go without adequate care. Congress will need to look hard at whether bigger strides can be made toward universal coverage at the same time that costs are addressed.
The president’s plans make a start toward reforming the health care delivery system, but it is only a start. His stimulus program is pouring money into electronic medical records, preventive care and comparative effectiveness studies of medical treatments — all of which should help improve care and possibly lower costs in the long run. His budget plan calls for Medicare to change its reimbursement rates for hospitals to promote higher quality, greater efficiency and substantial savings.
All told, the changes are projected to cut the growth rate in Medicare spending — from 7.3 percent a year to 6.1 percent in the fifth year. That looks like a modest reduction for now, but when compounded over many decades, it could greatly reduce projected Medicare expenditures by midcentury. Since Medicare policies often ripple through the entire health care system, overall health expenditures should slow.
Meanwhile, the administration has deliberately ducked some of the most contentious issues. There is no mention of requiring individuals to carry health insurance on themselves or their children. No mention of requiring employers to pay for coverage. No mention of having a public plan compete with private plans in a national insurance exchange. No discussion of whether employee health benefits should be taxed. No talk of requiring insurers to cover all applicants. No mention of government negotiating Medicare drug prices.
The White House has obviously decided that it is best to let Congress work out the compromises and decide how to allocate the pain. That is the opposite of the Clinton administration’s approach. It hatched a highly detailed plan in secret that never won Congressional support and crashed under a barrage of opposition from affected industries.
We do not challenge Mr. Obama’s political instincts. We simply note that someone will need to make the hard choices if health care reform and universal coverage are to succeed.

Re “Taking Innovation Beyond the ‘Aha’ ” (Unboxed, March 1), about the move toward electronic medical records:
How to make a successful medical record? Simplify what’s shared.
I’ve been a physician for 11 years and worked in three health care systems. I’ve never worked in an office with paper charts, only electronic records. I’ve also been an administrator who has wrestled with how to share those records between offices.
While the records may sound simple, they are preposterously complicated, with thousands of data points per chart. Some information, of course, is valuable to providers across the continuum of health care, but other information should never leave the office. It is important to know about medications, allergies, test results, etc. But do you want every health care professional — or billing clerk or receptionist — to know, for example, that you got a sexually transmitted disease from your husband? (Doctors may record such information because it helps them recall and understand how to relate to individual patients.)
There is a way — through what’s known as a continuity of care record — to abstract health information that is widely useful without compromising more personal data. Before we embark on vastly expanding electronic records, let’s decide how to use them well.  Lou Lukas, M.D.

Two articles, to be published on Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, point to the formidable obstacles to achieving the policy goal of not only installing electronic health records, but also using them to improve care and curb costs.
One article reports that only 9 percent of the nation’s hospitals have electronic health records, based on a survey of nearly 3,000 hospitals. The study, financed by the federal government and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is the most definitive measure to date of the use of computerized patient records by hospitals. The government-backed study found a far lower level of use than some earlier, less rigorous surveys.
The study, the authors said, measured only the adoption of digital patient records. The survey did not ask whether the electronic records were used to advance the health policy goals of the federal plan, like tracking the quality of care and communicating effectively with outside specialists and clinics to coordinate a patient’s care.
“We have a long way to go,” said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who was the article’s lead author. “And we did not measure effective use. Even if a hospital does have electronic health records, it does not mean it is sharing information with other hospitals and doctors down the road.”
In a second article in the journal, two experts in health information technology at Children’s Hospital Boston assert that spending billions of dollars of federal funds to stimulate the adoption of existing forms of health record software would be a costly policy mistake.
In the article, identified as a “perspective,” Dr. Kenneth D. Mandl and Dr. Isaac S. Kohane portray the current health record suppliers as offering pre-Internet era software — costly and wedded to proprietary technology standards that make it difficult for customers to switch vendors and for outside programmers to make upgrades and improvements.
Instead of stimulating use of such software, they say, the government should be a rule-setting referee to encourage the development of an open software platform on which innovators could write electronic health record applications. As analogies, they point to other such software platforms — whether the Web or Apple’s iPhone software, which the company has opened to outside developers.
In the Mandl-Kohane model, a software developer with a new idea for health record features like drug allergy alerts or care guidelines could write an application, and those could be added or substituted for a similar feature.
Such an approach, they say, would open the door to competition, flexibility and lower costs — and thus, better health care in the long run. “If the government’s money goes to cement the current technology in place,” Dr. Mandl said in an interview, “we will have a very hard time innovating in health care reform.”
To justify spending taxpayers’ money, the government program must expand digital records beyond routine tasks like billing to focus on “how the technology will be used to improve clinical performance,” said Herbert S. Lin, a senior scientist the National Academy of Sciences, an advisory group to the government.
The Obama administration’s health technology plan, which is part of the economic recovery package, includes incentive payments for adopting electronic health records — more than $40,000 per physician and up to several million dollars for hospitals. The payments are spread over a few years and are based on “meaningful use” of “certified” records, although Congress left defining those terms to the Department of Health and Human Services.
The incentive payments, industry experts say, are enough to greatly accelerate the adoption of electronic health records. In the new survey of hospitals, the cost of digital record systems was cited as the single largest obstacle to adoption.
Dr. David Blumenthal, a professor at the Harvard Medical School, oversaw the hospital study. Last week he was named the national coordinator for health information technology in the Obama administration. In a conference call to discuss the study, Dr. Blumenthal declined to talk about his plans in detail.
But clearly, he sees electronic health records as a tool to reform health care, and the Obama administration intends to shift Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement toward paying for better health outcomes, which will be measured and monitored using technology.
“The goals are quality and efficiency, instead of just putting machinery in offices,” Dr. Blumenthal said. “If we encourage better performance, then physicians are going to find ways to improve performance. And health information technology is one crucial way to do that.”

His stimulus package will provide $19 billion over the next two years to promote the adoption and use of health information technology, and he has pledged to spend some $50 billion in all over five years.
There is a long way to go. A new study reveals that American hospitals have been appallingly slow to adopt electronic records, just as previous studies have shown that American physicians have been very slow to computerize their operations. By contrast, a vast majority of doctors in four other industrialized nations have adopted electronic records, although hospitals are thought to be lagging.
The study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine and led by Harvard researchers, including Dr. David Blumenthal, who has been chosen by Mr. Obama to be national coordinator of health information technology.
The researchers surveyed some 3,000 acute-care hospitals last year. Only 1.5 percent had a comprehensive electronic-records system in all major clinical units that performed all 24 functions deemed important by a panel of experts. Such systems incorporated physicians’ and nurses’ notes, the ability to order laboratory and radiological tests, clinical guidelines on how to treat various conditions and alerts to avoid dangerous drug interactions, among other capabilities. Only 11 percent of the hospitals had even a basic system in at least one major clinical unit that performed eight functions.
The main impediment is money. Many hospitals simply do not have the capital to buy systems that can cost $20 million to $200 million, especially when so many are struggling to remain solvent. Hospitals also worry about high maintenance costs, an uncertain payoff on their investment, a lack of staff with adequate technical expertise and resistance from doctors.
The president’s stimulus plan should help ease the financial obstacles. It will provide $17 billion in financial incentives (higher payments through Medicare or Medicaid) to get hospitals and doctors to adopt electronic health records and will impose financial penalties on those that do not. Another $2 billion will help hospitals and doctors keep their systems working and up-to-date.
The ultimate goal is an “interoperable” system that would allow easy exchange of clinical data between hospitals and doctors. The modernization effort will have limited value if a mélange of different computer systems can’t talk to one another.

The companies, in a partnership announced on Thursday, plan to spend $250 million jointly in the next five years on research and development of health technologies to let doctors  remotely monitor, diagnose and consult with patients in their homes or assisted-living residences.
Both companies have fledgling offerings in the field of telehealth, as it is known,  and home health monitoring. Intel has just introduced  a special-purpose computer with two-way video capability, which is linked over the Internet to a doctor, nurse or physician assistant, called Intel Health Guide.
Under the partnership, General Electric, whose $17 billion-a-year health care business ranges from medical imaging equipment to electronic health records, agreed to distribute  Intel’s computer system through its worldwide sales force.
For the last few years G.E. has built a small business unit, GE QuietCare, which uses motion sensors to monitor older patients, mostly in communities for the elderly, so caregivers can be alerted to unusual patterns of activity, or inactivity, that might signal a health problem or emergency.
G.E. and Intel are pursuing what they expect to be a new multibillion-dollar market for using technology to automate and streamline the management of chronic conditions as populations age, both in the United States and in other nations.
A handful of chronic ailments, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, account for up to 80 percent of health care costs, according to medical experts, and 7 of 10 deaths in the United States.
Such chronic conditions, unless aggressively managed, worsen as people grow older. By 2030, about 71.5 million Americans will be 65 or older, the federal government estimates, up from 37 million in 2006.
The current market for telehealth and home health monitoring in North America and Europe is $3 billion, according to Data Monitor, a research firm, and is projected to rise to $7.7 billion by 2012. But much of remote monitoring today is done by nurses and physician assistants, who  call  patients with reminders and advice.
“Today’s systems just won’t scale,” said Louis J. Burns, general manager of Intel’s digital health group. “Health care has to go efficiently into the home, to enable elders to age in place with dignity.”
The early market for their high-tech remote monitoring systems, the companies’ executives say, will be integrated health providers in the United States and abroad, insurers and specialized disease-management companies.
Intel has sold systems to Advanced Warning Systems, a disease management company, and has pilot projects under way with several institutions ranging from the American insurer Aetna to a Scottish region of Britain’s National Health Service.
Managing chronic conditions is typically not reimbursed  in America’s fee-for-service system of health care, which pays for procedures, treatments and office visits but often not preventive care.
But there have been some Medicare pilot projects to pay providers based on improved health outcomes for patients, mainly those with chronic conditions. And the Obama administration has pledged to accelerate that drive, promoting electronic health records, for example, as a way to measure the quality of care and health outcomes.
Analysts and industry executives say the market for personal health care technology, like remote monitoring, could benefit considerably if reimbursement moves toward a pay-for-performance system.
“If nothing changes, this is going to be a big business because of the demographics,” said Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of G.E. “But the only way to really change health care is to have some metrics about outcomes and quality. And you need technology to do that.”

And as job losses continue to climb, they may well drag bankruptcy filings along with them.
An average of 5,945 bankruptcy petitions were filed each day in March, up 9 percent from February and up 38 percent compared with a year earlier, according to Mike Bickford, president of Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, a bankruptcy data and management company. In all, 130,793 people filed for bankruptcy in March.
The weak economy and  its repercussions — rising unemployment, lower pay, fewer people with health insurance, and the mortgage and foreclosure crises — are all playing a role in  the big increase in bankruptcies. And some of the most common factors that tend to  lead to bankruptcy filings — divorce and disruptive health problems — have not gone away.
But the biggest factor in the current spate of filings may be the tightening of credit.
“We have a lot of people out of work, but that alone is not driving the spike in bankruptcy filings,” said Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. “Along with job loss is the tightening of consumer credit. Compared to 18 months ago, the American consumer does not have the same ability to borrow in an attempt to stave off the day of reckoning. With no income and no credit, it is not surprising that the middle class is looking to the bankruptcy courts for relief.”
Professor Lawless said he expected total bankruptcy filings to reach 1.45 million to 1.5 million by the end of the year, compared with nearly 1.1 million filings in 2008, an increase of 31 percent to 36 percent. It also means that filings are fast approaching the average number of annual filings of about 1.4 million before the new bankruptcy law took effect in October 2005.
“It shows you that a lot more people are hurting,” Mr. Bickford said. “Even with the more restrictive law in place, the filings are back up to the prelaw level.”
The law, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, made it more difficult for consumers to erase their debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcies. Those who earn more than their state’s median income are now required to first pass a means test  — based on income, living expenses and other factors. If  they are deemed able to repay some debts, they are then forced to pursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which sets up a three- or five-year repayment plan and makes it more difficult to get a fresh start.
“In a nutshell, bankruptcies happen because financial distress happens,” said Jack Williams, resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute and a bankruptcy professor at the Georgia State University College of Law. “It is hubris to think that we can manage such a complex system by inserting a means test here, a credit counseling requirement there.”
Keith and Leola Gladney of St. Charles, Mo., filed for  Chapter 13 bankruptcy last summer. Their problems  began to unfold in September  2007, when Mrs. Gladney, who was pregnant, was put on bed rest and could no longer work as a marketing assistant. They lost her income, though she did receive short-term disability payments. In January 2008, Mr. Gladney, 38, lost his job as a manager of an auto parts store. Within months, the couple had  fallen behind on the mortgage payments on their home, which they bought for $130,000 in 2004.
They lost the house around the time their son was born in March 2008, and the couple had to move into a hotel with their newborn. Though they eventually found an apartment to rent, the Gladneys decided to file for bankruptcy. Adding to their troubles, Mrs. Gladney, 37, found out last November that she did not have a job to return to.
“It is really stressful for me because I thought I would find another job,”  she said.
Mr. Gladney said he was hopeful that he was  close to receiving a job offer on one of the 30 or so résumés he sends out daily. “We are trying to keep our heads up and keep a positive attitude and hope things will get better,” he said. “We go to church every Sunday. We haven’t changed our routine.”
If history is any guide, the number of bankruptcy filings will increase through this year, but  will not  jump as much as they did from February to March because that tends to be a popular time  for filing, Professor Lawless said. But if legislation is passed that would allow bankruptcy judges to modify some primary mortgages, filings could rise significantly.
The House has approved a version of that so-called cramdown legislation, but the Senate did not have enough votes to overcome a filibuster by Republicans, who want the modifications to apply to a much smaller pool of loans. The Senate Democrats are working on a compromise, and say they  hope they can bring the bill to the floor after Congress returns from recess on April 20.
The power to modify home mortgages would probably lead  many more people to pursue bankruptcy to save their homes. If the legislation were to pass, Mr. Lawless said, 1.6 million would be a conservative estimate of the number of bankruptcy filings this year.
“We have to remember that prebankruptcy negotiations take place in the shadow of the bankruptcy law,” he added. “We would expect that banks would be more likely to come to the negotiation table.”
Regardless of what happens, the number of consumers filing for bankruptcy is expected to continue to climb even after the economy begins to  recover.
“What is sobering about these numbers is that bankruptcy is generally a lagging economic indicator,” Professor Williams said. “So even as the economy starts to turn around down the road, we will still continue to see bankruptcy filings increase even past that turning point, and that trend will continue anywhere from three to five quarters.”

Medical information will flow directly from the military to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system. At present, some veterans must hand carry their medical records to Veterans Affairs’ facilities once they leave active-duty service because their records are missing. The Veterans Affairs system has a backlog of 800,000 disability claims, which means that veterans typically wait six months for decisions on their cases.
The task of creating a unified system will be handled by the Departments of Defense and  Veterans Affairs. The undertaking has repeatedly confounded the two agencies in the past, and it remains unclear how long the project will take and how much it will cost.
Both Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki joined Mr. Obama for the announcement, but provided no details.
“We have a sacred trust with those who wear the uniform of the United States of America, a commitment that begins with enlistment and must never end,” Mr. Obama said. “But we know that for too long we’ve fallen short of meeting that commitment. Too many wounded warriors go without the care that they need.”
Mr. Obama also voiced support for a measure that would allow Congress to approve the money for veterans’ medical care one year in advance. Congress has been routinely late in passing the bill that finances the Department of Veterans Affairs, a delay that hampers medical care for veterans and makes planning difficult.
The budget resolution recently passed by the Senate includes the proposal. The Senate and the House are now negotiating the differences between their  bills.
“The care that our veterans receive should never be hindered by budget delays,” Mr. Obama said.
The announcements are part of a larger effort to improve services for veterans. Mr. Obama’s budget for 2010 increases spending for veterans by $25 billion and funnels more money into programs for those who suffer mental health problems and traumatic brain injury.
Veterans’ advocacy groups called Thursday’s announcement an important step in smoothing the tangle of bureaucracy that frequently overburdens the veterans’ health care system.
Paul Rieckhoff, the executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that modernizing medical records and allowing the two systems — military and veterans affairs — to talk to each other would have a dramatic effect on care.
Recently, Mr. Rieckhoff said, a Veterans Affairs doctor told him he had encountered a soldier with a brain injury, an amputation and a septic leg. The doctor had no idea how the man had been hurt because he did not have a complete file, he said.
“If you are a wounded service member, you have no continuity through the system,” Mr. Rieckhoff said on Thursday.
In creating a unified electronic system and pushing for more predictability in financing, Mr. Obama is trying to address two chronic stumbling blocks for improving care for veterans.
“He is setting Shinseki up for success,” Mr. Rieckhoff said of the department  secretary. “He has a mountain of problems ahead of him and a big mess to clear up.”

A year ago, she switched her 3,000 patients from paper charts to electronic health records, a core feature of most plans for healing the nation’s ailing health system. Now, working with computers and printouts, her staff of part-time nurses and shared front-office workers has  more time to help her meet the needs of patients.
“I’ll never go back to the old system,” said Dr. Brull, 37, who runs a solo practice in Plainville, Kan. “I can always look at the records by Internet, whether I am seeing patients at the nursing home or a clinic or the hospital, or even when I’m as far away as Florida. The change has been tremendously beneficial for my productivity.”
Patients are appreciative, too. Kagay Wheatley brings her 97-year-old neighbor, Charlotte Hayes, to Dr. Brull for blood tests every few weeks. “We do not have to sit and wait while the nurses search for the records,” said Ms. Wheatley, a retired school board aide who is also a patient of Dr. Brull’s. “They find the information right there on the computer, and when we leave, we get a printout of what we did and what she said.”
About 42 percent of active family doctors have installed some type of electronic health records, according to surveys and estimates by the American Academy of Family Physicians, a professional and advocacy group. One in four said they did not plan to purchase an electronic system, and many said they could not afford the $30,000 to $50,000 in start-up costs. The academy has 94,600 members, including about 60,000 in active practice.
Medical centers like the new 24-bed critical-access hospital in Plainville, connected by a walkway to Dr. Brull’s office, are also rapidly adopting electronic records.
“The use of electronic health records and being able to transmit X-rays allows us to be in contact with the whole world,” said Chuck Comeau, a hospital board member who is chief executive of Dessin Fournir, a national furniture design company that moved its head office to Plainville  from Los Angeles.
Even so, 8 in 10 of all American doctors still labor in a world of paper. And some doctors said they encountered upsetting setbacks when they tried to switch to electronic records.
Michael Ferris, a 33-year-old emergency medicine physician in Parsons, Kan., said he had to give up his solo practice after he had invested $38,000 in software for systems that kept crashing and thwarting his attempts to send out electronic bills. “I was spending as much time trying to fix the computer and the billing as actually seeing patients,” he said, “and neither process was generating any revenue for me.”
Now, as director of the emergency room at the Labette County hospital in Parsons, Dr. Ferris said, “I get paid by the hour and don’t have to worry if the software is down.” But he said he expected that some day he would have to help the hospital make the transition to electronic records. “I know it is coming.”
Information technology for health care is a $20 billion section of the $787 billion economic stimulus package President Obama signed last month. But only part of the new I.T. financing will help individual doctors who convert to electronic health records, said Dr. Steven Waldren, director of the center for health information technology at the academy of family physicians. Those in rural and underserved areas should benefit the most.
“For the vast majority of physicians, there is not going to be upfront money to purchase electronic record systems,” Dr. Waldren said.
Dr. Brull, who grew up in Grinnell, Kan., a town with 250 residents, has been an advocate of electronic records since she was in medical school at the University of Kansas in the 1990s. Seven years ago she moved to Plainville, where she rents space in a community-owned medical office building and shares a receptionist and bookkeeping staff with two other family physicians, Dan Sanchez, 45, and Lynn Fisher, 34.
They have 8,000 patients in all, including some from neighboring counties. The three doctors together cover a lot of ground: delivering babies, performing colon cancer checkups and staffing the emergency room at the hospital. They refer patients who need intensive care or a specialist to the Hays Medical Center, 23 miles away. Trauma patients are flown to Wichita, a one-hour helicopter ride. Specialists, including a cardiologist, come to Plainville to provide follow-up care.
The three are the only doctors in Plainville, a city of 2,500 in Rooks County, a wheat farming and oil-producing area midway between Kansas City and Denver. “We are it,” Dr. Brull said.
Dr. Sanchez is a deputy coroner and the ambulance service director and is taking a turn as hospital medical director. Each doctor is a solo practitioner with a separate tax ID. “At the end of the day, our paychecks come from our own business, our own patients,” Dr. Fisher said.
They are informal partners, and cover each other’s patients. “We do everything on a handshake,” Dr. Brull said.
It took five years for her to persuade the other doctors to make the switch to electronic records. “Dan was our holdout,” she said.
Dr. Sanchez explained that, at first, “I was not sure I saw the benefits. Now I’m a very big proponent of it. I’ve gotten to the place where I prefer to get an electronic chart over a paper chart.”
Costs, like those to have his dictation transcribed, are down 75 percent. “The volume of paper flowing around has dropped dramatically,” he said. “That alone paid for half the cost of the software in the first year.”
They selected a medium-priced system (from e-MDs, based in Austin, Tex.), obtained private financing and invested $45,000 in software. Dr. Brull said she paid “the lion’s share for the equipment — $40,000 or $50,000 for hardware,” which they also share. Staff members were sent out for training, and last March they closed the offices for two days of instruction. When they reopened, a trainer stayed to help.
The electronic system helps Dr. Brull with just about every part of her practice. She keeps close watch on 250 patients with high blood pressure and 180 who have diabetes. She pays special attention to people who have both problems, summoning them for blood tests every six weeks
The computers make it easier to keep track of them. “We can run a computer report on diabetics who haven’t had appropriate lab work, or people who haven’t had a wellness exam in 10 months or did not have a flu shot,” she said.
When she leaves the office to see patients at a nursing home, she said: “I have access to my notes on each one on the laptop. It takes out the guesswork.” For people who pick up their pills at Walgreens or Wal-Mart, the software forwards an electronic prescription. “We are working to persuade the mom-and-pop pharmacies to get on that system,” she said.
Dr. Brull said she expected to recoup her investment in five years, perhaps sooner. It did not hurt that two other family doctors left the community last April. “All of a sudden, three or four thousand patients had no doctor,” she said. “We took on a large volume. If you work harder, you get more money.”
Still, she said she shared the frustrations of many physicians who say the insurance companies often seem to use delaying tactics to avoid paying for care, even when the bills are delivered to them by computer. “I feel like I spend a lot of time justifying what I do and chasing the dollar,” she said. But despite such concerns, she said, she is too busy to have much time left for complaining. “I am not a very good pessimist,” Dr. Brull said.

But while policy makers, hospitals, doctors and technology companies debate the best ways to give every health care provider computer access to patient records, patients can’t help but wonder: What’s in this for me?
There is obvious appeal in the idea of an electronic file controlled by the patient but accessible with his or her permission by doctors, hospitals and insurers — a file that could be continually updated with all new medical procedures, prescriptions and tests. That kind of detailed record and seamless communication could improve the quality of health care and help reduce dangerous medical errors. And by improving the efficiency of medicine, it might also help curb the nation’s skyrocketing health care costs.
Lured by such promises, 4 of every 10 consumers are interested in creating an online personal health record that can be shared with physicians, according to a recent survey conducted by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.
Trouble is, “we’ve got a long way to go before we get there,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, associate professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Jha has been involved in several studies on electronic medical records.
In reality, very few doctors have set up their own electronic record-keeping systems, let alone ones that are compatible with patients’ home-based files. And “only 9 percent of hospitals use electronic records,” said Dr. Jha, who was the lead author of a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, pointing to the field’s current limitations.
What’s more, building your personal electronic medical file can be time-consuming and cumbersome. My quick test drive of the four most visible online health record keepers — Google Health Records, Microsoft HealthVault, RevolutionHealth Health Record and WebMd Personal Health Record — made it clear to me that, for now, interested consumers will in many cases spend hours tracking down information from doctors, hospitals and labs, and then painstakingly entering the data into the electronic record themselves.
And patients will need to be scrupulous about making sure the electronic records are up to date and accurate. I was startled to read about a patient’s experience with one of these systems, and the inaccurate data he discovered in his file, as reported this week in The Boston Globe.
All the upfront work of setting up an electronic health record can be easier and more worthwhile if you happen to be one of the few patients whose health care providers are themselves making an electronic push. Both Google and Microsoft have forged some early partnerships with big medical centers, including New York Presbyterian, the Cleveland Clinic and Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston. Google and Microsoft also both share data with several big pharmacies and other health care providers. And the Microsoft HealthVault, for instance, lets patients download data from various medical monitoring devices. One Cleveland Clinic patient with hypertension, a long-distance truck driver, was able, from the road, to feed his doctor daily results from his blood pressure monitor. Based on that data, the doctor instructed the man to adjust his medications, and the driver was able to stabilize his blood pressure in a matter of days.
The list of partnerships with health providers is expected to grow as both Microsoft and Google push to become the leader in the personal electronic medical records business. But progress is being slowed by incompatible technologies, privacy concerns and resistance by many health care providers to installing expensive electronic systems.
For most patients, Dr. Jha says, it probably makes more sense to wait until one’s primary care doctor or other regular health care provider makes the move toward shared electronic records. “Then you can get the full benefit of seamless communication,” he said.
There are exceptions. If you have a chronic health condition, or you are taking care of a family member or someone else with such a condition, electronic records might make a lot of sense.
“Having a full history, health provider contact information and a list of current prescription drugs that any caregiver can get their hands on is invaluable in an emergency,” said Dr. Ted Epperly, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
And electronic records can make it easier to monitor chronic conditions, said Dr. C. Martin Harris, chief information officer of the Cleveland Clinic and head of the National Health Information Infrastructure Task Force.
“Say you have diabetes,” Dr. Harris said. “Before, you would go home, check your blood sugar and write down the results on a piece of paper somewhere and then lose it. With electronic records you have an organized place to store the data and an appropriate way to present them to your doctor. That means he or she can use the data much more effectively.”
If you decide to become an early adopter of electronic medical records, you must be vigilant about updating your files every time a medical event takes place, Dr. Epperly advises. That means everything from refilling a prescription to visiting the emergency room.
“If your doctor is under the impression the records are up to date, but a prescription is missing or a surgery follow-up isn’t listed,” he said, “that can be dangerous.”
With all these caveats in mind, here are brief descriptions of four of the online health record systems now being offered, at no initial fee, to consumers who might want to set up their own electronic medical files.
GOOGLE HEALTH Google’s system has partnerships with the Cleveland Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess, Quest Diagnostics, several pharmacies and other organizations. Google Health will let you connect to vendors who, for a fee, will transcribe your paper medical records into your electronic file.
MICROSOFT HEALTHVAULT Some users may be able to import data from a small group of medical providers including New York Presbyterian Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Quest Laboratories, several pharmacies and others. HealthVault also has agreements with medical device makers to let patients import data from devices like blood pressure and blood glucose monitors.
REVOLUTIONHEALTH HEALTH RECORDS Users input medical data themselves, or RevolutionHealth employees will input records faxed to them directly from your health care providers. You will be directed to information and advice on the Revolution Health site related to your medical condition.
WEBMD PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD This system lets users store medical records, family histories and other health data. The site will direct you to WebMD information and tools related to your health data.

So imagine his surprise a few years ago  when he learned he owed  thousands of dollars worth of emergency-service medical bills.
Mr. Sharp, as it turned out, was a victim of a fast-growing crime known as medical identity theft.
At the time,  Mr. Sharp was about to get married and buy his first home. Before applying for a mortgage he requested a copy of his credit report. That is when he found he had several collection notices under his name for emergency room visits throughout the country.
“There was even a $19,000 bill for a Life Flight air ambulance service in some remote location I’d never heard of,” said Mr. Sharp, who made this unhappy discovery in 2003. “I had emergency room bills from places like Bowling Green, Kan., where I’ve never even visited. I’m still cleaning up the mess.”
The last time federal data on the crime was collected, for a 2007 report, more than 250,000 Americans a year were victims of medical identity theft. That number has almost certainly increased since then, because of the increased use of electronic medical records systems built without extensive safeguards, said Pam Dixon, executive director of the nonprofit World Privacy Forum and author of a report on medical identity theft.
And uncountable, Ms. Dixon said, are the people who do not yet know they are victims. They may not  know that their medical information has been tampered with for months or even years until, as in Mr. Sharp’s case, it shows up in collections on a credit report.
Medical identity theft takes many guises. In Mr. Sharp’s case, someone got  hold of his name and Social Security number and used them to receive emergency medical services, which many hospitals are obliged to provide whether or not a person has insurance. Mr. Sharp still does not know whether he fell victim to one calamitous perp who ended up in several emergency rooms or a ring  of accident-prone conspirators.
In another variant of the crime, someone can use  stolen insurance information, like  the basic member ID and group policy number found on insurance cards, to impersonate you —  and receive everything from a routine physical to major surgery under your coverage. This is surprisingly easy to do, because many doctors and hospitals do not  ask for identification beyond insurance information.
Even more common, however, are cases where medical information is stolen by insiders at a medical office. Thieves download vital personal insurance data and related information from the operation’s  computerized medical records,  then sell it on the black market or use it themselves to make fraudulent billing claims.
In a widely reported case in 2006, a clerk at a Cleveland Clinic branch office in Weston, Fla., downloaded the records of more than 1,100 Medicare patients and gave the information to her cousin, who in turn, made $2.8 million in bogus claims.
When people are not aware their medical identities have been stolen,  insurance companies may simply continue to pay the fraudulent claims without the victim’s knowledge. The person might learn of the fraud only when trying to make a legitimate claim,  and the insurance company informs them they have reached their lifetime cap on benefits.
Or victims may eventually discover erroneous information in their medical files during a doctor or hospital visit. And that may pose a bigger danger than the financial risks. The medical records may now contain vital information like blood type, allergies, prescription drug use or a history of disease that is just plain wrong. In an emergency, doctors could  treat you based on this erroneous information.
And  there are none of the consumer protections for medical identity theft victims that exist for traditional identity theft. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you can get a free copy of your credit report each year, put a fraud alert on your account and get erroneous charges deleted from your record. If your credit card is stolen and the thief goes on a spending spree, you’re not liable for more than $50 worth of the charges.
With medical identity theft, though, the fraudulent charges can remain unpaid and unresolved for years, permanently damaging your credit rating. Under the federal law  known as Hipaa — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act —  you are entitled to a copy of your medical records, but you may have to pay a hefty fee for them.
Worse, Hipaa privacy rules can actually work against you. Once your medical information is intermingled with someone else’s, you may have trouble accessing your files. Privacy laws dictate that the thief’s medical information now contained in your records must be kept confidential, too.
Even when you are able to correct a record, say in your doctor’s office, the erroneous information may have been passed on to dozens of other health care providers and insurers. Victims must track down and resolve these errors largely on a case-by-case basis,  Ms. Dixon says.
Medical providers contend that they are taking precautions against identity theft.  At Cleveland Clinic, for example, security personnel routinely audit electronic medical record systems and all records are password-protected.  Many Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers use software to screen for spikes in claims from providers that look suspicious. They also work with providers on encrypting medical files and carrying out data access restrictions, said Calvin Sneed, senior antifraud consultant at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
And some  medical centers and doctors’ offices now require patients to show photo ID and attach photos to patient charts.
But privacy advocates worry that these steps do not go nearly far enough, especially in light of President Obama’s plans to spend $20 billion to increase the use of electronic medical records nationwide as part of the stimulus package. “Without aggressive safeguards, we could be building an infrastructure for massive medical fraud,” said Ms. Dixon.

Re “If All Doctors Had Time to Listen” (June 7), which described approaches to trying to improve primary care:
The article looked at one model of care that seems unrealistic for a majority of Americans: the idea of doctors receiving a monthly cash fee from each patient, plus fees for office visits, without accepting insurance. Almost all patients who contact a new physician ask if their insurance is accepted as payment and, if not, look elsewhere. Cost, rather than quality, is their first concern.
This model also does not solve the problem of too much demand for too few primary care doctors; it would achieve the complete opposite, as only a fraction as many patients are cared for every day.

To the Editor:
One necessary solution to our nation’s health care crisis is to increase the number of primary care physicians. This would allow all Americans to access doctors with the time to listen to their problems, rather than reserving that privilege for the lucky few.
Our organization of specialty-care physicians calls for increased reimbursement for primary care doctors as a way to increase their numbers and allow them to spend more time with individual patients, even if specialty-care reimbursement must be cut as a necessary spending offset. Our nation’s health is better served by a stronger primary care network than by paying its specialists so handsomely.

To the Editor:
It is wonderful that some medical doctors are able to convert the financial savings of using computerized medical records into more time with their patients.
But what about when patients appear at emergency rooms? Do their medical records readily appear on the E.R. doctor’s computer? Or must they wait for a fax with only partial records?
It is crucial that electronic records be standardized across the health care system.

From the moment I took office as President, the central challenge we have confronted as a nation has been the need to lift ourselves out of the worst recession since World War II.  In recent months, we have taken a series of extraordinary steps, not just to repair the immediate damage to our economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting and sustained growth.  We are creating new jobs. We are unfreezing our credit markets. And we are stemming the loss of homes and the decline of home values.
But even as we have made progress, we know that the road to prosperity remains long and difficult.  We also know that one essential step on our journey is to control the spiraling cost of health care in America.
Today, we are spending over $2 trillion a year on health care – almost 50 percent more per person than the next most costly nation.  And yet, for all this spending, more of our citizens are uninsured; the quality of our care is often lower; and we aren't any healthier. In fact, citizens in some countries that spend less than we do are actually living longer than we do.
Make no mistake: the cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It is an escalating burden on our families and businesses. It is a ticking time-bomb for the federal budget.  And it is unsustainable for the United States of America.
It is unsustainable for Americans like Laura Klitzka, a young mother I met in Wisconsin last week, who has learned that the breast cancer she thought she'd beaten had spread to her bones; who is now being forced to spend time worrying about how to cover the $50,000 in medical debts she has already accumulated, when all she wants to do is spend time with her two children and focus on getting well. These are not worries a woman like Laura should have to face in a nation as wealthy as ours.
Stories like Laura's are being told by women and men all across this country – by families who have seen out-of-pocket costs soar, and premiums double over the last decade at a rate three times faster than wages.  This is forcing Americans of all ages to go without the checkups or prescriptions they need.  It's creating a situation where a single illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings.
Our costly health care system is unsustainable for doctors like Michael Kahn in New Hampshire, who, as he puts it, spends 20 percent of each day supervising a staff explaining insurance problems to patients, completing authorization forms, and writing appeal letters; a routine that he calls disruptive and distracting, giving him less time to do what he became a doctor to do and actually care for his patients.
Small business owners like Chris and Becky Link in Nashville are also struggling.  They've always wanted to do right by the workers at their family-run marketing firm, but have recently had to do the unthinkable and lay off a number of employees – layoffs that could have been deferred, they say, if health care costs weren't so high. Across the country, over one third of small businesses have reduced benefits in recent years and one third have dropped their workers' coverage altogether since the early 90's.
Our largest companies are suffering as well. A big part of what led General Motors and Chrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they racked up providing health care for their workers; costs that made them less profitable, and less competitive with automakers around the world. If we do not fix our health care system, America may go the way of GM; paying more, getting less, and going broke.
When it comes to the cost of our health care, then, the status quo is unsustainable. Reform is not a luxury, but a necessity. I know there has been much discussion about what reform would cost, and rightly so. This is a test of whether we – Democrats and Republicans alike – are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline.
But let there be no doubt – the cost of inaction is greater. If we fail to act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, and the rolls of uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans.
If we fail to act, one out of every five dollars we earn will be spent on health care within a decade.  In thirty years, it will be about one out of every three – a trend that will mean lost jobs, lower take-home pay, shuttered businesses, and a lower standard of living for all Americans.
And if we fail to act, federal spending on Medicaid and Medicare will grow over the coming decades by an amount almost equal to the amount our government currently spends on our nation's defense.  In fact, it will eventually grow larger than what our government spends on anything else today. It's a scenario that will swamp our federal and state budgets, and impose a vicious choice of either unprecedented tax hikes, overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts in our federal and state budgets.
To say it as plainly as I can, health care reform is the single most important thing we can do for America's long-term fiscal health. That is a fact.
And yet, as clear as it is that our system badly needs reform, reform is not inevitable.  There's a sense out there among some that, as bad as our current system may be, the devil we know is better than the devil we don't.  There is a fear of change – a worry that we may lose what works about our health care system while trying to fix what doesn't.
I understand that fear. I understand that cynicism. They are scars left over from past efforts at reform. Presidents have called for health care reform for nearly a century. Teddy Roosevelt called for it. Harry Truman called for it. Richard Nixon called for it. Jimmy Carter called for it. Bill Clinton called for it. But while significant individual reforms have been made – such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the children's health insurance program – efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down costs have largely failed.
Part of the reason is because the different groups involved – physicians, insurance companies, businesses, workers, and others – simply couldn't agree on the need for reform or what shape it would take.  And another part of the reason has been the fierce opposition fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists – opposition that has used fear tactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an attempt to socialize medicine.
Despite this long history of failure, I am standing here today because I think we are in a different time.  One sign that things are different is that just this past week, the Senate passed a bill that will protect children from the dangers of smoking – a reform the AMA has long championed – and one that went nowhere when it was proposed a decade ago. What makes this moment different is that this time – for the first time – key stakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform.  They are coming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health care community doing their part, ultimately, everyone will benefit.
And I want to commend the AMA, in particular, for offering to do your part to curb costs and achieve reform. A few weeks ago, you joined together with hospitals, labor unions, insurers, medical device manufacturers and drug companies to do something that would've been unthinkable just a few years ago – you promised to work together to cut national health care spending by two trillion dollars over the next decade, relative to what it would otherwise have been.  That will bring down costs, that will bring down premiums, and that's exactly the kind of cooperation we need.
The question now is, how do we finish the job?  How do we permanently bring down costs and make quality, affordable health care available to every American?
That's what I've come to talk about today.  We know the moment is right for health care reform.  We know this is an historic opportunity we've never seen before and may not see again.  But we also know that there are those who will try and scuttle this opportunity no matter what – who will use the same scare tactics and fear-mongering that's worked in the past.  They'll give dire warnings about socialized medicine and government takeovers; long lines and rationed care; decisions made by bureaucrats and not doctors.  We've heard it all before – and because these fear tactics have worked, things have kept getting worse.
So let me begin by saying this:  I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage – they like their plan and they value their relationship with their doctor.  And that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise:  If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor.  Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan.  Period. No one will take it away.  No matter what.  My view is that health care reform should be guided by a simple principle: fix what's broken and build on what works.
If we do that, we can build a health care system that allows you to be physicians instead of administrators and accountants; a system that gives Americans the best care at the lowest cost; a system that eases up the pressure on businesses and unleashes the promise of our economy, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, making take-home wages thousands of dollars higher, and growing our economy by tens of billions more every year. That's how we will stop spending tax dollars to prop up an unsustainable system, and start investing those dollars in innovations and advances that will make our health care system and our economy stronger.
That's what we can do with this opportunity.  That's what we must do with this moment.
Now, the good news is that in some instances, there is already widespread agreement on the steps necessary to make our health care system work better.
First, we need to upgrade our medical records by switching from a paper to an electronic system of record keeping. And we have already begun to do this with an investment we made as part of our Recovery Act.
It simply doesn't make sense that patients in the 21st century are still filling out forms with pens on papers that have to be stored away somewhere.  As Newt Gingrich has rightly pointed out, we do a better job tracking a FedEx package in this country than we do tracking a patient's health records. You shouldn't have to tell every new doctor you see about your medical history, or what prescriptions you're taking. You should not have to repeat costly tests. All of that information should be stored securely in a private medical record so that your information can be tracked from one doctor to another – even if you change jobs, even if you move, and even if you have to see a number of different specialists.
That will not only mean less paper pushing and lower administrative costs, saving taxpayers billions of dollars. It will also make it easier for physicians to do their jobs. It will tell you, the doctors, what drugs a patient is taking so you can avoid prescribing a medication that could cause a harmful interaction. It will help prevent the wrong dosages from going to a patient. And it will reduce medical errors that lead to 100,000 lives lost unnecessarily in our hospitals every year.
The second step that we can all agree on is to invest more in preventive care so that we can avoid illness and disease in the first place.  That starts with each of us taking more responsibility for our health and the health of our children. It means quitting smoking, going in for that mammogram or colon cancer screening. It means going for a run or hitting the gym, and raising our children to step away from the video games and spend more time playing outside.
It also means cutting down on all the junk food that is fueling an epidemic of obesity, putting far too many Americans, young and old, at greater risk of costly, chronic conditions. That's a lesson Michelle and I have tried to instill in our daughters with the White House vegetable garden that Michelle planted. And that's a lesson that we should work with local school districts to incorporate into their school lunch programs.
Building a health care system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseases will require all of us to do our part. It will take doctors telling us what risk factors we should avoid and what preventive measures we should pursue. And it will take employers following the example of places like Safeway that is rewarding workers for taking better care of their health while reducing health care costs in the process. If you're one of the three quarters of Safeway workers enrolled in their ""Healthy Measures"" program, you can get screened for problems like high cholesterol or high blood pressure. And if you score well, you can pay lower premiums. It's a program that has helped Safeway cut health care spending by 13 percent and workers save over 20 percent on their premiums. And we are open to doing more to help employers adopt and expand programs like this one.
Our federal government also has to step up its efforts to advance the cause of healthy living. Five of the costliest illnesses and conditions – cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, and strokes – can be prevented. And yet only a fraction of every health care dollar goes to prevention or public health.  That is starting to change with an investment we are making in prevention and wellness programs that can help us avoid diseases that harm our health and the health of our economy.
But as important as they are, investments in electronic records and preventive care are just preliminary steps.  They will only make a dent in the epidemic of rising costs in this country.
Despite what some have suggested, the reason we have these costs is not simply because we have an aging population.  Demographics do account for part of rising costs because older, sicker societies pay more on health care than younger, healthier ones. But what accounts for the bulk of our costs is the nature of our health care system itself – a system where we spend vast amounts of money on things that aren't making our people any healthier; a system that automatically equates more expensive care with better care.
A recent article in the New Yorker, for example, showed how McAllen, Texas is spending twice as much as El Paso County – not because people in McAllen are sicker and not because they are getting better care.  They are simply using more treatments – treatments they don't really need; treatments that, in some cases, can actually do people harm by raising the risk of infection or medical error.  And the problem is, this pattern is repeating itself across America. One Dartmouth study showed that you're no less likely to die from a heart attack and other ailments in a higher spending area than in a lower spending one.
There are two main reasons for this. The first is a system of incentives where the more tests and services are provided, the more money we pay. And a lot of people in this room know what I'm talking about.  It is a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care; that pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you can't spend much time with each; and gives you every incentive to order that extra MRI or EKG, even if it's not truly necessary. It is a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession – a calling – to a business.
That is not why you became doctors. That is not why you put in all those hours in the Anatomy Suite or the O.R. That is not what brings you back to a patient's bedside to check in or makes you call a loved one to say it'll be fine. You did not enter this profession to be bean-counters and paper-pushers. You entered this profession to be healers – and that's what our health care system should let you be.
That starts with reforming the way we compensate our doctors and hospitals. We need to bundle payments so you aren't paid for every single treatment you offer a patient with a chronic condition like diabetes, but instead are paid for how you treat the overall disease. We need to create incentives for physicians to team up – because we know that when that happens, it results in a healthier patient. We need to give doctors bonuses for good health outcomes – so that we are not promoting just more treatment, but better care.
And we need to rethink the cost of a medical education, and do more to reward medical students who choose a career as a primary care physicians and who choose to work in underserved areas instead of a more lucrative path. That's why we are making a substantial investment in the National Health Service Corps that will make medical training more affordable for primary care doctors and nurse practitioners so they aren't drowning in debt when they enter the workforce.
The second structural reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medical information making its way to doctors and patients. We have the best medical schools, the most sophisticated labs, and the most advanced training of any nation on the globe. Yet we are not doing a very good job harnessing our collective knowledge and experience on behalf of better medicine. Less than one percent of our health care spending goes to examining what treatments are most effective. And even when that information finds its way into journals, it can take up to 17 years to find its way to an exam room or operating table.
As a result, too many doctors and patients are making decisions without the benefit of the latest research. A recent study, for example, found that only half of all cardiac guidelines are based on scientific evidence. Half. That means doctors may be doing a bypass operation when placing a stent is equally effective, or placing a stent when adjusting a patient's drugs and medical management is equally effective – driving up costs without improving a patient's health.
So, one thing we need to do is figure out what works, and encourage rapid implementation of what works into your practices. That's why we are making a major investment in research to identify the best treatments for a variety of ailments and conditions.
Let me be clear: identifying what works is not about dictating what kind of care should be provided. It's about providing patients and doctors with the information they need to make the best medical decisions.
Still, even when we do know what works, we are often not making the most of it. That's why we need to build on the examples of outstanding medicine at places like the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where the quality of care for cystic fibrosis patients shot up after the hospital began incorporating suggestions from parents. And places like Tallahassee Memorial Health Care, where deaths were dramatically reduced with rapid response teams that monitored patients' conditions and ""multidisciplinary rounds"" with everyone from physicians to pharmacists. And places like the Geisinger Health system in rural Pennsylvania and the Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, where high-quality care is being provided at a cost well below average. These are islands of excellence that we need to make the standard in our health care system.
Replicating best practices. Incentivizing excellence. Closing cost disparities. Any legislation sent to my desk that does not achieve these goals does not earn the title of reform. But my signature on a bill is not enough. I need your help, doctors. To most Americans, you are the health care system. Americans – me included – just do what you recommend. That is why I will listen to you and work with you to pursue reform that works for you. And together, if we take all these steps, we can bring spending down, bring quality up, and save hundreds of billions of dollars on health care costs while making our health care system work better for patients and doctors alike.
Now, I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they are constantly looking over their shoulder for fear of lawsuits. Some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable.  That's a real issue. And while I'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards which I believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully harmed, I do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first, let doctors focus on practicing medicine, and encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines. That's how we can scale back the excessive defensive medicine reinforcing our current system of more treatment rather than better care.
These changes need to go hand-in-hand with other reforms. Because our health care system is so complex and medicine is always evolving, we need a way to continually evaluate how we can eliminate waste, reduce costs, and improve quality. That is why I am open to expanding the role of a commission created by a Republican Congress called the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission – which happens to include a number of physicians. In recent years, this commission proposed roughly $200 billion in savings that never made it into law. These recommendations have now been incorporated into our broader reform agenda, but we need to fast-track their proposals in the future so that we don't miss another opportunity to save billions of dollars, as we gain more information about what works and what doesn't in our health care system.
As we seek to contain the cost of health care, we must also ensure that every American can get coverage they can afford.   We must do so in part because it is in all of our economic interests. Each time an uninsured American steps foot into an emergency room with no way to reimburse the hospital for care, the cost is handed over to every American family as a bill  of about $1,000 that is reflected in higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher health care costs; a hidden tax that will be cut as we insure all Americans. And as we insure every young and healthy American, it will spread out risk for insurance companies, further reducing costs for everyone.
But alongside these economic arguments, there is another, more powerful one. It is simply this: We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women, and children. We are not a nation that lets hardworking families go without the coverage they deserve; or turns its back on those in need. We are a nation that cares for its citizens. We are a people who look out for one another. That is what makes this the United States of America.
So, we need to do a few things to provide affordable health insurance to every single American. The first thing we need to do is protect what's working in our health care system. Let me repeat – if you like your health care, the only thing reform will mean is your health care will cost less. If anyone says otherwise, they are either trying to mislead you or don't have their facts straight.
If you don't like your health coverage or don't have any insurance, you will have a chance to take part in what we're calling a Health Insurance Exchange. This Exchange will allow you to one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose a plan that's best for you and your family – just as federal employees can do, from a postal worker to a Member of Congress. You will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages, but every plan would offer an affordable, basic package. And one of these options needs to be a public option that will give people a broader range of choices and inject competition into the health care market so that force waste out of the system and keep the insurance companies honest.
Now, I know there's some concern about a public option. In particular, I understand that you are concerned that today's Medicare rates will be applied broadly in a way that means our cost savings are coming off your backs.  These are legitimate concerns, but ones, I believe, that can be overcome. As I stated earlier, the reforms we propose are to reward best practices, focus on patient care, not the current piece-work reimbursement. What we seek is more stability and a health care system on a sound financial footing. And these reforms need to take place regardless of what happens with a public option. With reform, we will ensure that you are being reimbursed in a thoughtful way tied to patient outcomes instead of relying on yearly negotiations about the Sustainable Growth Rate formula that's based on politics and the state of the federal budget in any given year. The alternative is a world where health care costs grow at an unsustainable rate, threatening your reimbursements and the stability of our health care system.
What are not legitimate concerns are those being put forward claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payer system. I'll be honest. There are countries where a single-payer system may be working. But I believe – and I've even taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief – that it is important for us to build on our traditions here in the United States.  So, when you hear the naysayers claim that I'm trying to bring about government-run health care, know this – they are not telling the truth.
What I am trying to do – and what a public option will help do – is put affordable health care within reach for millions of Americans. And to help ensure that everyone can afford the cost of a health care option in our Exchange, we need to provide assistance to families who need it. That way, there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain uninsured.
Indeed, it is because I am confident in our ability to give people the ability to get insurance that I am open to a system where every American bears responsibility for owning health insurance, so long as we provide a hardship waiver for those who still can't afford it. The same is true for employers. While I believe every business has a responsibility to provide health insurance for its workers, small businesses that cannot afford it should receive an exemption. And small business workers and their families will be able to seek coverage in the Exchange if their employer is not able to provide it.
Insurance companies have expressed support for the idea of covering the uninsured – and I welcome their willingness to engage constructively in the reform debate. But what I refuse to do is simply create a system where insurance companies have more customers on Uncle Sam's dime, but still fail to meet their responsibilities. That is why we need to end the practice of denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. The days of cherry-picking who to cover and who to deny – those days are over.
This is personal for me. I will never forget watching my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final days, worrying about whether her insurer would claim her illness was a preexisting condition so it could get out of providing coverage. Changing the current approach to preexisting conditions is the least we can do – for my mother and every other mother, father, son, and daughter, who has suffered under this practice. And it will put health care within reach for millions of Americans.
Now, even if we accept all of the economic and moral reasons for providing affordable coverage to all Americans, there is no denying that it will come at a cost – at least in the short run. But it is a cost that will not – I repeat, not – add to our deficits. Health care reform must be and will be deficit neutral in the next decade.
There are already voices saying the numbers don't add up. They are wrong. Here's why. Making health care affordable for all Americans will cost somewhere on the order of one trillion dollars over the next ten years. That sounds like a lot of money – and it is. But remember: it is less than we are projected to spend on the war in Iraq. And also remember: failing to reform our health care system in a way that genuinely reduces cost growth will cost us trillions of dollars more in lost economic growth and lower wages.
That said, let me explain how we will cover the price tag. First, as part of the budget that was passed a few months ago, we've put aside $635 billion over ten years in what we are calling a Health Reserve Fund.  Over half of that amount – more than $300 billion – will come from raising revenue by doing things like modestly limiting the tax deductions the wealthiest Americans can take to the same level it was at the end of the Reagan years. Some are concerned this will dramatically reduce charitable giving, but statistics show that's not true, and the best thing for our charities is the stronger economy that we will build with health care reform.
But we cannot just raise revenues. We also have to make spending cuts in part by examining inefficiencies in the Medicare program. There will be a robust debate about where these cuts should be made, and I welcome that debate. But here's where I think these cuts should be made. First, we should end overpayments to Medicare Advantage. Today, we are paying Medicare Advantage plans much more than we pay for traditional Medicare services. That's a good deal for insurance companies, but not the American people. That's why we need to introduce competitive bidding into the Medicare Advantage program, a program under which private insurance companies offer Medicare coverage. That will save $177 billion over the next decade.
Second, we need to use Medicare reimbursements to reduce preventable hospital readmissions. Right now, almost 20 percent of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals are readmitted within a month, often because they are not getting the comprehensive care they need. This puts people at risk and drives up costs. By changing how Medicare reimburses hospitals, we can discourage them from acting in a way that boosts profits, but drives up costs for everyone else. That will save us $25 billion over the next decade.
Third, we need to introduce generic biologic drugs into the marketplace. These are drugs used to treat illnesses like anemia. But right now, there is no pathway at the FDA for approving generic versions of these drugs. Creating such a pathway will save us billions of dollars. And we can save another roughly $30 billion by getting a better deal for our poorer seniors while asking our well-off seniors to pay a little more for their drugs.
So, that's the bulk of what's in the Health Reserve Fund. I have also proposed saving another $313 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending in several other ways. One way is by adjusting Medicare payments to reflect new advances and productivity gains in our economy. Right now, Medicare payments are rising each year by more than they should. These adjustments will create incentives for providers to deliver care more effectively, and save us roughly $109 billion in the process.
Another way we can achieve savings is by reducing payments to hospitals for treating uninsured people. I know hospitals rely on these payments now because of the large number of uninsured patients they treat. But as the number of uninsured people goes down with our reforms, the amount we pay hospitals to treat uninsured people should go down, as well. Reducing these payments gradually as more and more people have coverage will save us over $106 billion, and we'll make sure the difference goes to the hospitals that most need it.
We can also save about $75 billion through more efficient purchasing of prescription drugs. And we can  save about one billion more by rooting out waste, abuse, and fraud throughout our health care system so that no one is charging more for a service than it's worth or charging a dime for a service they did not provide.
But let me be clear: I am committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our senior citizens. In fact, these proposals will actually extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 7 years and reduce premiums for Medicare beneficiaries by roughly $43 billion over 10 years. And I'm working with AARP to uphold that commitment.
Altogether, these savings mean that we have put about $950 billion on the table – not counting some of the longer-term savings that will come about from reform – taking us almost all the way to covering the full cost of health care reform. In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to working with Congress to make up the difference so that health care reform is fully paid for – in a real, accountable way. And let me add that this does not count some of the longer-term savings that will come about from health care reform. By insisting that reform be deficit neutral over the next decade and by making the reforms that will help slow the growth rate of health care costs over coming decades, we can look forward to faster economic growth, higher living standards, and falling, not rising, budget deficits.
I know people are cynical we can do this. I know there will be disagreements about how to proceed in the days ahead. But I also know that we cannot let this moment pass us by.
The other day, my friend, Congressman Earl Blumenauer, handed me a magazine with a special issue titled, ""The Crisis in American Medicine."" One article notes ""soaring charges."" Another warns about the ""volume of utilization of services."" And another asks if we can find a ""better way [than fee-for-service] for paying for medical care."" It speaks to many of the challenges we face today. The thing is, this special issue was published by Harper's Magazine in October of 1960.
Members of the American Medical Association – my fellow Americans – I am here today because I do not want our children and their children to still be speaking of a crisis in American medicine fifty years from now.  I do not want them to still be suffering from spiraling costs we did not stem, or sicknesses we did not cure. I do not want them to be burdened with massive deficits we did not curb or a worsening economy we did not rebuild.
I want them to benefit from a health care system that works for all of us; where families can open a doctor's bill without dreading what's inside; where parents are taking their kids to get regular checkups and testing themselves for preventable ailments; where parents are feeding their kids healthier food and kids are exercising more; where patients are spending more time with doctors and doctors can pull up on a computer all the medical information and latest research they'd ever want to meet that patient's needs; where orthopedists and nephrologists and oncologists are all working together to treat a single human being; where what's best about America's health care system has become the hallmark of America's health care system.
That is the health care system we can build. That is the future within our reach. And if we are willing to come together and bring about that future, then we will not only make Americans healthier and not only unleash America's economic potential, but we will reaffirm the ideals that led you into this noble profession, and build a health care system that lets all Americans heal. Thank you.

Trujillo is a savior. Johnny Odom, at 57, has congestive heart failure, diabetes, kidney failure, high blood pressure, gout, high cholesterol and blindness in one eye. His daughter, Tonia, 35, has rheumatoid arthritis, and her 10-year-old son has asthma, a seizure disorder, high blood pressure, prediabetes and sleep apnea.
Dr. Trujillo, a primary care physician at the Family Medicine Center at Duke University, takes care of them all, coordinating the care they receive from various specialists via electronic records and e-mail. Ms. Odom uses the clinic’s online health portal to get the family’s medical information, make appointments and check the lab results Dr. Trujillo sends her.
Ms. Odom is especially pleased with the time the doctor takes to explain their medical problems and motivate her son to walk every day, which helps him maintain his weight and lower his blood pressure so he no longer needs medication.
At the same time, the extraordinary care the family receives, which is financed by Medicare and Medicaid, saves money by preventing medical complications and keeping the Odoms out of the hospital.
The Duke clinic represents a promising approach to delivering better health care: the so-called medical home. As President Obama and Congress try to create a national system that provides better care for more people at lower cost, you are likely to hear a lot more about this idea.
The term, coined by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1967, is admittedly confusing. It does not mean a return to house calls. Nor need it apply only to people with complex health problems like those of the Odom family.
Rather, it is an approach in which each person has a primary care doctor who heads a team of professionals  — perhaps including a physician assistant, a nurse practitioner, a dietitian, a social worker and a pharmacist — to provide round-the-clock access to care.
It is unlike managed care, in which primary doctors act as gatekeepers to specialists and the overriding goal is not managing care but managing costs. In a medical home, the family doctor helps patients get specialty care when they need it and, through electronic records, keeps careful track of treatments and informs specialists of the patients’ progress. The connections between the professionals who work on each case are seamless and convenient. Doctors and patients have easy access to medical information, and patients with chronic ailments are called regularly to reinforce treatment regimens and see how they are doing.
“I love this clinic,” Ms. Odom told me in an interview. “Everyone’s so friendly and knows you by your first name. I never have to wait more than a few minutes, and there’s a board that tells you how long the wait is.”
She added: “I feel really cared for. If my arthritis flares up, someone gets back to me the same day with the prescription I need. Dr. T taught us about heart failure and how to recognize danger signs so I know when to get my father to the emergency room.”
Focus on Prevention
There are now medical homes in more than a dozen states, many of them serving Medicaid patients. Their proponents say they save money because they focus on prevention and prompt attention to emerging problems, which can prevent costly complications. Some major health insurers are also testing patient-centered medical homes.
Medicare, until recently a holdout, now has a medical home demonstration project under way. If successful, it could have two huge benefits: it could help the Medicare system remain solvent as the older population grows, and it could result in coordinated care that emphasizes wellness rather than a fragmented, difficult-to-navigate system based on costly acute care.
An 81-year-old friend with multiple health problems complained recently that she was seeing an orthopedist, a rheumatologist, an oncologist, an ophthalmologist and an endocrinologist but had no doctor to oversee and coordinate her overall care.
The medical home concept has won the support of the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Osteopathic Association, among others. Bipartisan legislation in Congress would support medical homes in the Medicaid and children’s health insurance programs, which are jointly financed by the states and the federal government.
In The Journal of the American Medical Association last month, Dr. Diane R. Rittenhouse, a family and community medicine specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, and Stephen M. Shortell, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote that in a patient-centered medical home, care was tailored “to meet the needs and preferences of patients.” Rather than passive recipients, patients would be “more active, prepared and knowledgeable participants in their care.”
Having a continuous healing relationship with a personal physician has been shown in a review of 40 studies to significantly improve health outcomes.
The Whole Patient
Another virtue of the medical home is an emphasis on the whole patient and the patient’s environment, rather than a specific disease or body part. Patients, doctors and families work together to make health care more effective and reduce its costs.
Dr. Atul Grover, an assistant vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said in an interview that the medical home approach could revitalize student interest in primary care, which has been hemorrhaging doctors as their workloads increase and incomes and professional satisfaction shrink relative to those of specialists like cardiologists and orthopedists.
“The incentives in our current payment system are at odds with efforts to increase our focus on prevention, disease management and other aspects of patient-centered care,” Dr. Grover said. “Procedures are often reimbursed at a much higher level than cognitive services.
“If a physician spends 10 minutes intubating a patient in a hospital, that physician may be reimbursed more than a physician who spent twice as much time taking a patient history and creating a treatment plan.”
Dr. Shortell said the medical home concept required a new payment system, like “a single payment for both doctors and hospitals that gives them an incentive to work together to keep patients well.” Electronic health records, vital to the effectiveness of a medical home, are especially useful in rural areas where practitioners can be connected in a “virtual medical home,” Dr. Shortell said.
Dr. J. Lloyd Michener, chairman of community and family medicine at Duke, said that in the future, “we will have to train doctors to be members of teams —  both within the office, where people are seen before they get sick, and within the community, to help create healthier environments.”

The cost will almost certainly be at least $1 trillion over the next decade and perhaps much more, depending on how generous the reform might be.
President Obama is right to insist that reform be fully paid for over the next decade lest it drive up the federal deficit and lead to higher interest rates that might deepen the recession. That means either cutting spending or raising additional money.
Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has decreed that reform must be financed entirely by savings or revenues within the health care system. He believes  that that would force greater efficiencies from a notoriously wasteful enterprise. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democrat who is chairman of the committee, seems inclined to accept that notion to win Republican votes for a filibuster-proof majority.
Our preference would be to extract savings from the bloated, inefficient health care system — but also to raise revenues from a wider pool, preferably from well-to-do Americans who could be taxed more for a badly needed reform that would benefit all Americans.
The first task is to find savings. Some respected analysts suggest that as much as 30 percent of all health care spending in this country — some $700 billion a year — may be wasted on tests and treatments that do not improve the health of the recipients. If even half that money could be recaptured, the amount saved would be more than enough to finance health care reforms.
Overspending, however, permeates the system and would be devilishly difficult to eliminate in any systematic manner that reaped savings within the decade. Most of the truly “game-changing” innovations that could slow the rate of increase in health care costs — electronic medical records, research comparing the effectiveness of treatments, restructuring the way doctors organize themselves — will take years to affect costs and quality.
Still, it is important to push ahead quickly. Even if the benefits won’t show up for two or three decades, it is imperative to slow the rise in costs to a more affordable rate. And some respected analysts believe the big long-term reforms could yield some relatively quick savings.
Meanwhile, it will be important to get some guaranteed fast savings from the health care industries by cutting and reallocating hundreds of billions of dollars from projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid, as the Obama administration has proposed and Congress is considering. Just to be sure, Congress ought to establish a fail-safe mechanism that could impose additional cuts after a few years if savings are less than projected.
Even with all the cuts people are considering, new fees or taxes will almost certainly be necessary. Most health economists believe that the current tax exemption for employer-provided health benefits should be capped or eliminated. They say it is regressive and encourages generous policies that can lead to excessive use of medical care. A cap might make sense and would draw revenues from within the health care system. But surely it would be wise to cast a wider net — taxing products that are bad for one’s health, such as sugared drinks and alcohol, or limiting itemized deductions for wealthy Americans as Mr. Obama has suggested.
Any talk of new taxes provokes criticism and doubt that the nation can afford to reform the health care system in the midst of a deep recession. But the president is right, as he told a town hall meeting in Virginia recently, that “the costs of inaction, of not doing anything, are even greater.”
The nation can either make the hard choices needed to reform health care in the next decade or watch during that time as costs continue to soar, millions more people lose their health insurance and individuals and families face rising premiums and greater cost-sharing as employers shift more of the burden or drop their coverage.

Shriver III examined 70-year-old Eleanor L. Riley one recent morning, he seemed in no hurry. He asked about her phlebitis and her gall bladder, and whether her gout was acting up. They discussed her blood pressure readings and whether she was getting any exercise.
“I surprise my patients by asking, ‘Is there anything else you want to talk about today?’ ” said Dr. Shriver, chief of a clinic near Seattle run by Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. “They’ve never heard a doctor say that.”
Dr. Shriver has the time because Group Health, one of the country’s few surviving health insurance cooperatives, has recently embraced electronic medical records and a collaborative model of primary care, allowing him to practice proactive medicine for the first time in years.
On Capitol Hill, those innovations have made Group Health a prototype for a political compromise that could unclog health care negotiations in the Senate and lead to a bipartisan deal. After a month of brainstorming, including briefings from Group Health executives, the Senate Finance Committee seems poised to propose private-sector insurance cooperatives — instead of a new government health plan — as its primary mechanism for stoking competition and slowing the growth of medical costs.
But state officials say Group Health’s impact on holding down costs has been mixed. And its successes may have less to do with its governance — by a board that is elected by patients — than with its ownership of a vast network of clinics and specialty care centers.
Above all, Group Health’s physicians are paid  a salary and can earn bonuses of up to 20 percent for high-quality performance. Unlike most doctors, who are paid by the visit or procedure, they have little incentive to churn patients through and order unnecessary tests and operations.
At Group Health, doctors are rewarded for consulting by telephone and secure e-mail, which allows for longer appointments. Patients are assigned a team of primary care practitioners who are responsible for their well-being. Medical practices, and insurance coverage decisions, are driven by the company’s own research into which drugs and procedures are most effective.
As Congress and the White House debate a national health care overhaul, many in Washington agree that one reason health premiums have grown at four times the rate of inflation this decade is a dearth of competition. In 40 of 42 states studied by the American Medical Association last year, the two largest health insurers claimed at least half of all enrollment.
The question is how best to invigorate the system. Republicans and some moderate Democrats are concerned that competition from a government-run insurance plan would eventually drive private companies out of business and leave government as the sole insurer.
If the bill now being finalized by the Finance Committee includes cooperatives, it could set up a confrontation with the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has written legislation to create a government plan along the lines of Medicare.
House Democrats also prefer a public plan, as does President Obama. But Mr. Obama has signaled that he might settle for cooperatives if it would gain Republican support for the broader legislation.
There is much about the Group Health model that Congress and the White House would like to replicate. Whether that requires a cooperative structure is open to debate.
A number of company officials acknowledged that it is Group Health’s ability to directly manage its doctors that really drives innovation. The cooperative structure’s primary contribution, they said, is to create a consumerist ethos that keeps the company focused on patient care.
“There’s a kind of accountability to the patients in our system,” said Scott Armstrong, president of Group Health. “And when you bring the principles of a cooperative to bear, patients feel responsibility for holding the system together and for their own health.”
But Carolyn A. Watts, a health economist at the University of Washington, said the cooperative structure made little difference. “In the end, it’s not about who owns the place,” she said. “It’s about the incentives.”
Technically, Group Health Cooperative was misnamed when it was founded by trade unionists and Grange members in 1947. Structured as a not-for-profit corporation, its revenues ($2.6 billion last year) are reinvested rather than distributed among members. But it is governed like a cooperative — and calls itself one — because its board consists of and is elected by members.
With 550,000 enrollees in Washington, Group Health is the smallest of three major insurers in the state, with a 9 percent market share. It often does raise premiums by less than its competitors, but that does not mean the increases have been insignificant. Annual increases for individual policies have averaged 12.3 percent since 2000, peaking at 24.2 percent in 2003.
Mike Kreidler, formerly a Group Health optometrist and now Washington’s insurance commissioner, said governance by consumers had sometimes translated into generous benefits. “They haven’t had the dramatic impact on cost in this market that you might have anticipated,” he said.
Group Health is a rare survivor among the hundreds of rural health insurance cooperatives that formed in the 1930s and 1940s in the face of fierce resistance from organized medicine. But there is a feeling in Seattle that it has endured only by becoming more like its competitors.
In the 1980s, it ended the practice of charging all enrollees the same premiums, regardless of their health status, and it has since introduced deductibles, co-payments and out-of-network benefits. Only seven-tenths of 1 percent of enrollees voted in the last board election.
Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who first proposed cooperatives as a compromise last month, said the Finance Committee was debating how a national network might be structured and how much seed money would be needed for state and regional branches. Mr. Conrad has said it would take up to $4 billion, while others have projected $10 billion.
Mr. Conrad estimates that cooperatives would need at least half a million members, about the size of Group Health in its 62nd year, to wield meaningful leverage. That scale will be possible, he said, if the Democrats succeed in bringing tens of millions of the uninsured into the market by mandating coverage and subsidizing premiums.
But supporters of a public plan argue that it will be a challenge to form pools that large any time soon. They predict that cooperatives will become dumping grounds for the sickest patients, and that they will have difficulty forming networks of physicians.
“The idea that these things will spontaneously erupt all over the country is just completely a dream,” said Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.

Mr. Obama said doctors, nurses, hospitals, drug companies and AARP had supported efforts to overhaul  health care.
While it is true the American Medical Association has endorsed a bill drafted by House Democratic leaders, a half-dozen state medical societies have sharply criticized  provisions that would establish a new government-run health insurance plan.
Likewise, Mr. Obama said Medicare could save large amounts of money by creating “an independent group of doctors and medical experts who are empowered to eliminate waste and inefficiency” and hold down the annual increases in payments to health care providers.
Far from supporting this proposal, the American Hospital Association is urging hospital executives to lobby against it.
Of the proposed new cost-control agency, Mr. Obama said: “It’s not going to reduce Medicare benefits. What it’s going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they’re more efficient.”
Hospitals say the cuts could indeed cut  services  in some rural areas and from teaching hospitals, which receive extra  payments because of  higher costs.
In seeking to portray health legislation as bipartisan, Mr. Obama said that 160 Republican amendments were adopted in a bill approved last week by the Senate health committee.  Republicans said many of the amendments involved technical provisions and did not alter the fundamental features of the bill.
The president said that health insurance companies were making “record profits.” America’s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for insurers, contends that “for every $1 spent on health care in America, approximately one penny goes to health plans’ profits.”
Mr. Obama said he was not proposing to ration care, but just wanted to coordinate it better. For example, he said, he wants to eliminate repetitious tests ordered by different doctors for the same patient.
Electronic medical records and health information technology, championed by Mr. Obama, could reduce such duplication. But, under his plan, it is not clear who would take responsibility for patients and coordinate care in traditional fee-for-service medicine.
The president continued to take credit for deficit reduction by making a claim that has been challenged by many  experts.
“If we had done nothing, if you had the same old budget as opposed to the changes we made,” the deficit over the next 10 years would be $2.2 trillion greater, the president said.
In fact, $1.5 trillion of those “savings” are mainly based on an assumption that the United States would have had as many troops in Iraq in 10 years as it did when Mr. Obama took office. But  before leaving office, President George W. Bush  signed an agreement with Baghdad mandating the withdrawal of all American forces within three years.
So Mr. Obama is claiming credit for not spending money that, under the policy he inherited from Mr. Bush, would never have been spent in the first place.

Over the years, I have whittled down the number of questions, from the exhausting repertoire I memorized as a medical student to the streamlined clinical checklist I use today.
Some of the questions I ask are generic: What brings you here today? What medications are you taking? Some are specialized: Was your liver transplant done “piggy back”? Have you had any episodes of rejection? But a few of the questions have nothing to do with the work I do or the care I am trained to offer. Rather, they are questions about being well and preventing disease: Are you exercising? Do you smoke? Have you had a mammogram?
For years I believed that this last group of questions was a clinician’s equivalent of performing a good deed. After all, discussing such topics could help a patient avoid the kind of potentially preventable diseases I had seen other patients suffer from. And since I knew that countless health care resources had been depleted while caring for those patients, I also couldn’t help but feel as if bringing up these questions with patients, however briefly, was like contributing to some greater public good. Any kind of preventive care that I could offer as a doctor, I believed, had to save money.
But it turns out that at least one of my assumptions — that I could help to save money — was erroneous. Sort of.
In the enormous pie that makes up health care expenditures, only 1 to 3 percent can be attributed to preventive interventions. The miniscule size of this share is due in part to the fact that very few clinical preventive services actually result in savings. In fact, the data for savings is so lackluster that some economists have argued that it is less cost-effective to prevent illness than it is to simply let people get sick. Other economists have taken that argument even further, contending that preventive care adds to societal costs by extending lives and thus the time we must care for people (though one would hope that costly treatments might result in the same “problem”).
But according to Dr. Steven H. Woolf, a professor of family medicine at the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and a leading expert on preventive care, all of these assertions are premised on the wrong question. In a commentary published earlier this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Woolf maintains that the economic argument for disease prevention rests not on how much people save but on how much value they gain for each dollar spent.
“Health is a good, like food or gas,” Dr. Woolf said. “When you go to a grocery store or gas up a car, you don’t ask whether it will produce a net savings. You don’t expect the cashier to give you money back. The more appropriate question is whether we are getting good value for the money we’re spending.”
To help determine value, Dr. Woolf utilizes a unit of measurement — the Quality Adjusted Life Year, or QALY. QALY has been used historically in studies to assess the relative value of different interventions, with each intervention carrying a “price tag” or a rough estimate of the cost to save a comparable year of life.
Viewed in terms of QALY value then, there are indeed some clinical preventive services that confer few health benefits for the amount of money spent. But several preventive interventions turn out to be downright bargains. Childhood immunizations and smoking cessation cost so little per QALY (less than $5,000 per QALY gained) that they may actually end up yielding net savings. Other preventive services, like taking aspirin daily if you are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, cost roughly a third to a fifth of more expensive disease interventions that are now routinely paid for, like angioplasty, the procedure that widens or “roto-rooters” narrowed heart vessels.
There is also value added beyond these cost efficiency calculations. Last fall, the National Commission on Prevention Priorities found that by increasing just five preventive services, clinicians could save more than 100,000 lives per year. These services include breast cancer screening in women 40 and older, flu immunizations in adults 50 and over, colorectal cancer screening in adults 50 and over, smoking cessation counseling, and a daily aspirin in high risk cardiovascular patients.
Much of the responsibility of these preventive services currently rests on clinicians’ shoulders. This focus has contributed in part to the poor data regarding preventive medicine’s results, since relying on clinical settings alone is a relatively inefficient way of changing health behaviors and preventing illness. “Putting it all on doctors and the clinical setting is not a powerful formula,” Dr. Woolf noted. “What is unique about prevention is that so much is happening outside of the clinical setting. Good preventive care requires breaking down the boundaries and getting beyond the constraints of a doctor’s appointment. It requires thinking more broadly in terms of a community-based approach.”
It is in this way that preventive medicine offers an additional public good: the potential to strengthen and broaden how we define the patient-doctor relationship.
To that end, Dr. Woolf and his colleagues recently spearheaded a program using electronic medical records to link nine physician practices to several community services that offered telephone and group counseling services. “If their patients who smoked were interested,” Dr. Woolf said, “doctors could click a button and auto-enroll the patient with the state’s quit smoking line. Two days later, those patients would receive a call to enroll.” Dr. Woolf’s group created similar electronic links to Weight Watchers and to Alcoholics Anonymous.
These quick and reliable connections between physicians and community-based programs resulted in significant improvements for patients and a higher rate of referrals from doctors. “It’s not feasible for doctors to offer intensive smoking cessation counseling in 15 minutes and to be there through the whole process,” Dr. Woolf said. “The barriers to change are at home, work, school, the store. That’s where people need help with behavior change. The last physician or emergency room visit only goes so far.” Such connections are even more critical for patients with chronic diseases, since these individuals often have complicated care plans and can benefit tremendously from increased coordination with preventive and caregiving resources in the community.
All of these links, however, require additional outside support, at least initially. “What is needed is a third party,” Dr. Woolf said, “individuals apart from the busy physicians or busy community organizations who can work out the logistical details. Once you have done that, it takes literally seconds to connect the dots for patients.”
But as long as the focus is on savings and not on value, such support is not likely to be forthcoming, and preventive care stands to remain a nearly negligible part of our health care expenditures.
“Community health and wellness have been pushed aside in the health care reform debate partly because we have been focused on net savings, not value,” Dr. Woolf observed. “That analysis has not been favorable with preventive medicine, so people continue to get highly expensive studies and procedures that are ineffective, even though we have cost-effective public health interventions at our fingertips.”
“It’s as if our house is going up in flames,” Dr. Woolf continued. “There is one room, filled with explosives, that hasn’t yet caught on fire. But people are hesitating to put out the fire because they believe they don’t have the data.”

One is to cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans. The other is to absorb the enormous cost of that plan — which could reach $1 trillion over 10 years — without increasing the budget deficit in the next decade or setting the nation on a course that will drive up deficits later.
It is easier to see how to accomplish the first task than the second. But Congress should not slow the push for near-universal coverage while it looks for ways to apply the brakes to the growth in costs. We can be virtually certain that the reforms enacted will be deficit-neutral over the first 10 years. President Obama and Democratic leaders will find cuts in Medicare and raise sufficient taxes to offset the initial cost of insurance expansion.
It is much harder to find ways to slow inflation in health care costs. Peter Orszag, Mr. Obama’s budget director, has been searching for what he calls “game changers” that can “bend down the cost curve” in coming years. The question is how well he and Congressional champions of health care reform have succeeded.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT The skyrocketing cost of health care is driving up federal deficits, threatening to bankrupt Medicare, forcing employers to cut or drop benefits,  and leaving workers and their families with unaffordable bills. Even a relatively small reduction in the average annual growth rate over the next decade — from, say, 6.2 percent to 4.7 percent — could save more than $2 trillion for the health care system and hundreds or thousands of dollars for the average family. There is an enormous amount of money in the health care system, much of it spent on tests and procedures that do not improve health. It should be possible to wring out some of that spending.
HOW CAN WE JUDGE SUCCESS? Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, testified in mid-July that he saw no fundamental changes offered by the bills then emerging that would reduce the trajectory of federal health spending significantly. The implication was that the pending bills could actually make deficits bigger after the initial break-even decade. That’s because covering the uninsured would increase federal spending and a high rate of medical inflation applied to that larger base would make future deficits worse. However, Mr. Elmendorf was looking only at bills that had cleared committees, which did not include one still being fashioned by the pivotal Senate Finance Committee.
Senator Max Baucus, the Democrat who heads that committee, revealed last week that the C.B.O. had evaluated a draft of his bill and concluded that it would cover 95 percent of all Americans, for a cost below $900 billion, and would actually start reducing the deficit in 2019. That is better than the administration’s goal of being  deficit-neutral in that final year, but we will not know for sure until the C.B.O. issues a verdict on a final bill.
The budget office provides vitally important guidance to Congress, but focuses primarily on how new legislation might affect federal spending and federal deficits. The office gives only a cursory glance at how reforms might cut costs for the overall system and yield savings for employers, families and state and local governments, the issue that concerns most people.
Moreover, the office makes middle-of-the road estimates of cost and more pessimistic estimates of savings. That makes sense (lawmakers and government agencies routinely exaggerate the virtues of their proposals), but it makes it harder to evaluate proposed innovations.
Respected analysts who are not bound by the C.B.O.’s conservatism have projected significant savings from reforms that the C.B.O. scores poorly. The Commonwealth Fund, a research organization, and David Cutler, a Harvard health economist, separately estimate that an array of reforms could save the government hundreds of billions of dollars in the first decade and the health care system even more. These estimates, coming from advocates of reform, may be too rosy, but underscore the point that the C.B.O. may undervalue savings.
POTENTIAL GAME CHANGERS It seems hard to believe that over the long haul the introduction of electronic medical records will not save substantial money. It would help eliminate the costly repetition of tests, and prevent medication errors that harm patients and lead to costly hospitalization. But it takes money to get started (Mr. Obama’s stimulus package calls for $50 billion over five years) and time to overcome physicians’ reluctance. Savings in the first decade, if any, are likely to be small.
So, too, it seems likely that a stimulus investment of $1.1 billion in comparative effectiveness research to gauge which medicines and procedures work best is likely to pay off in future decades.
The approach has been wrongly portrayed as an effort by government bureaucrats to dictate “cookbook” medicine that will prevent doctors from doing what’s best for their patients and lead to rationing of care. More than 60 physicians’ groups have urged Congress to make comparative effectiveness research an important component of reform. They believe the information would help doctors and patients understand which treatments work best. In some cases, the better treatments might be more expensive, in others less. Either way, patients benefit.
And so it goes, through such ideas as changing Medicare’s payment incentives to encourage better care not just more care, and to encourage new arrangements of doctors and hospitals that might control costs and provide more coordinated care than the fee-for-service system does. All will take time to bear fruit.
TAXES One way to keep deficits in check would be to impose taxes within the health care system instead of more broadly, which should ensure that revenues increase at the rate of health care inflation. A tax on the value of an employer’s contribution to insurance could lead beneficiaries to choose cheaper policies and think twice before undergoing costly tests. We have been leery of recommending a tax that would affect many workers, but a tax on very expensive plans might make sense.
OTHER IDEAS The administration seems to have scoured the health policy literature for ideas, and its proposals reflect the thinking of the nation’s leading experts. Most of these ideas would first be tried on a small scale in Medicare — to see if they reduced costs while improving or at least maintaining the quality of care — before being adopted on a wide scale in government programs. Ideas that work for Medicare would presumably migrate out to the private sector.
We believe that some of the reforms in pending legislation could be strengthened. Both public and private insurance plans, for example, should be allowed — not forbidden — to base reimbursement policies on comparative effectiveness findings. But for the most part, the nation is embarking on a long-term experiment to see what works, so small-scale tests and pilot programs seem appropriate.
THE OVERSEER With so much uncertainty, it seems imperative to ensure that the government can change course rapidly to drop approaches that do not work and expand approaches that do. Proposals have been made to create an independent commission of experts, responsible to either the president or Congress, to perform this function at a step removed from the distorting influences of political lobbying.
It is a good idea, if the commission has sufficient power and resources to do an effective job. The panel should be directed to pursue both cost reduction and quality improvement. It should be given cost reduction targets to meet and a mandate to impose across-the-board cuts in Medicare if it falls short. It should have sufficient resources to evaluate and sponsor studies, a membership beholden to no special interest, and be insulated from political pressure by requiring Congress to approve or reject recommendations as a package, without fighting over individual items of interest to lobbyists.
WRONG-HEADED CRITICISM The Republican Party has started a campaign charging that President Obama is conducting a dangerous and reckless experiment in health care reform that will damage the economy, kill jobs, drive up health care costs, and harm patients. That is a bit hard to take after the Bush administration’s reckless squandering of government surpluses with tax cuts for wealthy Americans that cost $1.7 trillion over 10  years and an expensive Medicare drug benefit that is projected to cost almost $1 trillion over the next 10  years, without making provisions to cover their costs.
The Obama administration is paying meticulous attention to the need for offsets and new revenues. Most important, it seems headed in the right direction to finally slow the rate of growth in health care spending — a beast that has defied past efforts to tame it.

care dollars to pay for other
people’s abortions?
Abortion opponents say the legislation would use taxes to subsidize
insurance that could cover the procedure. Under the House bill, health
plans could choose to cover abortion, but they generally could not
use federal money to pay for the procedure and instead would have to
use money from the premiums paid by beneficiaries. Representative
Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, said the bill would keep
current restrictions on the use of federal money for abortion.
Will bureaucrats be allowed to
“pull the plug” on elderly sick
people, or euthanize them?
Will there be “death panels” to
decide who lives and dies?
No. AARP, the lobby for older Americans, says, “The rumors out there
are flat-out lies.” The House bill would provide Medicare coverage for
optional consultations with doctors who advise patients on
life-sustaining treatment and “end-of-life services,” including
hospice care.
Will undocumented immigrants
get taxpayer health benefits?
None of the major proposals in Congress would provide health
insurance to illegal immigrants.
Can the government deduct
money directly from bank
accounts to pay for health
care?
No. The House bill says that one of the goals for electronic health
records is to “enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow
automated reconciliation” between payment and billing. But it
describes common electronic banking transactions, not special
access privileges for the government.

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Portsmouth!  Thank you.  (Applause.) Thank you so much.  Everybody have a seat.  Oh, thank you so --
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!
THE PRESIDENT:  I love you back.  Thank you.  (Laughter.)  It is great to be back in Portsmouth.  (Applause.)  It's great to be back in New Hampshire.  I have to say, though, that most of my memories of this state are cold.  (Laughter.)  So it's good to be here in August.
There are a couple of people that I want to acknowledge who are here today, some special guests.  First of all, I want to thank principal Jeffrey Collins, and the Portsmouth students and faculty and staff.  (Applause.)  Thank you -- our host for today. Your own outstanding governor, John Lynch is here.  (Applause.)  And his wonderful wife, Dr. Susan Lynch is here, the First Lady of New Hampshire.  (Applause.)  Your United States senator, doing a great job, Jeanne Shaheen is here.  (Applause.)  The governor of the great state of Maine, and we are glad he's here in New Hampshire today, John Baldacci is here.  (Applause.)
Two of my favorite people, they are just taking Congress by storm, outstanding work -- Paul Hodes, Carol Shea-Porter -- give them a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  And we've got your own mayor, Tom Ferrini is here.  Where's Tom?  There he is.  (Applause.)
Now, I want to thank more than anybody, Lori, for that introduction, and for sharing her story with the rest of us.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Lori.  Lori's story is the same kind of story that I've read in letters, that I've heard in town hall meetings just like this one for the past five years.  In fact, some of you were in that town hall -- those town hall meetings, as I was traveling all throughout New Hampshire.  It's the story of hardworking Americans who are held hostage by health insurance companies that deny them coverage, or drop their coverage, or charge fees that they can't afford for care that they desperately need.
I believe it is wrong.  It is bankrupting families and businesses, and that's why we are going to pass health insurance reform in 2009.  (Applause.)
Now, this is obviously a tough time for families here in New Hampshire and all across America.  Six months ago, we were in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes.  I want you to remember what things were like in January and February.  We were losing about 700,000 jobs per month.  And economists of all stripes feared a second-coming of the Great Depression.  That was only six months ago.
That's why we acted as fast as we could to pass a Recovery Act that would stop the freefall.  And I want to make sure everybody understands what we did.  One-third of the money in the Recovery Act went to tax cuts that have already started showing up in the paychecks of about 500,000 working families in New Hampshire -- (applause) -- 500,000 families in New Hampshire.  We also cut taxes for small businesses on the investments that they make, and over 300 New Hampshire small businesses have qualified for new loans backed by the Recovery Act.
Now, that was a third -- that was a third of the Recovery Act.  Another third of the money in the Recovery Act is for emergency relief for folks who've borne the brunt of this recession.  So we've extended unemployment benefits for 20,000 New Hampshire residents.  (Applause.)  We've made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who rely on COBRA while they're looking for work.  (Applause.)  And for states that were facing historic budget shortfalls, we provided assistance that has saved the jobs of tens of thousands of workers who provided essential services -- like teachers and police officers.  (Applause.)  So it's prevented a lot of painful cuts in the state, but also a lot of painful state and local tax increases.
Now, the last third of the Recovery Act is for investments that are already putting people back to work.  These are jobs refurbishing bridges and pavement on I-95; or jobs at the community health centers here in Portsmouth that will be able to add nurses, and extend hours, and serve up to 500 new patients.  These are good jobs doing the work America needs done.  And, by the way, most of the work is being done by private, local businesses, because that's how we're going to grow this economy again.
So there is no doubt that the Recovery Act has helped put the brakes on this recession.  We just saw last Friday the job picture is beginning to turn.  We're starting to see signs that business investment is coming back.
But, New Hampshire, that doesn't mean we're out of the woods, and you know that.  It doesn't mean we can just sit back and do nothing while so many families are still struggling, because even before this recession hit we had an economy that was working pretty well for the wealthiest Americans, it was working pretty well for Wall Street bankers, it was working pretty well for big corporations, but it wasn't working so well for everybody else.  It was an economy of bubbles and busts.  And we can't go back to that kind of economy.
If we want this country to succeed in the 21st century -- and if we want our children to succeed in the 21st century -- then we're going to have to take the steps necessary to lay a new foundation for economic growth.  We need to build an economy that works for everybody, and not just some people.  (Applause.)
Now, health insurance reform is one of those pillars that we need to build up that new foundation.  I don't have to explain to you that nearly 46 million Americans don't have health insurance coverage today.  In the wealthiest nation on Earth, 46 million of our fellow citizens have no coverage.  They are just vulnerable. If something happens, they go bankrupt, or they don't get the care they need.
But it's just as important that we accomplish health insurance reform for the Americans who do have health insurance
-- (applause) -- because right now we have a health care system that too often works better for the insurance industry than it does for the American people.  And we've got to change that.  (Applause.)
Now, let me just start by setting the record straight on a few things I've been hearing out here -- (laughter) -- about reform.  Under the reform we're proposing, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.
You will not be waiting in any lines.  This is not about putting the government in charge of your health insurance.  I don't believe anyone should be in charge of your health insurance decisions but you and your doctor.  (Applause.)  I don't think government bureaucrats should be meddling, but I also don't think insurance company bureaucrats should be meddling.  That's the health care system I believe in.  (Applause.)
Now, we just heard from Lori about how she can't find an insurance company that will cover her because of her medical condition.  She's not alone.  A recent report actually shows that in the past three years, over 12 million Americans were discriminated against by insurance companies because of a preexisting condition.  Either the insurance company refused to cover the person, or they dropped their coverage when they got sick and they needed it most, or they refused to cover a specific illness or condition, or they charged higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.  No one holds these companies accountable for these practices.
And I have to say, this is personal for Lori but it's also personal for me.  I talked about this when I was campaigning up here in New Hampshire.  I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment.  And by the way, this was because the insurance company was arguing that somehow she should have known that she had cancer when she took her new job -- even though it hadn't been diagnosed yet.  So if it could happen to her, it could happen to any one of us.
And I've heard from so many Americans who have the same worries.  One woman testified that an insurance company would not cover her internal organs because of an accident she had when she was five years old.  Think about that -- that covers a lot of stuff.  (Laughter.)  They're only going to cover your skin.  (Laughter.)  Dermatology, that's covered; nothing else.  (Laughter.)
Another lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because the insurance company discovered he had gall stones that he hadn't known about when he applied for insurance.  Now, that is wrong, and that will change when we pass health care reform.  That is going to be a priority.  (Applause.)
Under the reform we're proposing, insurance companies will be prohibited from denying coverage because of a person's medical history.  Period.  (Applause.)  They will not be able to drop your coverage if you get sick.  (Applause.)  They will not be able to water down your coverage when you need it.  (Applause.)  Your health insurance should be there for you when it counts -- not just when you're paying premiums, but when you actually get sick.  And it will be when we pass this plan.  (Applause.)
Now, when we pass health insurance reform, insurance companies will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime.  And we will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because no one in America should go broke because they get sick.  (Applause.)
And finally -- this is important -- we will require insurance companies to cover routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies -- (applause) -- because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and prostate cancer on the front end.  That makes sense, it saves lives; it also saves money -- and we need to save money in this health care system.
So this is what reform is about.  For all the chatter and the yelling and the shouting and the noise, what you need to know is this:  If you don't have health insurance, you will finally have quality, affordable options once we pass reform.  (Applause.)  If you do have health insurance, we will make sure that no insurance company or government bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.  And we will do this without adding to our deficit over the next decade, largely by cutting out the waste and insurance company giveaways in Medicare that aren't making any of our seniors healthier.  (Applause.)  Right. (Laughter.)
Now, before I start taking questions, let me just say there's been a long and vigorous debate about this, and that's how it should be.  That's what America is about, is we have a vigorous debate.  That's why we have a democracy.  But I do hope that we will talk with each other and not over each other -- (applause) -- because one of the objectives of democracy and debate is, is that we start refining our own views because maybe other people have different perspectives, things we didn't think of.
Where we do disagree, let's disagree over things that are real, not these wild misrepresentations that bear no resemblance to anything that's actually been proposed.  (Applause.)  Because the way politics works sometimes is that people who want to keep things the way they are will try to scare the heck out of folks and they'll create boogeymen out there that just aren't real.  (Applause.)
So this is an important and complicated issue that deserves serious debate.  And we have months to go before we're done, and years after that to phase in all these reforms and get them right.  And I know this:  Despite all the hand-wringing pundits and the best efforts of those who are profiting from the status quo, we are closer to achieving health insurance reform than we have ever been.  We have the American Nurses Association supporting us.  (Applause.)  We have the American Medical Association on board.  (Applause.)
America's doctors and nurses know firsthand how badly we need reform.  We have broad agreement in Congress on about 80 percent of what we're trying to do.  We have an agreement from the drug companies to make prescription drugs more affordable for seniors.  We can cut the doughnut hole in half if we pass reform. (Applause.)  We have the AARP on board because they know this is a good deal for our seniors.  (Applause.)
But let's face it, now is the hard part -- because the history is clear -- every time we come close to passing health insurance reform, the special interests fight back with everything they've got.  They use their influence.  They use their political allies to scare and mislead the American people. They start running ads.  This is what they always do.
We can't let them do it again.  Not this time.  Not now.  (Applause.)  Because for all the scare tactics out there, what is truly scary -- what is truly risky -- is if we do nothing.  If we let this moment pass -- if we keep the system the way it is right now -- we will continue to see 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance every day.  Your premiums will continue to skyrocket.  They have gone up three times faster than your wages and they will keep on going up.
Our deficit will continue to grow because Medicare and Medicaid are on an unsustainable path.  Medicare is slated to go into the red in about eight to 10 years.  I don't know if people are aware of that.  If I was a senior citizen, the thing I'd be worried about right now is Medicare starts running out of money because we haven't done anything to make sure that we're getting a good bang for our buck when it comes to health care.  And insurance companies will continue to profit by discriminating against people for the simple crime of being sick.  Now, that's not a future I want for my children.  It's not a future that I want for the United States of America.
New Hampshire, I was up here campaigning a long time.  (Laughter.)  A lot of you guys came to my town hall events.  Some of you voted for me, some of you didn't.  But here's one thing I've got to say:  I never said this was going to be easy.  I never said change would be easy.  If it were easy, it would have already been done.  Change is hard.  And it doesn't start in Washington.  It begins in places like Portsmouth, with people like Lori, who have the courage to share their stories and fight for something better.  (Applause.)
That's what we need to do right now.  And I need your help.  If you want a health care system that works for the American people -- (applause) -- as well as it works for the insurance companies, I need your help -- knocking on doors, talking to your neighbors.  Spread the facts.  Let's get this done.  (Applause.)
Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  Yes we can!  Yes we can!  Yes we can!
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  I remember that.
Everybody have a seat.  All right, this is the fun part.  (Laughter.)  Now, first of all, by the way, let's thank the band -- I didn't see the band over here.  Thank you, band.  (Applause.)  Great job.
All right, here's how we're going to do this.  We do a lot of town hall meetings in New Hampshire, so everybody knows the basic outlines of this thing.  If you have a question just raise your hand.  There are people with microphones in the audience.  I am going to try to go girl-boy-girl-boy, to make sure it's fair. (Laughter.)  If I hear only from people who agree with me I'm going to actively ask some folks who are concerned about health care, give them a chance to ask their questions, because I think we've got to make sure that we get out -- surface some of the debates and concerns that people have.  Some of them are legitimate.  I'm going to try to get through as many questions as I can.  But if you can keep your question or comment relatively brief, then I will try to keep my answers relatively brief, okay? (Laughter.)
All right, so we're just going to go around the room and I'm going to start with this gentleman right here, this gentleman right here.  Please introduce yourself, if you don't mind.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Welcome to Portsmouth and New Hampshire.  My name is Peter Schmidt.  I'm a state representative from Dover.  I'm a senior citizen.  I have a wonderful government-run health care plan called Medicare.  I like it.  It's affordable, it's reasonable, nobody tells me what I need to do.  I just go to my doctor at the hospital, I get care.
Now, one of the things you've been doing in your campaign to change the situation is you've been striving for bipartisanship. I think it's a wonderful idea, but my question is, if the Republicans actively refuse to participate in a reasonable way with reasonable proposals, isn't it time to just say we're going to pass what the American people need and what they want, without the Republicans?  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me make a couple of points.  First of all, you make a point about Medicare that's very important.  I've been getting a lot of letters, pro and con, for health care reform, and one of the letters I received recently, a woman was very exercised about what she had heard about my plan.  She says, ""I don't want government-run health care.  I don't want you meddling in the private marketplace.  And keep your hands off my Medicare.""  (Laughter.)  True story.
And so I do think it's important for particularly seniors who currently receive Medicare to understand that if we're able to get something right like Medicare, then there should be a little more confidence that maybe the government can have a role -- not the dominant role, but a role -- in making sure the people are treated fairly when it comes to insurance.  (Applause.)
Under our proposal, the majority of Americans will still be getting their health care from private insurers.  All we want to do is just make sure that private insurers are treating you fairly so that you are not buying something where if you failed to read the fine print, next thing you know, when you actually get sick, you have no coverage.
We also want to make sure that everybody has some options. So there's been talk about this public option.  This is where a lot of the idea of government takeover of health care comes from. All we want to do is set up a set of options so that if you don't have health insurance or you're underinsured you can have the same deal that members of Congress have, which is they can look at a menu of options -- we're calling it an exchange, but it's basically just a menu of different health care plans -- and you will be able to select the one that suits your family best.
And I do think that having a public option as part of that would keep the insurance companies honest, because if they've got a public plan out there that they've got to compete against, as long as it's not being subsidized by taxpayers, then that will give you some sense of what -- sort of a good bargain for what basic health care would be.  (Applause.)
Now, I think that there are some of my Republican friends on Capitol Hill who are sincerely trying to figure out if they can find a health care bill that works -- Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Olympia Snowe from Maine have been -- (applause) -- yes, I got to admit I like Olympia, too.  (Laughter.)  They are diligently working to see if they can come up with a plan that could get both Republican and Democratic support.
But I have to tell you, when I listen to folks like Lori and families all across America who are just getting pounded by the current health care system, and when I look at the federal budget and realize that if we don't control costs on health care, there is no way for us to close the budget deficit -- it will just keep on skyrocketing -- when I look at those two things, I say we have to get it done.  And my hope is we can do it in a bipartisan fashion, but the most important thing is getting it done for the American people.  (Applause.)
All right.  Let's -- this young lady right here.  All right, this young lady right here.  She's still enjoying her summer.  When do you go back to school?
Q    I go back to school September 3rd.
THE PRESIDENT:  September 3rd, okay.  What's your name?
Q    Julia Hall from Malden, Massachusetts.
THE PRESIDENT:  Nice to meet you, Julia.  (Applause.)
Q    I saw -- as I was walking in, I saw a lot of signs outside saying mean things about reforming health care.  How do kids know what is true, and why do people want a new system that can -- that help more of us?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the -- I've seen some of those signs. (Laughter.)  Let me just be specific about some things that I've been hearing lately that we just need to dispose of here.  The rumor that's been circulating a lot lately is this idea that somehow the House of Representatives voted for ""death panels"" that will basically pull the plug on grandma because we've decided that we don't -- it's too expensive to let her live anymore.  (Laughter.)  And there are various -- there are some variations on this theme.
It turns out that I guess this arose out of a provision in one of the House bills that allowed Medicare to reimburse people for consultations about end-of-life care, setting up living wills, the availability of hospice, et cetera.  So the intention of the members of Congress was to give people more information so that they could handle issues of end-of-life care when they're ready, on their own terms.  It wasn't forcing anybody to do anything.  This is I guess where the rumor came from.
The irony is that actually one of the chief sponsors of this bill originally was a Republican -- then House member, now senator, named Johnny Isakson from Georgia -- who very sensibly thought this is something that would expand people's options.  And somehow it's gotten spun into this idea of ""death panels.""  I am not in favor of that.  So just I want to -- (applause.)  I want to clear the air here.
Now, in fairness, the underlying argument I think has to be addressed, and that is people's concern that if we are reforming the health care system to make it more efficient, which I think we have to do, the concern is that somehow that will mean rationing of care, right? -- that somehow some government bureaucrat out there will be saying, well, you can't have this test or you can't have this procedure because some bean-counter decides that this is not a good way to use our health care dollars.  And this is a legitimate concern, so I just want to address this.
We do think that systems like Medicare are very inefficient right now, but it has nothing to do at the moment with issues of benefits.  The inefficiencies all come from things like paying $177 billion to insurance companies in subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage that is not competitively bid, so insurance companies basically get a $177 billion of taxpayer money to provide services that Medicare already provides.  And it's no better -- it doesn't result in better health care for seniors.  It is a giveaway of $177 billion.
Now, think about what we could do with $177 billion over 10 years.  I don't think that's a good use of money.  I would rather spend that money on making sure that Lori can have coverage, making sure that people who don't have health insurance get some subsidies, than I would want to be subsidizing insurance companies.  (Applause.)
Another way of putting this is right now insurance companies are rationing care.  They are basically telling you what's covered and what's not.  They're telling you:  We'll cover this drug, but we won't cover that drug; you can have this procedure, or, you can't have that procedure.  So why is it that people would prefer having insurance companies make those decisions, rather than medical experts and doctors figuring out what are good deals for care and providing that information to you as a consumer and your doctor so you can make the decisions?
So I just want to be very clear about this.  I recognize there is an underlying fear here that people somehow won't get the care they need.  You will have not only the care you need, but also the care that right now is being denied to you -- only if we get health care reform.  That's what we're fighting for.  (Applause.)
All right.  Gentleman back here, with the baseball cap.  Right there.
Q    Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Bill Anderson from New Hampshire.  In reference to what you just said -- I'm presently under the New Hampshire Medicaid system and I have to take a drug called Lipitor.  When I got onto this program they said, no, we're not going to cover Lipitor -- even though I'd been on that pill for probably 10 years, based on the information my doctor feels is right for me.  And I had to go through two different trials of other kinds of drugs before it was finally deemed that I was able to go back on the Lipitor through the New Hampshire Medicaid system.  So here it is, the Medicaid that you guys are administering and you're telling me that it's good -- but in essence, I'm dealing with the same thing, and you're telling me the insurance companies are doing.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a legitimate point.  I don't know all the details, but it sounds to me like they were probably trying to have you take a generic as opposed to a brand name.  Is that right?  And it turned out that you did not have as good of a reaction under the generic as the brand name, and then they put you back on the brand name.  Is that what happened?
Q    Correct, to save money.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well -- right.  Look, there may be -- in nine out of 10 cases, the generic might work as well or better than the brand name.  And we don't want to just subsidize the drug companies if you've got one that works just as well as another.
The important thing about the story that you just told me was -- is that once it was determined that, in fact, you needed the brand name, you were able to get the brand name.  Now, I want to be absolutely clear here:  There are going to be instances where if there is really strong scientific evidence that the generic and the brand name work just as well, and the brand name costs twice as much, that the taxpayer should try to get the best deal possible, as long as if it turns out that the generic doesn't work as well, you're able to get the brand name.
So the basic principle that we want to set up here is that  -- if you're in private insurance, first of all, your private insurance can do whatever you want.  If you're under a government program, then it makes sense for us to make sure that we're getting the best deal possible and not just giving drug makers or insurers more money than they should be getting.  But ultimately, you've got to be able to get the best care based on what the doctor says.
And it sounds like that is eventually what happened.  It may be that it wasn't as efficient -- it wasn't as smooth as it should have been, but that result is actually a good one.  And you think about all the situations where a generic actually would have worked -- in fact, one of the things I want to do is to speed up generics getting introduced to the marketplace, because right now drug companies -- (applause) -- right now drug companies are fighting so that they can keep essentially their patents on their brand-name drugs a lot longer.  And if we can make those patents a little bit shorter, generics get on the market sooner, ultimately you as consumers will save money.  All right?  But it was an excellent question, so thank you.
All right, it's a young woman's turn -- or a lady's turn.  Right here.  Yes, you.
Q    Good afternoon, Mr. President.  I'm Jackie Millet (phonetic) and I'm from Wells, Maine, and my question is, I am presently on Medicare and I do have a supplement.  But if something happens to my husband, I lose the supplement.  And what will happen?  I take a lot of medications.  I need a lot -- I've had a lot of procedures.  And how will Medicare under the new proposal help people who are going to need things like this?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, another myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits.  We are not.  AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay?  So I just want seniors to be clear about this, because if you look at the polling, it turns out seniors are the ones who are most worried about health care reform.  And that's understandable, because they use a lot of care, they've got Medicare, and it's already hard for a lot of people even on Medicare because of the supplements and all the other costs out of pocket that they're still paying.
So I just want to assure we're not talking about cutting Medicare benefits.  We are talking about making Medicare more efficient, eliminating the insurance subsidies, working with hospitals so that they are changing some of the reimbursement practices.
Right now hospitals, they are not penalized if there are constant readmission rates from patients that have gone through the hospital.  If you go to a -- if you go to a car company or a auto shop, if you say, ""Can I have my car repaired?"", you get your car repaired -- if two weeks later it's broken down again, if you take it back, hopefully they're not going to charge you again for repairing the car.  You want them to do it right the first time.  And too often we're not seeing the best practices in some of these hospitals to prevent people from being readmitted.   That costs a lot of money.  So those are the kinds of changes we're talking about.
Now, in terms of savings for you as a Medicare recipient, the biggest one is on prescription drugs, because the prescription drug companies have already said that they would be willing to put up $80 billion in rebates for prescription drugs as part of a health care reform package.
Now, we may be able to get even more than that.  But think about it.  When the prescription drug plan was passed, Medicare Part D, they decided they weren't going to negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.  And as a consequence, seniors are way over-paying -- there's that big doughnut hole that forces them to go out of pocket.  You say you take a lot of medications; that means that doughnut hole is always something that's looming out there for you.  If we can cut that doughnut hole in half, that's money directly out of your pocket.  And that's one of the reasons that AARP is so supportive, because they see this as a way of potentially saving seniors a lot of money on prescription drugs.  Okay?
All right.  The gentleman right here in the white shirt.
Q    Good afternoon, Mr. President.  My name is Ben Hershinson (ph).  I'm from Ogunquit, Maine, and also Florida.  And I'm a Republican -- I don't know what I'm doing here, but I'm here.  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  We're happy to have you.  We're happy to have you.  (Applause.)
Q    Mr. President, you've been quoted over the years -- when you were a senator and perhaps even before then -- that you were essentially a supporter of a universal plan.  I'm beginning to see that you're changing that.  Do you honestly believe that? Because that is my concern.  I'm on Medicare, but I still worry that if we go to a public option, period, that the private companies, the insurance companies, rather than competing -- because who can compete with the government; the answer is nobody.  So my question is do you still -- as yourself, now -- support a universal plan?  Or are you open to the private industry still being maintained?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it's an excellent question, so I appreciate the chance to respond.  First of all, I want to make a distinction between a universal plan versus a single-payer plan, because those are two different things.
A single-payer plan would be a plan like Medicare for all, or the kind of plan that they have in Canada, where basically government is the only person -- is the only entity that pays for all health care.  Everybody has a government-paid-for plan, even though in, depending on which country, the doctors are still private or the hospitals might still be private.  In some countries, the doctors work for the government and the hospitals are owned by the government.  But the point is, is that government pays for everything, like Medicare for all.  That is a single-payer plan.
I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive.  So what would end up happening would be, a lot of people who currently have employer-based health care would suddenly find themselves dropped, and they would have to go into an entirely new system that had not been fully set up yet.  And I would be concerned about the potential destructiveness of that kind of transition.
All right?  So I'm not promoting a single-payer plan.
I am promoting a plan that will assure that every single person is able to get health insurance at an affordable price, and that if they have health insurance they are getting a good deal from the insurance companies.  That's what I'm fighting for. (Applause.)
Now, the way we have approached it, is that if you've got health care under a private plan, if your employer provides you health care or you buy your own health care and you're happy with it, you won't have to change.
What we're saying is, if you don't have health care, then you will be able to go to an exchange similar to the menu of options that I used to have as a member of Congress, and I can look and see what are these various private health care plans offering, what's a good deal, and I'll be able to buy insurance from that exchange.  And because it's a big pool, I'll be able to drive down costs, I'll get a better deal than if I was trying to get health insurance on my own.
This is true, by the way, for small businesses, as well.  A lot of small businesses, they end up paying a lot more than large businesses per person for health care, because they've got no bargaining power, they've got no leverage.  So we wanted small businesses to be able to buy into this big pool, okay?
Now, the only thing that I have said is that having a public option in that menu would provide competition for insurance companies to keep them honest.
Now, I recognize, though, you make a legitimate -- you raise a legitimate concern.  People say, well, how can a private company compete against the government?  And my answer is that if the private insurance companies are providing a good bargain, and if the public option has to be self-sustaining -- meaning taxpayers aren't subsidizing it, but it has to run on charging premiums and providing good services and a good network of doctors, just like any other private insurer would do -- then I think private insurers should be able to compete.  They do it all the time.  (Applause.)
I mean, if you think about -- if you think about it, UPS and FedEx are doing just fine, right?  No, they are.  It's the Post Office that's always having problems.  (Laughter.)
So right now you've got private insurers who are out there competing effectively, even though a lot of people get their care through Medicare or Medicaid or VA.  So there's nothing inevitable about this somehow destroying the private marketplace, as long as -- and this is a legitimate point that you're raising -- that it's not set up where the government is basically being subsidized by the taxpayers, so that even if they're not providing a good deal, we keep on having to pony out more and more money.  And I've already said that can't be the way the public option is set up.  It has to be self-sustaining.
Does that answer your question?  Okay, thank you.  (Applause.)
All right, right there.  Go ahead.
Q    Hello, Mr. President.  My name is Linda Becher (ph).  I'm from Portsmouth and I have proudly taught at this high school for 37 years.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, congratulations.
Q    Thank you.  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  What do you teach?
Q    I teach English and Journalism.
THE PRESIDENT:  Excellent.
Q    Yes, thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
Q    And in those 37 years, I've been lucky enough to have very good health care coverage and my concerns currently are for those who do not.  And I guess my question is if every American who needed it has access to good mental health care, what do you think the impact would be on our society?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you raise the -- (applause) -- you know, mental health has always been undervalued in the health insurance market.  And what we now know is, is that somebody who has severe depression has a more debilitating and dangerous illness than somebody who's got a broken leg.  But a broken leg, nobody argues that's covered.  Severe depression, unfortunately, oftentimes isn't even under existing insurance policies.
So I think -- I've been a strong believer in mental health parity, recognizing that those are serious illnesses.  (Applause.)  And I would like to see a mental health component as part of a package that people are covered under, under our plan. Okay?  (Applause.)
All right.  This gentleman right here.
Q    Hello, Mr. President.  I'm Justin Higgins from Stratham, New Hampshire.
THE PRESIDENT:  How are you, Justin?
Q    Fine, thank you.  There's a lot of misinformation about how we're going to pay for this health care plan.  And I'm wondering how we're going to do this without raising the taxes on the middle class, because I don't want the burden to fall on my parents, and also I'm a college student so --
THE PRESIDENT:  They've already got enough problems paying your college tuition.  (Laughter.)
Q    Exactly.  Exactly.
THE PRESIDENT:  I hear you.
Q    Also I'm looking towards my future with career options and opportunities and I don't want inflation to skyrocket by just adding this to the national debt.  So I'm wondering how we can avoid both of those scenarios.  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Right, it's a great question.  First of all, I said I won't sign a bill that adds to the deficit or the national debt.  Okay?  So this will have to be paid for.  That, by the way, is in contrast to the prescription drug bill that was passed that cost hundreds of billions of dollars, by the previous administration and previous Congress, that was not paid for at all, and that was a major contributor to our current national debt.
That's why you will forgive me if sometimes I chuckle a little bit when I hear all these folks saying, ""oh, big-spending Obama"" -- when I'm proposing something that will be paid for and they signed into law something that wasn't, and they had no problem with it.  Same people, same folks.  And they say with a straight face how we've got to be fiscally responsible.  (Applause.)
Now, having said that, paying for it is not simple.  I don't want to pretend that it is.  By definition, if we're helping people who currently don't have health insurance, that's going to cost some money.  It's been estimated to cost somewhere between, let's say, $800 billion and a trillion dollars over 10 years.  Now, it's important that we're talking about over 10 years because sometimes the number ""trillion"" gets thrown out there and everybody think it's a trillion dollars a year -- gosh, that -- how are we going to do that?  So it's about a hundred billion dollars a year to cover everybody and to implement some of the insurance reforms that we're talking about.
About two-thirds of those costs we can cover by eliminating the inefficiencies that I already mentioned.  So I already talked about $177 billion worth of subsidies to the insurance companies. Let's take that money, let's put it in the kitty.  There's about $500 billion to $600 billion over 10 years that can be saved without cutting benefits for people who are currently receiving Medicare, actually making the system more efficient over time.
That does still leave, though, anywhere from $300 billion to $400 billion over 10 years, or $30 billion to $40 billion a year. That does have to be paid for, and we will need new sources of revenue to pay for it.  And I've made a proposal that would -- I want to just be very clear -- the proposal, my preferred approach to this would have been to take people like myself who make more than $250,000 a year, and limit the itemized deductions that we can take to the same level as middle-class folks can take them.  (Applause.)
Right now, the average person -- the average middle-class family, they're in the 28-percent tax bracket, and so they basically can itemize, take a deduction that is about 28 percent. I can take -- since I'm in a much higher tax bracket, I can take a much bigger deduction.  And so as a consequence, if I give a charitable gift, I get a bigger break from Uncle Sam than you do.
So what I've said is let's just even it out.  That would actually raise sufficient money.  Now, that was my preferred way of paying for it.  Members of Congress have had different ideas. And we are still exploring these ideas.
By the time that we actually have a bill that is set, that is reconciled between House and Senate and is voted on, it will be very clear what those ideas are.  My belief is, is that it should not burden people who make $250,000 a year or less.
And I think that's the commitment that I made, the pledge that I made when I was up here running in New Hampshire, folks.
So I don't want anybody saying somehow that I'm pulling the bait- and-switch here.  I said very specifically I thought we should roll back Bush tax cuts and use them to pay for health insurance. That's what I'm intending to do.  All right?  (Applause.)
Okay, I've only got time for a couple more questions.  Somebody here who has a concern about health care that has not been raised, or is skeptical and suspicious and wants to make sure that -- because I don't want people thinking I just have a bunch of plants in here.  All right, so I've got one right here  -- and then I'll ask the guy with two hands up because he must really have a burning question.  (Laughter.)
All right, go ahead.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I've worked in the medical field for about 18 years and seen a lot of changes over those 18 years.  I currently work here at the high school as a paraprofessional.  I have a little, you know, couple questions about the universal insurance program, which, if I understand you correctly, President Obama, you seek to cover 50 million new people over and above the amount of people that are currently getting health care at this moment.
THE PRESIDENT:  It will probably -- I just want to be honest here.  There are about 46 million people who are uninsured.  And under the proposals that we have, even if you have an individual mandate, probably only about 37-38 million, so somewhere in that ballpark.
Q    Okay, I'm off a little bit.  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't over-selling my plan here.
Q    That's okay, Mr. President.  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  She's okay --
Q    He winked at me.  (Laughter.)  My concern is for where are we going to get the doctors and nurses to cover these?  Right now I know that there's a really -- people are not going to school to become teachers to teach the nursing staffs.  Doctors have huge capacities; some of them are leaving private to go to administrative positions because of the caseload that they're being made to hold.  I really do feel that there will be more demand with this universal health care and no added supply.  I also understand that it was to be taken from Medicare, about $500 billion -- correct me if I'm wrong on that.
THE PRESIDENT:  I just said that.
Q    Okay.  Also, you know, I'm very, very concerned about the elderly.  I don't know if this is also correct, but I understand that a federal health board will sit in judgment of medical procedures and protocols to impose guidelines on all providers -- when to withhold certain types of care -- like, what is the point you get to when we say, I'm sorry that this cannot happen.  Thank you very much for letting me ask those questions, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Of course.  Well, first of all, I already mentioned that we would be taking savings out of Medicare that are currently going to insurance subsidies, for example.  So that is absolutely true.
I just want to be clear, again:  Seniors who are listening here, this does not affect your benefits.  This is not money going to you to pay for your benefits; this is money that is subsidizing folks who don't need it.  So that's point number one.
Point number two:  In terms of these expert health panels -- well, this goes to the point about ""death panels"" -- that's what folks are calling them.  The idea is actually pretty straightforward, which is if we've got a panel of experts, health experts, doctors, who can provide guidelines to doctors and patients about what procedures work best in what situations, and find ways to reduce, for example, the number of tests that people take -- these aren't going to be forced on people, but they will help guide how the delivery system works so that you are getting higher-quality care.  And it turns out that oftentimes higher-quality care actually costs less.
So let me just take the example of testing.  Right now, a lot of Medicare patients -- you have something wrong with you, you go to your doctor, doctor checks up on you, maybe he takes -- has a test, he administers a test.  You go back home, you get the results, the doctor calls you and says, okay, now you got to go to this specialist.  Then you have to take another trip to the specialist.  The specialist doesn't have the first test, so he does his own test.  Then maybe you've got to, when you go to the hospital, you've got to take a third test.
Now, each time taxpayers, under Medicare, are paying for that test.  So for a panel of experts to say, why don't we have all the specialists and the doctors communicating after the first test and let's have electronic medical records so that we can forward the results of that first test to the others -- (applause) -- that's a sensible thing to do.  That is a sensible thing to do.
So we want -- if I'm a customer, if I'm a consumer and I know that I'm overpaying $6,000 for anything else, I would immediately want the best deal.  But for some reason, in health care, we continue to put up with getting a bad deal.  We're paying $6,000 more than any other advanced country and we're not healthier for it -- $6,000 per person more, per year.  That doesn't make any sense.  So there's got to be a lot of waste in the system.  And the idea is to have doctors, nurses, medical experts look for it.
Now, the last question that you asked is very important and I don't have a simple solution to this.  If you look at the makeup of the medical profession right now, we have constant nurses shortages and we have severe shortages of primary care physicians.  Primary care physicians, ideally family physicians, they should be the front lines of the medical profession in encouraging prevention and wellness.  (Applause.)  But the problem is, is that primary care physicians, they make a lot less money than specialists --
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  And nurse practitioners.
THE PRESIDENT:  And nurse practitioners, too.  (Applause.)  And nurses, you've got a whole other issue which you already raised, which is the fact that not only are nurses not paid as well as they should, but you also have -- nursing professors are paid even worse than nurses.  So as a consequence, you don't have enough professors to teach nursing, which means that's part of the reason why you've got such a shortage of nurses.
So we are going to be taking steps, as part of reform, to deal with expanding primary care physicians and our nursing corps.  On the doctors' front, one of the things we can do is to reimburse doctors who are providing preventive care and not just the surgeon who provides care after somebody is sick.  (Applause.)  Nothing against surgeons.  I want surgeons -- I don't want to be getting a bunch of letters from surgeons now.  I'm not dissing surgeons here.  (Laughter.)
All I'm saying is let's take the example of something like diabetes, one of --- a disease that's skyrocketing, partly because of obesity, partly because it's not treated as effectively as it could be.  Right now if we paid a family -- if a family care physician works with his or her patient to help them lose weight, modify diet, monitors whether they're taking their medications in a timely fashion, they might get reimbursed a pittance.  But if that same diabetic ends up getting their foot amputated, that's $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 -- immediately the surgeon is reimbursed.  Well, why not make sure that we're also reimbursing the care that prevents the amputation, right?  That will save us money.  (Applause.)
So changing reimbursement rates will help.  The other thing that will really help both nurses and doctors, helping pay for medical education for those who are willing to go into primary care.  And that's something that we already started to do under the Recovery Act, and we want to do more of that under health care reform.  (Applause.)
All right, last question, last question right here.  This is a skeptic, right?
Q    I am a skeptic.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President, for coming to Portsmouth.  My name is Michael Layon (ph).  I'm from Derry, New Hampshire, District 1 in the congressional district.  I'm one of the people that turned myself in on the White House Web page the other day for being a skeptic of this bill.  I'm proud to have done so.
THE PRESIDENT:  Before you ask this question, just because you referred to it, can I just say this is another example of how the media ends up just completing distorting what's taken place. What we've said is that if somebody has -- if you get an e-mail from somebody that says, for example, ""Obamacare is creating a death panel,"" forward us the e-mail and we will answer the question that's raised in the e-mail.  Suddenly, on some of these news outlets, this is being portrayed as ""Obama collecting an enemies list.""  (Laughter.)
Now, come on, guys.  You know, here I am trying to be responsive to questions that are being raised out there --
Q    And appreciate it.  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  And I just want to be clear that all we're trying to do is answer questions.
All right, go ahead.
Q    So my question is for you, and I know in the White House the stand which you're on has often been referred to as the bully pulpit.  Why have you not used the bully pulpit to chastise Congress for having two systems of health care -- one for all of us, and one for them?  (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, first of all, if we don't have health care reform, the gap between what Congress gets and what ordinary Americans get will continue to be as wide as it is right now.  And you are absolutely right -- I don't think Carol or Paul would deny they've got a pretty good deal.  They've got a pretty good deal.  I mean, the fact is, is that they are part -- by the way, I want you to know, though, their deal is no better than the janitor who cleans their offices; because they are part of a federal health care employee plan, it is a huge pool.  So you've got millions of people who are part of the pool, which means they've got enormous leverage with the insurance companies, right?  So they can negotiate the same way that a big Fortune 500 company can negotiate, and that drives down their costs -- they get a better deal.
Now, what happens is, those members of Congress -- and when I was a senator, same situation -- I could, at the beginning of the year, look at a menu of a variety of different health care options, most of them -- these are all private plans or they could be non-for-profit, Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Aetna, or what have you -- they would have these plans that were offered.  And then we would then select what plan worked best for us.
But there were certain requirements -- if you wanted to sell insurance to federal employees there were certain things you had to do.  You had to cover certain illnesses.  You couldn't exclude for preexisting conditions.  I mean, there were a lot of rules that had been negotiated by the federal government for those workers.
Now, guess what.  That's exactly what we want to do with health care reform.  (Applause.)  We want to make sure that you are getting that same kind of option.  That's what the health exchange is all about, is that you -- just like a member of Congress -- can go and choose the plan that's right for you.  You don't have to.  If you've got health care that you like, you don't have to use it.
So for example, for a while, Michelle, my wife, worked at the University of Chicago Hospital.  She really liked her coverage that she was getting through the University of Chicago Hospital, so I did not have to use the federal employee plan.  But I had that option available.
The same is true for you.  Nobody is going to force you to be part of that plan.  But if you look at it and you say, you know what, this is a good deal and I've got more leverage because maybe I'm a small business or maybe I'm self-employed, or maybe I'm like Lori and nobody will take me because of a preexisting condition, and now suddenly got these rules set up -- why wouldn't I want to take advantage of that?
Now, there are legitimate concerns about the cost of the program, so I understand if you just think no matter what, no matter how good the program is, you don't think that we should be paying at all for additional people to be covered, then you're probably going to be against health care reform and I can't persuade you.  There are legitimate concerns about the public option -- the gentleman who raised his hand.  I think it's a good idea, but I understand some people just philosophically think that if you set up a public option, that that will drive public insurance out -- or private insurers out.  I think that's a legitimate concern.  I disagree with it, but that's a legitimate debate to have.
But I want everybody to understand, though, the status quo is not working for you.  (Applause.)  The status quo is not working for you.  And if we can set up a system, which I believe we can, that gives you options, just like members of Congress has options; that gives a little bit of help to people who currently are working hard every day but they don't have health care insurance on the job; and most importantly, if we can make sure that you, all of you who have insurance, which is probably 80 or 90 percent of you, that you are not going to be dropped because of a preexisting condition, or because you lose your job, or because you change your job -- that you're actually going to get what you paid for, that you're not going to find out when you're sick that you got cheated, that you're not going to hit a lifetime cap where you thought you were paying for insurance but after a certain amount suddenly you're paying out of pocket and bankrupting yourself and your family -- if we can set up a system that gives you some security, that's worth a lot.
And this is the best chance we've ever had to do that.  But we're all going to have to come together, we're going to have to make it happen.  I am confident we can do so, but I'm going to need your help, New Hampshire.
Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless you.  (Applause.)

Workers in other fields use degrees and certifications to make the leap to health care.","Health care may be a costly drag on the economy, but it’s still a great place to find a job.
Midcareer managers and other workers have been migrating to health care jobs for years, of course. Now, with the recession, the lure is even stronger. Hospitals, which employ more than four million people, added 135,000 jobs last year and 19,400 more in the first half of 2009, even as millions of American workers wound up unemployed.
“The demand for talented leaders in health care is only going to go up,” predicted Jane Groves, a senior vice president at Integrated Healthcare Strategies, an executive search and consulting firm in Kansas City, Mo. “All that demand can’t and shouldn’t be filled by people already working in health care.”
Frank Pinkowsky worked as a manager at DuPont for 24 years before taking a position as senior vice president for human resources at the Guthrie Clinic in Sayre, Pa. “Don’t underestimate the value of what you learned working for someone else,” he advised.
Colin Ward, a 37-year-old Baltimore hospital executive, also successfully switched careers, leaving ESPN after eight years of producing sports broadcasts. “I felt like I wanted to be contributing in some other way,” he said.
After 11 months of graduate classes in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a year as a paid apprentice at a Baltimore hospital, he had a master’s degree in health science and management.
Mr. Ward stayed at the hospital, Lifebridge Health, for three more years and in 2007 moved to his current post at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Md., as director of corporate strategy. Still a big sports fan, he produces Ravens football games for WBAL radio on weekends.
The Hopkins school, which also offers a three-year master’s of public health degree, is the largest  of dozens of accredited graduate and undergraduate programs in hospital management. Many managers with experience in fields like human resources, finance and marketing find a welcome in health care, with a little studying up. Online courses, books, journals and professional magazines provide material.
The American College of Healthcare Executives, based in Chicago, offers several online pages of career tips, including a two-year-old salary summary at www.ache.org. The Association of University Programs in Health Administration also lists contact information for many schools at www.aupha.org.
“We just recently recruited a vice president for human resources from the supermarket industry,” said Mike A. Helm, a senior executive at Sutter Health, a hospital chain with 45,000 employees in Northern California. Sutter hires 20 to 30 executives a year.
Health care does, of course, have its own jargon and a host of complex challenges. Managers have to know how to deal with doctors, nurses and professional groups, as well as with regulators.
“There are tons and tons of regulations, and the burden is growing,” said Dr. Steven A. Wartman, president of the Association of Academic Health Centers, a nonprofit group whose members are both research and health sciences universities that include hospitals.
The Obama administration’s $19 billion 10-year campaign to promote electronic medical records opens another huge opportunity, said Dr. Blackford Middleton, a technology research expert at Partners Healthcare in Boston. An estimated 40,000 to 160,000 additional health information professionals could be needed, he said.
Dr. Middleton is helping to develop an executive education course at the nonprofit American Medical Informatics Association and a certificate course at the Harvard School of Public Health. online, and the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health sponsors some informatics fellowships.
The industry trade association, known as Himss for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, offers an array of online courses that can help technology workers move into health care. Last month,  Himss established its eLearning Academy, which, it says, “offers round-the-clock, on-demand access,” allowing students to work at their own pace on subjects like clinician-focused use of information technology, I.T. customer service to the health care user, and health care I.T. strategic planning.
James Platts, 30, chose a more formal academic setting for his training in health care management and completed the joint master’s program in business and public health at the University of California, Berkeley. He now works on health-related projects in the San Francisco office of the Boston Consulting Group.
He came to Berkeley in 2006 from the White House, where he was a junior-level staff member at the National Economic Council for two years. A Harvard graduate in economics, he also put in two years at Nasdaq, studying financial and economic data.
“I thought it would be fun and interesting from a health care perspective to live in California for a few years,” Mr. Platts said, referring to California’s large-scale health care issues and solutions.
Graduates of the Berkeley program are hired at an “average salary somewhat over $100,000,” said Kristi Raube, director of the joint health management program there. Tuition has tripled since 2007, to $35,893 for California residents and $45,093 for out-of-state students pursuing the joint master’s degree.
“Of course, nobody knows what will happen with health reform,” Dr. Wartman noted. One possibility could be pressure to cut costs by freezing hiring and squeezing out management jobs at hospitals and health insurers.
But, he said, “there is a very strong push to cover more people, with a lot of implications for growth in the health care work force.” Other drivers of growth, Dr. Wartman said, include “the continued march of science and technology, as well as uninvited developments such as new diseases.”

Jacob R. Opfer shadowed a pediatrician in Gillette, Wyo., who sometimes saw 45 patients a day, allowing little more than five minutes a visit. Amanda I. Messinger worked with a family practitioner in Kodiak, Alaska, who eschewed electronic medical records, leaving staff members to decipher histories from illegible script. Jens N. Olsgaard manned a community health center in Butte, Mont., where four of five patients had no insurance, and treatment was often structured around ability to pay.
The students learned not only to deliver babies and suture wounds, but also to order unnecessary tests as protection against lawsuits, to hector specialists into seeing Medicaid patients, to match patients with prescriptions on Wal-Mart’s $4 list. And they saw firsthand what Mr. Olsgaard called “a tidal wave of chronic disease” — diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression — that left many questioning how much any one physician could really accomplish.
“I often wondered what we were actually doing to help people,” Mr. Olsgaard said.
Not surprisingly, many concluded that it was critical to reorient a reimbursement system that had profoundly devalued primary care and prevention.
“You have to reimburse for primary care,” said Ms. Messinger, 24, who grew up in Snohomish, Wash. “You have to reimburse doctors for spending the time to catch things early, to manage chronic things, to be able to offer people treatments they can afford early instead of waiting until there’s a catastrophic surgery. It’s pretty simple.”
For 21 years, the University of Washington School of Medicine has dispatched its rising second-year students across the Northwest to provide primary care in rural or underserved areas. The monthlong program is elective, but a record number of students took part  this year — 117 from a class of 216.
The school has a cooperative agreement to train medical students from Alaska, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, none of which has a medical college of its own. The summer program is one of several vehicles, along with loan forgiveness enticements, designed to lure students back to their home states to practice in areas with a shortage of primary care givers.
This year, the students set out as negotiations were intensifying in Washington over wholesale changes to the health care system they will soon be joining. Whether there will be improvements to the system remains to be seen, but few students returned thinking there was little to fix.
Payment policies that leave primary care providers struggling to cover their costs have pushed family practitioners and internists into early retirement, and discouraged newly minted doctors from replacing them. To make a living, and chip away at immense educational debt, general practitioners often find they must churn patients and work long, unsatisfying hours.
The result is that only a third of today’s graduates of American medical schools train in internal or family medicine, the two largest primary care disciplines, compared with nearly half only 25 years ago, according to the National Resident Matching Program, which matches medical school graduates with residency openings. The figure at the University of Washington, despite a persistent emphasis on primary care, is only slightly higher.
For some students, like Mr. Opfer, 23, their summer experience persuaded them that primary care was not for them. The three pediatricians Mr. Opfer followed, who ran the only children’s clinic in Gillette, filled their 13-hour days with hospital rounds and staccato five-minute appointments, he said. One was about to retire because of burnout.
Mr. Opfer said he thought that the lifestyle would be too harsh to raise a family, and that it would take many years to pay off his anticipated medical school debt of at least $120,000.
“I don’t think you can practice optimal medicine,” Mr. Opfer said. “There is too little incentive after going through all this education and being in school for the majority of your life to want to pursue a career just in primary care.”
Other students, like Kylie G. Boggess, 24, witnessed how integral a federally qualified health center could be to a community like Nampa, Idaho, and became all the more committed. “This just sold it to me,” Ms. Boggess said. “You get to have a very personal relationship with your patients. You get to know them.”
Nonetheless, Ms. Boggess, who is from Twin Falls, Idaho, said she had been struck by how much time was devoted to scavenging resources for patients who had little money.
“I would really like to practice in a world where I can just take care of my patients and that’s the end of it,” she said, “where the big elephant in the room is not whether or not my recommendations mean anything because of cost.”
Mr. Olsgaard, 28, also found that money drove medical decisions at the community health center where he worked. “You know the patient, you know the patient’s financial information, and then you make clinical decisions based on that,” he said.
Ben J. Ruffatto, 26, said that after working with a family practitioner in Dillon, Mont., he had become convinced that rationing health care was “a socioeconomic national cultural inevitability.”
“It is right now,” Mr. Ruffatto  said. “There simply isn’t enough money in the system for everyone to get absolutely everything that they want.”
There were differing opinions among the students about critical components of the plans being discussed by President Obama and Congress, like whether health coverage should be mandated and whether the government should create a public insurance option. But even those favoring the Democratic approach said they felt momentum had stalled.
“I really like Obama, but I’m a little bummed,” Ms. Boggess said. “He has yet to really strongly make the moral argument for providing health care to our citizens.”
Some, like Elizabeth M. Stuhlmiller, 25, who worked in a clinic in Tonasket, Wash., said they had not paid much attention to the debate, but had learned this summer to take satisfaction in improving the country’s health one patient at a time.
“I think I can fill a hole; I think that there’s a big need,” said Ms. Stuhlmiller, who plans to pursue primary care. “I don’t necessarily have the goals of changing a system. To feel at the end of the day that I’ve treated a patient and helped them, that would be enough for me.”

Jacob R. Opfer shadowed a pediatrician in Gillette, Wyo., who sometimes saw 45 patients a day, allowing little more than five minutes a visit. Amanda I. Messinger worked with a family practitioner in Kodiak, Alaska, who eschewed electronic medical records, leaving staff members to decipher histories from illegible script. Jens N. Olsgaard manned a community health center in Butte, Mont., where four of five patients had no insurance, and treatment was often structured around ability to pay.
The students learned not only to deliver babies and suture wounds, but also to order unnecessary tests as protection against lawsuits, to hector specialists into seeing Medicaid patients, to match patients with prescriptions on Wal-Mart’s $4 list. And they saw firsthand what Mr. Olsgaard called “a tidal wave of chronic disease” — diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression — that left many questioning how much any one physician could really accomplish.
“I often wondered what we were actually doing to help people,” Mr. Olsgaard said.
Not surprisingly, many concluded that it was critical to reorient a reimbursement system that had profoundly devalued primary care and prevention.
“You have to reimburse for primary care,” said Ms. Messinger, 24, who grew up in Snohomish, Wash. “You have to reimburse doctors for spending the time to catch things early, to manage chronic things, to be able to offer people treatments they can afford early instead of waiting until there’s a catastrophic surgery. It’s pretty simple.”
For 21 years, the University of Washington School of Medicine has dispatched its rising second-year students across the Northwest to provide primary care in rural or underserved areas. The monthlong program is elective, but a record number of students took part  this year — 117 from a class of 216.
The school has a cooperative agreement to train medical students from Alaska, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, none of which has a medical college of its own. The summer program is one of several vehicles, along with loan forgiveness enticements, designed to lure students back to their home states to practice in areas with a shortage of primary care givers.
This year, the students set out as negotiations were intensifying in Washington over wholesale changes to the health care system they will soon be joining. Whether there will be improvements to the system remains to be seen, but few students returned thinking there was little to fix.
Payment policies that leave primary care providers struggling to cover their costs have pushed family practitioners and internists into early retirement, and discouraged newly minted doctors from replacing them. To make a living, and chip away at immense educational debt, general practitioners often find they must churn patients and work long, unsatisfying hours.
The result is that only a third of today’s graduates of American medical schools train in internal or family medicine, the two largest primary care disciplines, compared with nearly half only 25 years ago, according to the National Resident Matching Program, which matches medical school graduates with residency openings. The figure at the University of Washington, despite a persistent emphasis on primary care, is only slightly higher.
For some students, like Mr. Opfer, 23, their summer experience persuaded them that primary care was not for them. The three pediatricians Mr. Opfer followed, who ran the only children’s clinic in Gillette, filled their 13-hour days with hospital rounds and staccato five-minute appointments, he said. One was about to retire because of burnout.
Mr. Opfer said he thought that the lifestyle would be too harsh to raise a family, and that it would take many years to pay off his anticipated medical school debt of at least $120,000.
“I don’t think you can practice optimal medicine,” Mr. Opfer said. “There is too little incentive after going through all this education and being in school for the majority of your life to want to pursue a career just in primary care.”
Other students, like Kylie G. Boggess, 24, witnessed how integral a federally qualified health center could be to a community like Nampa, Idaho, and became all the more committed. “This just sold it to me,” Ms. Boggess said. “You get to have a very personal relationship with your patients. You get to know them.”
Nonetheless, Ms. Boggess, who is from Twin Falls, Idaho, said she had been struck by how much time was devoted to scavenging resources for patients who had little money.
“I would really like to practice in a world where I can just take care of my patients and that’s the end of it,” she said, “where the big elephant in the room is not whether or not my recommendations mean anything because of cost.”
Mr. Olsgaard, 28, also found that money drove medical decisions at the community health center where he worked. “You know the patient, you know the patient’s financial information, and then you make clinical decisions based on that,” he said.
Ben J. Ruffatto, 26, said that after working with a family practitioner in Dillon, Mont., he had become convinced that rationing health care was “a socioeconomic national cultural inevitability.”
“It is right now,” Mr. Ruffatto  said. “There simply isn’t enough money in the system for everyone to get absolutely everything that they want.”
There were differing opinions among the students about critical components of the plans being discussed by President Obama and Congress, like whether health coverage should be mandated and whether the government should create a public insurance option. But even those favoring the Democratic approach said they felt momentum had stalled.
“I really like Obama, but I’m a little bummed,” Ms. Boggess said. “He has yet to really strongly make the moral argument for providing health care to our citizens.”
Some, like Elizabeth M. Stuhlmiller, 25, who worked in a clinic in Tonasket, Wash., said they had not paid much attention to the debate, but had learned this summer to take satisfaction in improving the country’s health one patient at a time.
“I think I can fill a hole; I think that there’s a big need,” said Ms. Stuhlmiller, who plans to pursue primary care. “I don’t necessarily have the goals of changing a system. To feel at the end of the day that I’ve treated a patient and helped them, that would be enough for me.”

And an effort to be announced on Monday by a big New York regional hospital group may be the most ambitious effort of this type yet —  a sizable investment intended as a linchpin in the group’s $400 million commitment to digitize patient records throughout its system, including 13 hospitals.
North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System plans to offer its 7,000 affiliated doctors subsidies of up to $40,000 each over five years to adopt digital patient records. That would be in addition to federal support for computerizing patient records, which can total $44,000 per doctor over five years.
The federal program includes $19 billion in incentive payments to computerize patient records, as a way  to improve care and curb costs. And the government initiative has been getting reinforcement  from hospitals. Many are reaching out to their affiliated physicians — doctors with admitting privileges, though not employed by the hospital — offering technical help and some financial assistance to move from paper to electronic health records.
Efforts by hospital groups to assist affiliated doctors include projects at Memorial Hermann Healthcare System in Houston and Tufts Medical Center in Boston. But the size of the North Shore program appears to be in a class by itself, according to industry analysts and executives.
Big hospitals operators like North Shore, analysts say, want to use electronic health records that share data among doctors’ offices, labs and hospitals to coordinate patient care, reduce unnecessary tests and cut down on medical mistakes.
But hospitals are seeking a competitive edge, too. Digital links, analysts say,  can also tighten the bonds between doctors and the hospital groups that subsidize the computerized records. In most local markets, independent physicians typically have admitting privileges at more than one nearby hospital, and so hospitals compete for doctors as well as  patients.
“The North Shore-L.I.J. program is larger than other programs,” said Wes Rishel, a health technology expert at Gartner. “And it punctuates a trend of hospital groups trying to solidify and tighten relationships with physicians in their communities.”
In other words, the government-backed campaign to hasten the adoption of electronic health records has the potential not only to change how health care is delivered. It could also influence which institutions emerge as leaders in delivering care, as some  local markets consolidate further.
The North Shore program is to carry strong incentives to use the electronic-record technology to try improving the health outcomes for patients —  like managing diabetes, heart disease and other chronic conditions  — to reduce costly hospital admissions.
The subsidy will be 50 percent of the total cost for physicians who simply install electronic health records that can communicate between the doctor’s office, labs and hospitals.
But the subsidy will rise to 85 percent of the total costs of digital records for physicians who agree to share data —  stripped of personal identifiers —  on patient measures that include glucose levels for people with diabetes  and  post-operative procedures and prescriptions for heart patients. That could help North Shore amass an ever-growing database of evidence indicating which treatments and procedures yield the best medical results.
When there are evidence-based standards for the best care for patients with particular conditions, doctors should then adopt them, said Michael  Dowling, chief executive of North Shore, which operates 13 hospitals, 18 long-term care facilities, and dozens of outpatient centers and hospices on Long Island, Queens and Staten Island.
“We are going to change how we deliver care, and we should be held accountable for outcomes —  not just measured on the number of procedures performed,” Mr. Dowling said.
Indeed, the rationale for investing in digital records is that the technology can be used to help monitor and measure the results of care, providing the evidence needed to shift remuneration away from the current fee-for-service system, which encourages more tests, more procedures and more pills prescribed.
The North Shore initiative will begin with about 100 physicians, and then roll out more broadly. Dr. Randolph DiLorenzo, a family doctor in a three-physician practice in Syosset, N.Y., has signed up to join  the first wave. Like many doctors in small offices, he resisted embracing electronic health records until now, citing the cost and complexity.
But Dr. DiLorenzo, pointing to the North Shore and government incentives, as well as a long-term shift to evidence-based medicine and payment, said, “This is inevitable, and now is the time.”
Dr. DiLorenzo was also impressed by the technology, when representatives from North Shore and vendors working on the project gave him a demonstration in his office. The program will deploy tablet personal computers by Dell, and software by Allscripts, which can be retrieved by a doctor from devices including PCs, BlackBerrys and iPhones.
The North Shore move will be closely watched. “This is big enough and bold enough that hospital groups across the country will take notice and rethink their own plans,” said Glen E. Tullman, chief executive of Allscripts.
Still, to move so forcefully, analysts note, also carries risk for North Shore, if the expected payoff for physicians and the hospital group proves elusive. Mr. Dowling acknowledged that risk, but he added:  “This was not done on  a pure dollars-and-cents, return-on-investment perspective. But better health care and better quality should be a good investment.”

Yet the vast majority of health care decisions — 80 percent or more, experts say — are really made by individuals, instead of medical professionals, whether choices are about diet and exercise or  ways of managing chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
The long-term answer to improving the health of the nation’s population and curbing costs, experts agree, is to help people make smarter decisions day in and day out  about their own health. And the most powerful potential tool in the march toward intelligent consumerism in health care may be the Web.
That is why on Tuesday, a start-up company led by Adam Bosworth, former head of the Google Health team, plans to become the newest entrant to the online consumer health business.
Already, surveys show that a majority of adults in America routinely scour the Internet for health information. Doctors joke that the standard second opinion of diagnosis and treatment has become a patient’s Google search, with the results printed out and brought to the doctor’s office.
But the Web is still mainly a vast trove of generalized health information. The ideal, health experts say, would be to combine personal data with health information to deliver tailored health plans for individuals. That is what Mr. Bosworth and his San Francisco-based company, Keas (pronounced KEE-ahs) Inc., mean to do.
Using the Keas system, for example, a person with Type 2 diabetes might receive reminders, advice on diet and exercise, questions and prompts presented on the Web site or delivered by e-mail or text messages — all personalized for the person’s age, gender, weight and other health conditions.
Although success is far from certain, Keas has some big partners, including  Google Health and Microsoft HealthVault.
Health technology experts say Keas is at the forefront of the effort to combine advanced Web and database technologies so it can personalize health education. The promise, they say, is a big step forward for online health tools, and could help accelerate their adoption —  much as the spreadsheet program helped kick-start the personal computer industry back in the early 1980s.
“This is the next generation of applications for online health care,” said Dr. David C. Kibbe, a health technology expert and senior adviser to the American Academy of Family Physicians, who is also a member of the Keas advisory board.
The Obama administration has drafted its guidelines for producing electronic health records — patient records held by doctors and hospitals — with applications like Keas in mind. To qualify for government subsidies, the electronic records must be able to generate patient education materials that help guide care, and eventually share information with personally controlled health records of the sort offered by Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault.
“The goal is not just health care information, but knowledge about what that means and what action to take,” said Dr. John D. Halamka, chief information officer at the Harvard Medical School, and a member of a federal advisory group on electronic health records. “And that is what Keas, and others in different ways, are really starting to think through.”
Other initial partners of Keas are impressed with its technology. Healthwise, a nonprofit supplier of online health information, has created 15 care plans for Keas so far, including ones on high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, weight management and stress management.
Healthwise provides health content to major managed care companies, insurers and Web portals, including Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, WebMD, Revolution Health, Yahoo, MSN and AOL.
But Keas, said Jim Giuffre, president of Healthwise, has a feature  that is distinct from other health services online. “They have developed the technology to make decisions from personalized data,” Mr. Giuffre said. “We think it’s going to help consumers make better health care choices.”
Dr. Alan R. Greene, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, has two children’s care plans on Keas, for ear infections and asthma, and is working on others. Dr. Greene has done projects with WebMD and Yahoo in the past. “But this little start-up has an extremely powerful tool, both personalized and interactive,” he said.
For medical experts, Keas is currently helping them with technical assistance. But the company intends to keep simplifying the tools so that individual physicians or health experts can build their own care plans.
The technical game plan at Keas bears the imprint of Mr. Bosworth’s career. As a senior engineer at Microsoft in the 1990s, he led the design team that created Access, a personal computer database program, introduced in 1992, which enabled nonprogrammers to build databases. Later, Mr. Bosworth focused on Internet software, working on Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser and then XML, an open technology for tagging text documents on the Web and data sharing between programs.
Database expertise, easy-to-use tools for nonexperts and automated data sharing among Web documents are all essential ingredients in the personalized care plans.
At Google, which he joined in 2004, Mr. Bosworth worked on Gmail, Blogger, online spreadsheets and other products. But the company’s leaders knew he was interested in using Internet technology to improve health care. Having studied history  at Harvard, Mr. Bosworth is a voracious and eclectic reader and a globe-trotting traveler.  (The name “kea” refers to a species of alpine parrot, which he spotted on the South Island of New Zealand).
“I spent 25 years of my life building Lego blocks for computing,” said  Mr. Bosworth, 54, adding that the time had come to pursue wider horizons.
His years at Google, Mr. Bosworth said, were good ones, and the work the health team was doing with personal health records was important. Moving  people’s data online, where individuals can control it, he said, would be vital to using Internet technology to improve health care — and only big companies like Google and Microsoft can do that.
“But I decided my focus should be on the other side of the equation — what to do with the data,” he said.
So Mr. Bosworth left Google, founded Keas and started hiring people in March 2008. The company  has 24 employees, and last December it received venture capital backing from Atlas Ventures and Ignition Partners.
The Keas site requires a user to sign in and fill out a questionnaire. Personal health records from Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault  can be automatically fed into the Keas care plans.
Another early partner is Quest Diagnostics, the nation’s largest clinical laboratory company, and, with permission, an individual’s lab data can influence the Keas plans. Users can put in as much or as little personal information as they want. Because Keas works with care providers, like doctors, it is required by law to adhere to all federal rules under the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA,  for encrypting and handling information to safeguard the  privacy of personal information, Mr. Bosworth said.
The care plans present personalized status reports, as individualized dashboards, showing a person to be in the red, yellow or green bands. Green is good, and care plans make recommendations on how to get there.
Initially, the care plans will be free, but eventually Keas will include subscriptions for plans, probably at a few dollars a month. Keas will take a slice, and pass the rest on to the plan creator — the model used by the Apple’s iPhone applications store.
“We’re still learning, so we’re in no rush to charge,” Mr. Bosworth said. “But the idea is that people will get paid for doing things that are really engaging and useful.”
In the long term, Mr. Bosworth hopes Keas will evolve into a marketplace, where health experts are the sellers, and consumers who want the best  personalized advice are the buyers. “I think that’s a pretty big idea,” he said. “If it works, it helps drive consumerism into health care.”

You can watch it online: http://bit.ly/fqNLc
Working for this show is always a treat; very few network news shows dedicate 8 or 9 minutes to dive into a single story.
Even so, I get to interview fascinating people, but have time to use only a fraction of what they say. So I like to use this space to offer more complete excerpts from those chats. Today, an interview with Dr. David Blumenthal, the President's medical-records czar.
DAVID POGUE: Before you took this job, you did a study of hospitals and doctors going digital, right?
DAVID BLUMENTHAL: Yes. We found that about 17 percent of physicians in 2008 had adopted an electronic health record, and about ten percent of hospitals.
DP: And the rest are doing what?
DB: The rest is paper. It's basically the same system that physicians have used since Hippocrates, which is writing on some piece of paper.
DP: What's the downside of paper?
DB: It doesn't capitalize on the tremendous power of computers, which have transformed the use of information in every other part of our lives, business and travel and leisure.
Computers can help doctors be better doctors. They can help hospitals be better hospitals. They can help patients take control of their illnesses, not only by making the information available in a reliable way, but by adding tips and reminders and personalized messages about what to do to improve your health, or what tests to order if you're a physician, and what drugs to use or to avoid.
I was a primary-care physician for over 30 years. I can vividly recall a time when I was getting ready to discharge a patient from the hospital on a particular medication, and I ordered the medication. We had a system that checked the orders against allergies and contraindications, and the computer told me that the patient was allergic to the medication that I was about to use.
I was extremely grateful for that, because I had missed it. It's very easy for physicians to overlook the thousands of details they have to keep track of. And a computer can make that physician a little more aware of all the patients' needs and information.
DP: Where do we stand relative to other countries?
DB: Most other countries have much more use of electronic health records than we do. For example, the Danes have virtually 100 percent of physicians using electronic health records. In Britain, virtually 100 percent of primary care physicians use them. In Australia, Sweden, Norway, virtually 100 percent. In many, many other Western countries, the electronic record is virtually ubiquitous.
Now, I think that if we are successful with the ambitions that we have for this record, we will leapfrog many of our colleagues abroad. But for the moment, I would have to say that we are well behind our Western colleagues.
DP: How is all of this supposed to bring down medical costs?
DB: Well, let me give you another personal story. I was ordering a CAT scan for a patient. And my computer system was designed so that it would look at what else had been ordered on this patient. And it informed me that a very similar test had been ordered on this patient within the last three months, and that I should check that out. And, sure enough, it had the information I needed. So I avoided giving the patient a dose of radiation that he didn't need. I avoided the expense of that test. And I got the information sooner.
DP: Shouldn't that information have been in the paper chart?
DB: It wouldn't have been in the paper chart in a way that would have reminded me to look for it.
DP: I see. But not all doctors are thrilled by all of this. They're saying, first of all, we're the ones who've gotta pay for it.
DB: Yeah, well, I think that's a fair point. But we have new legislation that was part of the Recovery Act, which President Obama signed in February of 2009, that makes available $45 billion through Medicare and Medicaid to help doctors pay to acquire and use electronic health records. So I don't think that the complaint about not having help to acquire these records is a fair complaint anymore.
The second point I would make is that though it's hard to adopt these records, almost no physicians who have acquired them have ever wanted to give them up.
DP: So part of it might be just fear of the unknown, fear of change?
DB: Well, fear of change is a natural human response. I think it's also the fact that it's not easy to get these set up. There is a cost, and we can't deny that. The question is how to help physicians and hospitals get past that cost. Once they get past it, I think once they get over the hill, the valley on the other side is lovely. But they've gotta get over the hill.
DP: A couple of doctors were pointing out that the government money comes as a reimbursement. They have to buy the systems, install them, and then show the government, ""Look, we have it working."" But they're saying, ""I'm a small practice. I'm a rural guy. Where am I supposed to get the money to invest up front?""
DB: Well, some vendors of these systems will loan the money to doctors in advance. General Electric, for example, made that offer.
Secondly, physicians, frankly, make a lot of investments in their practice as small business people, on the prospect that they will get payment for those investments down the line. Physicians buy examining tables, they buy X-ray equipment, they buy treadmill tests, they buy colonoscopic equipment -- and then they wait to get paid. So I think it's a fair analogy to what we're asking the physicians right now.
DP: How does this reimbursement happen? Is it a penalty through Medicare and Medicaid to doctors who don't get with the program? Or a benefit if they do?
DB: It's some of both. From 2011 to 2015, there is a bonus. The Congress has put $45 billion on the table to ease physicians and hospitals into this new world of computerized medicine.
After 2015, if you have not adopted, and you see Medicare or Medicaid patients, you may experience a penalty.
2015 is six years off. Six years is plenty of time for physicians to get themselves organized to put a record in place and avoid those penalties.
DP: And how much does it cost? For, say, one doctor?
DB: On average, the cost is between $40,000 and $50,000, of which about a third is the software and the hardware, about a third is the cost of getting it set up in the office, and about a third is maintaining it. Much of the expense is related to the cost of implementing and the cost of maintaining it over time.
DP: What about the interoperability problem? Every software company selling these systems puts the data in a different format.
DB: We're doing a lot in this office to try to minimize that problem. We're gonna be helping states to create interoperability capability, capabilities to link records, to link institutions.
And we're developing standards at the national level to make it possible for records to talk to each other. And then we're also gonna be certifying records, to give physicians and hospitals some guidance about the capabilities of those records, so that they'll know in advance whether or not the records are gonna be able to talk to each other.
These [standards discussions] are open processes. This will all be a very open and transparent process.
DP: I'm sure you hear this at the cocktail parties all the time: ""What about my privacy?""
DB: Privacy and security are foundational to a modern health information system. You cannot get the computer into this business without assuring people that their information, their personal information, will be safe.
So we are looking at the best possible technical solutions, technical protections, to privacy and security. We want to make sure that we have looked at every opportunity for encryption, every security device that the best minds can think of, to make information safer. We've got it in other parts of the industry, but we don't have it for healthcare. So I think that's a very important agenda item for us.
DP: And what exactly is the privacy fear? People are afraid of hackers? Or people finding out that they have bad breath, or -- ?
DB: There are two kinds of anxieties. One is that their data may be used for purposes that they haven't authorized it. So if they haven't authorized their personal data to be used for research, they don't want it for that purpose. And the way the law gets around that problem is by saying that information should be de-identified; that is, it should be abstracted from the record in a way that can never be traced back to that individual.
And then that information can be used for research on drug safety, or research on the value of particular treatments, or anything els that may be useful to human health.
There's another kind of fear, and that is the fear of the breach or break-in, or hacking. And there have been some examples of that.
That's where better encryption and better barriers to hacking are critical. And, you know, we have a new cybersecurity initiative that President Obama has put in process. It's well known that the security of information is a national need for defense purposes. It's also, I think, a very important need for this domestic policy purpose. So we want to work with that security initiative to know that we've taken advantage of everything that the federal government and the computer industry knows about how to keep records secure.
DP: And the President wants to have all of this in place in five years?
DB: The President has stated a goal that every American will have the benefit of an electronic record by 2014. That's a very ambitious goal. We are working hard to attain it, and we hope we will attain it.
DP: It's a lot of pieces, right? The software part, the money part, the security part, the standards...and all these critics with their objections. Do you ever just get tired of having to explain yourself?
DB: Well, it's a big challenge, it's an exciting challenge, and a historic challenge. There's nothing that's worth doing that's easy to do in life, and this is one of those.
But I really think that history is on the side of this activity. To be a 21st-century physician, to be a 21st-century hospital, we can't record data the same way the Greeks did in 500 B.C. We've gotta move to use the computer to support our work. And that's what we're trying to do.
There'll be bumps on the road. We're not gonna be perfect. We'll make mistakes. But I think the wind is at our back in terms of the historical trends. And we'll get there, sooner or later.

Ms. Gallardo cannot imagine any other system.
“I wouldn’t get coverage on the mainland?” Ms. Gallardo asked. “Even if I worked? Why?”
Since 1974, Hawaii has required all employers to provide relatively generous health care benefits to any employee who works 20 hours a week or more. If health care legislation passes in Congress, the rest of the country may barely catch up.
Lawmakers working on a national health care fix have much to learn from the past 35 years in Hawaii, President Obama’s native state.
Among the most important lessons is that even small steps to change the system can have lasting effects on health. Another is that, once benefits are entrenched, taking them away becomes almost impossible. There have not been any serious efforts in Hawaii to repeal the law, although cheating by employers may be on the rise.
But perhaps the most intriguing lesson from Hawaii has to do with costs. This is a state where regular milk sells for $8 a gallon, gasoline costs $3.60 a gallon and the median price of a home in 2008 was $624,000 — the second-highest in the nation. Despite this, Hawaii’s health insurance premiums are nearly tied with North Dakota for the lowest in the country, and Medicare costs per beneficiary are the nation’s lowest.
Hawaii residents live longer than people in the rest of the country, recent surveys have shown, and the state’s health care system may be one reason. In one example, Hawaii has the nation’s highest incidence of breast cancer but the lowest death rate from the disease.
Why is Hawaiian care so efficient? No one really knows.
In dozens of interviews, doctors and hospital and insurance executives in Hawaii offered many theories, including an active population that is culturally disinclined to hospitals, a significant military presence and a health care market dominated by a few not-for-profit organizations.
But there was another answer: With nearly 90 percent of the populace given relatively generous benefits, patients stay healthy and health providers have the money and motivation to innovate.
If true, it’s a crucial lesson. Health care overhaul efforts at the state and national levels have so far been largely confined to providing bare-bones insurance coverage to those in need. But changing the way care is provided has been given short shrift, and medical experts warn that costs could soar if overhaul legislation passes. After expanding coverage in 2006, Massachusetts is only now tackling the cost problem as expenses continue their inexorable rise.
But the Hawaii experience suggests that overhauling health insurance before changing the way care is provided could work, eventually. With more people given access to care, hospital and insurance executives in Hawaii say they have been able to innovate efficiencies. For instance, the state’s top three medical providers are adopting electronic medical records — years ahead of most  mainland counterparts.
The Hawaii Medical Service Association, the state’s largest insurer and a Blue Cross Blue Shield member, recently offered the nation’s only statewide system whereby anyone for a nominal fee can talk by phone or e-mail, day or night, to doctors of their choosing.
Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, which covers about 20 percent of the state’s population, screens 85 percent of its female members ages 42 to 69 for breast cancer, among the highest screening rates in the country.
One result of Hawaii’s employer mandate and the relatively high number of people with health insurance is that hospital emergency rooms in the state are islands of relative calm. In 2007, the state had 264 outpatient visits to emergency rooms per 1,000 people — 34 percent lower than the national average of 401.
Dr. Ray Sebastian splits his time between the emergency room at Kapi’olani Medical Center at Pali Momi and a hospital in Los Angeles. Nearly all of his poorest patients in Hawaii have routine access to family doctors who can provide follow-up care, while fewer than half of those in Los Angeles do, he estimated. So, he said, the emergency room in Hawaii is not clogged with patients suffering minor problems like medication adjustments and cold symptoms, and patient waiting times are a small fraction of those in Los Angeles:
“It’s like greased lightning here,” he said.
Other states tried employer-mandated care only to repeal the efforts after employers threatened to move across state lines. Hawaii’s isolation forestalled such threats, and its paternalistic plantation history made employer-provided care an easy fit.
In interviews, leaders and employers in Hawaii referred with surprising earnestness to an “aloha spirit” and a sense of familial obligation known as ohana to justify providing care to nearly everyone.
Hospital executives said they never overbuilt their facilities because the Pacific Ocean meant they could not delude themselves into thinking, as their mainland counterparts sometimes do, that they would be able to attract patients from afar.
Since supply tends to drive demand in health care, this may be one reason Hawaii residents use fewer health care services — they get a third fewer magnetic resonance imaging tests and are admitted to the hospital 26 percent less than the United States average.
There are clear problems with Hawaii’s system. Hospitals on the outer islands are small and losing money. With unemployment rising, so, too, are the ranks of the uninsured — which is now 10.7 percent of nonelderly adults. Only Massachusetts has a lower share of uninsured adults, and the national share is 20.4 percent. And there is growing evidence that as the economy has slowed and premiums have risen, employers have hired more part-time workers who are ineligible for benefits.
Barbara Zacchini, owner of Pizzeria Zacchini on the island of Hawaii, said she makes sure that her 17 part-timers work less than 20 hours a week so she does not have to pay for their care.
“I’m for universal health care,” Ms. Zacchini said, “but it’s tough to run a business in this state and in this economy.”
Some employers are ducking the law altogether. A 61-year-old travel agent in Honolulu said her boss refused to provide health insurance although he is required by law to do so. She cannot find another job, so she asked that her name not be used.
She has not been to a primary-care doctor or a gynecologist in years and goes to the emergency room when she needs care. “I could have an alien called cancer growing inside me, but who knows?” she said. “It worries me.”
Hawaii law requires employers to offer standardized health plans with low co-pays, no deductibles and few out-of-pocket costs. Cliff Cisco, a senior vice president at the Hawaii Medical Service Association, said that having a standardized and popular benefit has helped keep administrative costs to just 7 percent of revenue, among the lowest in the nation.
Indeed, many in Hawaii are worried that legislation moving through Congress could, if it supersedes Hawaii law, allow employers to reduce the quality of care provided. So legislators in Hawaii have pushed for provisions exempting the state.
Chad Buck, owner of Hawaii Food Service Alliance, a grocery distribution company with 140 employees, said he feared national health care legislation might allow his competitors to provide low-cost, high-deductible plans in place of the generous benefits now required by the state.
“I don’t want to compete against low-quality health care, and I don’t want my employees to have a cheap second,” Mr. Buck said.
Richard Caldarazzo, 25, a manager at Lulu’s Waikiki Surf Club, said he had worked at restaurants in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Chicago and had never gotten health insurance.
After he moved to Hawaii and got a job at Lulu’s, “I was really surprised when they told me I’d get insurance,” Mr. Caldarazzo said. “My parents couldn’t believe it.”

So, what might your movie picks and your medical records have in common?
How about a potentially false sense of control over who can see your user history?
While Netflix and some health care concerns say they have been able to offer study data to researchers stripped of specific personal details like your name, phone number and e-mail address, in some cases researchers may be able to re-identify you by correlating anonymous information with the digital trail that you’ve left on blogs, chat rooms and Twitter.
Of course, you may be fine with that. On the other hand, you may not want complete strangers rummaging around in your history of movie selections or medical needs.
For example, contestants in Netflix’s competition to improve its recommendation software received a training data set containing the movie preferences of more than 480,000 customers who had, as they say in the trade, been “de-identified.” But as part of a privacy experiment, a pair of computer scientists at the University of Texas at Austin decided to see if it was possible to re-identify those unnamed movie fans.
By comparing the film preferences of some anonymous Netflix customers with personal profiles on imdb.com, the Internet movie database, the researchers said they easily re-identified some people because they had posted their e-mail addresses or other distinguishing information online.
Vitaly Shmatikov, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of the “de-anonymization” study, says the researchers were able to analyze users’ public postings and connect that to their Netflix preferences — including how a person may have rated films with controversial themes. Those are choices a person may or may not want to make public, Mr. Shmatikov said.
Steve Swasey, a Netflix spokesman, disputed the study’s conclusions, saying the customers were not re-identifiable because Netflix had altered the data set before sending it to contestants.
“There is no way with certainty that anyone could link a Netflix member with the data Netflix has disclosed by linking it with any publicly available data,” he said. “The anonymity of the information is comparable to the strictest federal standards for anonymizing personal health information.”
Nevertheless, the Texas researchers say they were indeed able to positively identify Netflix customers, and some privacy advocates say their study raises questions about whether newly strengthened laws governing the security of electronic health records — which contain information on diagnoses and treatments entered by health care providers — may offer incomplete privacy protection. Leaked movie preferences might embarrass or stereotype you, they said. But information extracted from medical records and then linked back to you, they said, has the potential to cause social, professional and financial harm.
“Movie records can be sensitive in some cases; it could be embarrassing for someone to find out I like romantic comedies,” Mr. Shmatikov, the computer scientist, said in a recent phone interview.  “But definitely for health records, this is a huge issue.”
And you don’t need records containing a person’s name and address to figure out to whom the records belong, he said, “As our research shows, pretty much any information that distinguishes one person from another can be used to re-identify records.”
The idea of an entirely paperless medical system holds the promise of more efficient and cost-effective care. And, with the incentive of stimulus package money, many companies are rushing to sell clinical information systems to streamline services like patient scheduling, sample tracking, and billing at hospitals and clinics.
In some cases, the same companies that sell data management systems to hospitals and physicians also store that information and then repackage it to make money on other services.
The clinical information systems market in the United States has sales of $8 billion to $10 billion annually, and about 5 percent of that comes from data and analysis, according to estimates by George Hill, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank.
But by 2020, when a vast majority of American health providers are expected to have electronic health systems, the data mining component alone could generate sales of up to $5 billion, Mr. Hill said. Demand for the data is likely to be robust. Policy makers and hospitals will want to dig into it to analyze physician practices and glean information about patient health trends.
Big players like the Cerner Corporation, which maintains electronic health systems for 8,000 clients, including large hospitals and retail clinics, and smaller players like Practice Fusion, which offers its Web-based health record systems free to health care providers, say they make use of patient data collected from their clients.
A spokeswoman for Cerner, whose Web site promotes its “data mining of our vast warehouse of electronic health records,” said the company shares de-identified patient data with researchers or drug companies looking for patients to participate in clinical trials. The patient records are “double scrubbed,” she said, explaining that the company removes personal data like names and addresses before it runs a search using a numbered code for each patient.
Other sensitive information, like mental health records, might be removed before the patient data is sent out, she said.
The Web site of Practice Fusion, meanwhile, quotes Ryan Howard, the chief executive, as saying that the company subsidizes its free record-keeping systems by selling de-identified data to insurance groups, clinical researchers and pharmaceutical companies. In an interview, however, Mr. Howard said Practice Fusion had not yet started selling patient information but that it intended to do so.
NEW regulations require notifying patients if their personally identifiable medical information gets loose, and they prohibit selling protected health records. But privacy advocates said electronic health records remain vulnerable because no federal law now forbids the sale of de-identified health care data.
In 1997, for example, a researcher identified the medical records of William Weld, then the governor of Massachusetts, by correlating birthdays, ZIP codes and gender in voter registration rolls and information published by the state’s government insurance commission.
There are no current federal laws against re-identification, said Dr. Deborah Peel, a psychiatrist who is a director of Patient Privacy Rights, a nonprofit watchdog group in Austin, Tex.
“Once personal health data gets out there, it’s like the Paris Hilton sex tape,” Dr. Peel said. “It is going to be out there forever.”

Right?
No, says Ab Klink, the Dutch health minister.
Mr. Klink was in Washington last week to attend an annual meeting sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund, a private health care research foundation, and swap ideas with counterparts from other countries. At the meeting, the foundation released the results of a survey of doctors from 11 countries that reflected poorly on the United States.
For instance, just 29 percent of primary care doctors in the United States reported making arrangements for patients to see a doctor or nurse after hours, compared with 97 percent in the Netherlands and 89 percent in Britain. And doctors in the United States were many times as likely than doctors elsewhere to report that restrictions in insurance coverage caused major problems with the time that they or their staff were able to spend providing needed medication or treatment.
Between meetings, Mr. Klink sat down with The New York Times. The Dutch are in the midst of a significant health overhaul to inject greater competition into the nation’s insurance and hospital markets, but Mr. Klink also offered some pointed observations of the health system in the United States.
His first official visit to the United States as health minister came in 2007, and he came with the usual European preconceptions that this country had a wide open and fiercely competitive health insurance market with a myriad choices.
“And what struck me,” he said, “is actually the lack of competition you have.”
Mr. Klink pointed out that nearly 40 percent of the nation’s population gets care from Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Affairs, all of which have significant restrictions on the choices available to patients. “We don’t have these kind of public insurance groups in our country,” he said.
And even among those in the United States who get insurance from their work, he went on, “it’s the employer who is making the choices of the health plans from which you can choose.”
In the Netherlands, everyone chooses from a list of 10 or so insurers who offer a standardized health plan that can be enriched with other options. Those who cannot afford the premiums are given subsidies; premiums are based on the benefits offered, not on a person’s age, health status or sex.
The government once set prices for nearly all medical services, but to inject some competition into the system, the government last year allowed prices to vary for about one-third of medical services. Next year that share will increase to half.
Here is an edited transcript of the conversation:
Q. HAVE PRICES SOARED?
A. All the prices that we have liberated have on average gone down or stayed the same. This was quite a success. We are just beginning to have this competition, and the health insurance companies are only beginning to bargain prices.
Q. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF SERVICES WHOSE PRICES YOU LIBERATED?
A. Knee and hip replacement operations, diabetes care and cardiovascular management, eye operations, etc.
Q. AND HOW DO YOU ENSURE HIGH QUALITY?
A. For about 80 percent of health care provisions, we are creating quality indicators. It’s a problem we want to finish by 2011. Many, many people are interested in quality indicators for hospitals. We all have family and friends, and people call us when they have to go to the hospital and ask us, “Which one is the best one?” And I think it’s quite important to have this double movement of liberalizing prices and having complete transparency on quality.
Q. AND ARE YOUR QUALITY INDICATORS BASED ON MEDICAL PROCESSES OR ON PATIENTS’ OUTCOMES?
A. A combination. For instance, one indicator for diabetes care might be the level of glucose in patients, and the level of referrals to hospitals and the complications from patients — such as infections or how many people had to come back to the hospital within 30 days.
Q. DOCTORS HERE COMPLAIN THAT SUCH COMPARISONS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SICKNESS OF PATIENTS.
A. Yes, we are controlling for that.
Q. YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS FOR PATIENTS. HOW ARE THOSE PLAYING A ROLE IN YOUR REFORMS?
A. We are trying to make sure that no one receives health care that is not coordinated. And that the general practitioners cannot negotiate any longer with insurance companies unless they are part of a coherent group that is offering coherent care. That is a change that we will implement in the coming years, and electronic medical records are critical for this.
Q. THERE SEEMS LITTLE DOUBT THAT POOR PEOPLE GET BETTER CARE IN THE NETHERLANDS THAN HERE. BUT DO THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND RICH IN THE UNITED STATES GET BETTER CARE?
A. The Dutch health care system offers top quality. We have some famous institutions in our country. So I do think we have a high standard of quality, and it’s open for everyone. And if there is a fear that the rationing of care would lower quality, what I have tried to indicate is that we are not rationing anymore. It’s all negotiable. And I’m quite sure that if someone could offer a high standard of quality which is even better than we have at this moment, the insurance companies would, if needed, pay more.
Q. YOU ARE VISITING THE MAYO CLINIC, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A MODEL THE WORLD OVER. WOULD WE LOSE OUR EDGE IN TOP-FLIGHT MEDICINE IF WE ADOPTED A SYSTEM LIKE YOURS?
A. I cannot tell you that Dutch hospitals are better than the Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins. Probably it’s the other way around. That’s why we’re visiting them. But it’s not because this kind of quality would not be allowed in our system. We would love the Mayo to open a hospital in the Netherlands.
Q. BUT IS THERE SOME QUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF SUCH TOP-FLIGHT HOSPITALS?
A. If you look at Kaiser Permanente or the Mayo Clinic, it’s important to note that they were both started by people who really cared about patients and instilled a culture to offer the best health care possible, and they were able to keep this culture for many decades. And as far as I’m informed, prices in these institutions are not that different than those in other institutions or those in Holland. So I don’t think the fundamental aspect of these institutions has to do with the liberal climate in your country.
Q. HOW CAN YOU ENCOURAGE THE CREATION OF SUCH PLACES?
A. What I do not want is the rationing of care and what we call budgeting. So that hospitals get a certain amount of money, and there is no incentive for them to innovate. Because the aging of our society is a major threat for health systems in the future. Many people will want and receive health care, but if there is a shortage of labor, and demand will rise, so prices will go up enormously.
That’s the main reason we tried to change the system and why innovation is so important. Without it, there won’t be enough doctors or nurses, because competing parts of the economy will pay more.

Gregarious, unassuming and a dedicated fitness buff with a weakness for ice cream, she managed to sail through the weekly exams that most of us struggled with during the first two years. Later on, in the third year on the hospital wards, she quickly became what every one of us so wanted to be: the indispensable medical student.
When it came time to choose specialties in our last year of medical school, most of us thought Kerry would do what every high achiever and even the not-so-high achievers were already doing: line herself up for a coveted spot in one of the prestigious subspecialties, a field like dermatology, orthopedics, plastic surgery or radiology.
But Kerry wanted to become a primary care physician.
Some of my classmates were incredulous. In their minds, primary care was a backup, something to do if one failed to get into subspecialty training. “Kerry is too smart for primary care,” a friend said to me one evening. “She’ll spend her days seeing the same boring chronic problems, doing all that boring paperwork and just coordinating care with other doctors when she could be out there herself actually doing something.”
Unfortunately those comments would not be the last ones I would hear disparaging primary care. Even today, similar beliefs persist among medical students and trainees, though they have long since been condensed, reduced to an oft repeated acronym among those choosing specialties: I’m heading for the ROAD (radiology, ophthalmology, anesthesiology and dermatology).
That ROAD has had devastating effects on the physician work force in the United States. While 50 years ago half of all physicians were in primary care, almost three-quarters are now specialists. The future implications are even more dismal. According to one study published last year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, as few as 2 percent of medical students are choosing to step away from the ROAD or from other similar “high prestige” and competitive specialties in order to pursue general internal medicine. The statistic has the power to bring even the best efforts at reform and universal coverage to a grinding halt. Even with other health care practitioners like nurses and physician assistants helping to care for as many patients as they can, universal health care will be doomed if there are not enough primary care doctors.
Experts in medical education have pointed to three reasons for this lack of enthusiasm: debt, income and lifestyle. The vast majority of medical students finish their schooling saddled with enormous educational debt — the average amount is in excess of $140,000 — and primary care remains one of the lowest-paid specialties.
In addition, with fewer doctors and more patients, as well as little reimbursement for the specialty’s growing administrative aspects — filling out insurance company and health maintenance organization forms, making telephone calls and writing e-mail messages to coordinate care with other caregivers — primary care physicians end up working longer hours than doctors in other fields just to make ends meet and fulfill patient care responsibilities. Moreover, while pressing and acute care needs arise routinely in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease, there are rarely calls of the same urgency among patients with, for example, a skin lesion.
But even with current legislative efforts to address educational debt, payment discrepancies and lifestyle differences, many medical educators worry that the results will not be enough. Despite the fact that primary care physicians remain this nation’s frontline doctors — diagnosing new illnesses, managing chronic ones, advocating preventive care and protecting wellness — medical students may continue to turn away from the practice of primary care.
Why? It is due to an issue deeper than money and paperwork. While the frisson of continually advancing treatments and approaches to patient care seem to envelope most other specialties, the image of primary care remains one of a vaguely anachronistic practice — a group of doctors who do not stand on the forefront of creative change and who are continually left holding the biggest bag of administrative expectations and clinical care coordination and demands.
That image, however, may be changing. This week in Boston at the annual meeting of the Association of American Medical Colleges, more than 100 members of the Association of Deans and Directors for Primary Care convened to discuss how their specialty might prepare to care for potentially millions of newly insured patients.
High on the group’s agenda was the need for overhauling the practice of primary care. But unlike the image held by naysayers of primary care, the changes proposed and discussed make an innovative vision of primary care practice central to some of the most exciting solutions for the country’s critical health care problems.
“We’ve got this chance now to do something and create a model of practice that will actually work for patients and attract talented students,” said Dr. Bruce E. Gould, head of the Association of Deans and Directors for Primary Care and an associate dean for primary care at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington, Conn. “When I finished training, practice was less complex. But the systems haven’t evolved to keep pace with what we can now do for our patients.
“A lot of primary care doctors feel like they are chasing a bus that they are never going to catch. With lives hanging in the balance, that is not a good place to be.”
Steven A. Wartman, president of the Association of Academic Health Centers and a general internist who participated in the discussion, added: “Changes in the practice environment could become the single most important force on medical education. If you look at history, some of the biggest changes in medicine have been a result of changes in practice.”
One of the practice innovations is the patient-centered medical home. “For a long time, we have had this old-fashioned model of an individual doctor working with an individual patient,” said Dr. Nancy A. Rigotti, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and president of the Society of General Internal Medicine. “But the model that works best for patients and doctors is a collaborative one.”
This teamwork approach could transform the very role of the patient-doctor relationship. Currently, primary care doctors often serve as a patient’s principal guide through the health care system maze. In a patient-centered medical home, the doctor would be one guide among many. A patient could turn to an entire team of physicians, nurses, physician assistants, social workers, pharmacists and other health care professionals; and each of those clinicians would in turn work collaboratively with other team members to address that specific patient’s care, concerns and health issues.
“In a patient-centered medical home, I would not be the sole proprietor,” Dr. Gould said. “Sometimes I would be the leader because of my specific skill set. But if we were dealing with adherence to diabetes care, the team’s social worker might be the leader.”
Other members of the team would also take up responsibilities that have traditionally fallen to primary care physicians but that are more appropriate to their area of expertise. For example, scheduling and follow-up of routine preventive measures like Pap smears, colonoscopy and mammography would be the responsibility of not the doctor but a health care professional with training in electronic medical records and clinical practice support.
“With a team approach,” Dr. Gould added, “each of us is freed up to practice at the top of our scope of training. And that leads to better patient outcomes and more job satisfaction.”
Dr. Rigotti said there were demonstration primary care practice projects across the country. “It’s sort of like the thousand-flowers-blooming kind of thing,” she said. “Money alone won’t make primary care fun and rewarding. We have to enjoy the practice of medicine.”
“And,” she added, “I can’t help but believe that students and trainees will be excited by seeing primary care physicians who are being creative and solving the national problem of high quality and efficient care for patients.”
I called my medical school classmate Kerry and asked her about her career decision 20 years ago. “I do remember that the expectation was that you should go on and become a specialist,” she said. She never wavered from her choice of primary care and went into practice after completing a residency in internal medicine.
“But,” Kerry said, “I kept seeing a lot of working people who wanted to take care of themselves and their health problems but who couldn’t afford it and didn’t have the insurance.” So in May 2000, she left her practice and joined two nurse practitioner colleagues to open up the Good Samaritan Free Clinic in Moline, Ill., a clinic that offers free health care to 1,000 working but uninsured adults and that counts more than 70 health care providers as active volunteers.
As I listened to Kerry talk about the clinic, I remembered what Dr. Rigotti had said earlier: “There are a lot of students who want to change the world. Primary care is advocacy one patient at a time.”

They need to know if reform will help solve the problem. The answer is that no one has an easy fix for rising medical costs. The fundamental fix — reshaping how care is delivered and how doctors are paid in a wasteful, dysfunctional system — is likely to be achieved only through trial and error and incremental gains.
The good news is that the bill just approved by the House and a bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee would implement or test many reforms that should help slow the rise in medical costs over the long term. As a report in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded, “Pretty much every proposed innovation found in the health policy literature these days is encapsulated in these measures.”
Medical spending, which typically rises faster than wages and the overall economy, is propelled by two things: the high prices charged for medical services in this country and the volume of unnecessary care delivered by doctors and hospitals, which often perform a lot more tests and treatments than a patient really needs.

Here are some of the important proposals in the House and Senate bills to try to address those problems, and why it is hard to know how well they will work:
 FORCED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS Both bills would reduce the rate of growth in annual Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other providers by amounts comparable to the productivity savings routinely made in other industries with the help of new technologies and new ways to organize work. This proposal could save Medicare more than $100 billion over the next decade. If private plans demanded similar productivity savings from providers, and refused to let providers shift additional costs to them,  the savings could be much larger.
Critics say Congress will give in to lobbyists and let inefficient providers off the hook. That is far less likely to happen if Congress also adopts strong “pay-go” rules requiring that any increase in payments to providers be offset by new taxes or budget cuts.
CADILLAC COVERAGE The Senate Finance bill would impose an excise tax on health insurance plans that cost more than $8,000 for an individual or $21,000 for a family. It would most likely cause insurers to redesign plans to fall beneath the threshold. Enrollees would have to pay more money for many services out of their own pockets, and that would encourage them to think twice about whether an expensive or redundant test was worth it. Economists project that most employers would shift money from expensive health benefits into wages. The House bill has no similar tax. The final legislation should.
SIMPLIFIED FORMS Any doctor who has wrestled with multiple forms from different insurers, or patients who have tried to understand their own parade of statements,  know that simplification ought to save money. When the health insurance industry was still cooperating in reform efforts, its trade group offered to provide standardized forms for automated processing. It estimated that step would save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. The bills would lock that pledge into law.
ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS The stimulus package provided money to convert the inefficient, paper-driven medical system to electronic records that can be easily viewed and transmitted. This requires upfront investments to help doctors convert. In time it should help restrain costs by eliminating redundant tests, preventing drug interactions, and helping doctors find the best treatments.
REFORM OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM Virtually all experts agree that the fee-for-service system — doctors are rewarded for the quantity of care rather than its quality or effectiveness — is a primary reason that the cost of care is so high. Most agree that the solution is to push doctors to accept fixed payments to care for a particular illness or for a patient’s needs over a year. No one knows how to make that happen quickly.
The bills in both houses would start pilot projects within Medicare. They include such measures as accountable care organizations to take charge of a patient’s needs with an eye on both cost and quality, and chronic disease management to make sure the seriously ill, who are responsible for the bulk of all health care costs, are treated properly. For the most part, these experiments rely on incentive payments to get doctors to try them.
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION Testing innovations do  no good unless the good experiments are identified and expanded and the bad ones are dropped. The Senate bill would create an independent commission to monitor the pilot programs and recommend changes in Medicare’s payment policies to prod providers to adopt reforms that work. The changes would have to be approved or rejected as a whole by Congress, making it hard for narrow- interest lobbies to bend lawmakers to their will.
MANAGED COMPETITION The bills in both chambers would create health insurance exchanges on which small businesses and individuals could choose from an array of private plans and possibly a public option. All the plans would have to provide standard benefit packages that would be easy to compare. To get access to millions of new customers, insurers would have a strong incentive to sell on the exchange. And the head-to-head competition might give them a strong incentive to lower their prices, perhaps by accepting slimmer profit margins or demanding better deals from providers.
A PUBLIC PLAN The final legislation might throw a public plan into the competition, but thanks to the fierce opposition of the insurance industry and Republican critics, it might not save much money. The one in the House bill would have to negotiate rates with providers, rather than using Medicare rates, as many reformers wanted.
COMPARING TREATMENTS The president’s stimulus package is pumping money into research to compare how well various treatments work. Is surgery, radiation or careful monitoring best for prostate cancer? Is the latest and most expensive cholesterol-lowering drug any better than its generic competitors? The pending bills would spend additional money to accelerate this effort.
Critics have charged that this sensible idea would  lead to rationing of care. (That would be true only if you believed that patients should have an unbridled right to treatments proven to be inferior.) As a result, the bills do not require, as they should, that the results of these studies be used to set payment rates in Medicare.
Congress needs to find the courage to allow Medicare to pay preferentially for treatments proven to be superior. Sometimes the best treatment might be the most expensive. But over all, we suspect that spending would come down through elimination of a lot of unnecessary or even dangerous tests and treatments.
NEGOTIATING DRUG PRICES The House bill would authorize the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices in Medicare and Medicaid. Some authoritative analysts doubt that the secretary would get better deals than private insurers already get. We believe negotiation could work. It does in other countries.
MALPRACTICE REFORM Missing from these bills is any serious attempt to rein in malpractice costs. (Trial lawyers, major supporters of the Democratic Party, have seen to that.) Malpractice awards do drive up insurance premiums for doctors in high-risk specialties, and there is some evidence that doctors engage in “defensive medicine” by performing tests and treatments primarily to prove they are not negligent should they get sued.
Patients who are injured because of a doctor’s or a hospital’s negligence must have recourse. We favor reforms that would try to compensate injured people fairly and promptly — perhaps through mediation or expert tribunals — but would not prevent them from filing suit as a last resort or cap the awards they could receive. Even then, the savings might be modest. Doctors mostly perform high-cost tests because they want to help their patients and get paid handsomely for doing so.

Republican critics say, correctly, that the health care bills would saddle the government with large new costs to cover the uninsured by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy insurance. And they say, incorrectly, that the effort should not move ahead until a sure-fire way is found to rein in rising health care costs.
Their arguments overlook the fact that the government is already paying many of these costs, through special payments to hospitals, each time a person without insurance, and with no means to pay, goes to an expensive emergency room for treatment. It also overlooks the fact that both bills are designed to keep deficits from increasing over the next decade or two.
It would be unfair, and unnecessary, to leave tens of millions of people uninsured while we wait to figure out ways to hold down the rise in health care costs.

Under the proposal, doctors and hospitals that keep updated electronic medical records of their patients could receive bonus payments for using the software.
Officials for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stressed in  a conference call that the proposal was preliminary and would not be completed until spring. The proposal was posted to the agency’s Web site.
Using electronic records could reduce costly medical errors and duplicate  testing, according to Obama administration officials.
“Widespread adoption of electronic health records holds great promise for improving health care quality, efficiency, and patient safety,” said David Blumenthal, national coordinator for health information technology.
Under the proposed rule, health care professionals who use electronic records for 80 percent of their medical instructions could receive bonus payments. They also would have to provide patients with printouts of their medical history and use computers to check for potential drug interactions. Hospitals would have to complete 10 percent of their orders electronically.
The agency will take comments on the proposal for 60 days before beginning work on final guidelines. It separately laid out technology standards that medical software should meet.

103,662,2010-01-12T00:00:00Z,article,Denmark Leads the Way in Digital Care,5424adf438f0d8525e453b4b,"glocations:Denmark, subject:Electronic Health Records, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Doctors",Science,0.0,None,"Using medical devices and notebook computers, patients can see doctors without leaving home, and have the information logged into electronic records.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/health/12denmark.html,1287,"Using medical devices and notebook computers, patients can see doctors without leaving home, and have the information logged into electronic records.","COPENHAGEN — Jens Danstrup, a 77-year-old retired architect, used to bike all around town. But years of smoking have weakened his lungs, and these days he finds it difficult to walk down his front steps and hail a taxi for a doctor’s appointment.
Now, however, he can go to the doctor without leaving home, using some simple medical devices and a notebook computer with a Web camera. He takes his own weekly medical readings, which are sent to his doctor via a Bluetooth connection and automatically logged into an electronic record.
“You see how easy it is for me?” Mr. Danstrup said, sitting at his desk while video chatting with his nurse at Frederiksberg University Hospital, a mile away. “Instead of wasting the day at the hospital?”
He clipped an electronic pulse reader to his finger. It logged his reading and sent it to his doctor. Mr. Danstrup can also look up his personal health record online. His prescriptions are paperless — his doctors enters them electronically, and any pharmacy in the country can pull them up. Any time he wants to get in touch with his primary care doctor, he sends an e-mail message.
All of this is possible because Mr. Danstrup lives in Denmark, a country that began embracing electronic health records and other health care information technology a decade ago. Today, virtually all primary care physicians and nearly half of the hospitals use electronic records, and officials are trying to encourage more “telemedicine” projects like the one started at Frederiksberg by Dr. Klaus Phanareth, a physician there.
Several studies, including one to be published later this month by the Commonwealth Fund, conclude that the Danish information system is the most efficient in the world, saving doctors an average of 50 minutes a day in administrative work. And a 2008 report from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society estimated that electronic record keeping saved Denmark’s health system as much as $120 million a year.
Now policy makers in the United States are studying Denmark’s system to see whether its successes can be replicated as part of the overhaul of the health system making its way through Congress. Dr. David Blumenthal,  a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School who was named by President Obama as national coordinator of health information technology, has said the United States is “well behind” Denmark and its Scandinavian neighbors, Sweden and Norway, in the use of electronic health records.
Denmark’s success has much to do with the its small size, its homogeneous population and its regulated health care system — on all counts, very different from the United States. As in much of Europe, health care in Denmark is financed by taxes, and most services are free.
“It was a natural progression for us,” said Otto Larsen, director of the agency that regulates the system. “We believe in taking care of our people, and we had believed this was the right way to go.”
He and others acknowledged that the system is hardly perfect. It faces budget constraints , and the country is still refining common standards for electronic health records.
“We’re trying to streamline now,” Mr. Larsen said. “There are too many systems out there.”
And he is pushing to use still more information technology and to encourage more initiatives like the telemedicine project at Fredriksberg Hospital.
At Thy-Mors Hospital in the rural region of North Jutland, doctors are using I.B.M. software that pulls data from a patient’s electronic health record and superimposes it on a three-dimensional image of a human body, allowing doctors to quickly get an overview of the person’s medical history. The doctor can rotate the image, zoom in and click on ailments to get more information.
The ambulances have access to electronic medical records, so medical technicians can update them for the doctors even as patients are on their way to the emergency room.
Kurt Nielsen, the hospital’s director, says that while the doctors are not particularly adept at information technology, they have gradually embraced it. And it helps that the staff was involved in developing the innovations.
“My staff at the hospital is very, very satisfied,” he said. “We build these systems in an incremental way, and seek their input throughout.”
It remains an open question what lessons from Denmark, a nation of six million people, can be transferred to the United States.
“Denmark is probably the most advanced country in the world that I have seen,” said Denis J. Protti, a professor of health information technology at the University of Victoria in British Columbia and an author of the Commonwealth Fund study. “Of course, it’s the same size as some of your states.”
Culturally, Danes are also different. Mr. Larsen, of Denmark’s health information agency, says his countrymen have few objections to the national patient registry — perhaps because they have different priorities from Americans when it comes to medical privacy.
“As long you are a healthy man, you fear for your privacy,” he said. “It is when you are sick that you wish people knew what your problem was.”
Still, Dr. Protti and other experts say the Danish experience shows that using electronic health records is efficient, cost-effective — and doable, with a little work.
Dr. John D. Halamka, another adviser to the Obama administration on electronic health records, says Denmark offers the United States a peek into the future, with some logistical variations.
Dr. Halamka, the chief information officer at Harvard Medical School, doubts that the United States will ever have a national patient registry, but he thinks that electronic medical records can succeed as long as patients have control over their own records.
Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Boston, where Dr. Halamka is a practicing emergency room physician, was one of the first hospitals in the nation to adopt electronic health records, a decade ago. It remains in a minority — about 10 percent of American hospitals and about 17 percent of American doctors use electronic records, according to studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Two of the nation’s most robust users of electronic health records are the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the Kaiser Permanente health system. Last week, the two jointly announced that with patient authorization, electronic health records can now be shared between the systems.
At Beth Israel, patients can choose to store their electronic health records using several kinds of programs — Google Health, Microsoft Healthvault or the hospital’s own software — and they control access to their records. In the veterans’ system and at Kaiser Permanente, patients have access to their own health records.
Another challenge is the United States’ sheer size, with 50 state governments and a multiplicity of privacy laws.
Dr. Halamka is vice chairman of a federal advisory panel that has established national standards for electronic health records, meant to help states, hospitals, doctors and patients using various types of software to store their records to share information.
“The standards have been set for parties to communicate,” he said. “There’s hope, and we’re on the right trajectory.”
In Denmark, meanwhile, advocates of information technology are eager to share advice — and enthusiasm.
Mr. Nielsen, of Thy-Mors Hospital, said the transition must be gradual.
“It was done throughout some years,” he said. “It is important to know that it did not happen instantly.”
Back at the 150-year-old Frederiksberg University Hospital in Copenhagen, a nurse, Steffen Hogg Christensen, was preparing medical information kits like the one Mr. Danstrup uses.
Health information technology is no easy task, Mr. Christensen said. Training colleagues and elderly patients can be daunting and time-consuming.
“But isn’t it amazing, how innovative we can be?” he said, smiling broadly. “And all in these old walls.”

But patients often know little about the harm that can result when safety rules are violated and ever more powerful and technologically complex machines go awry.
Because New York State is a leader in monitoring radiotherapy and collecting data about errors, The Times decided to examine patterns of accidents there and spent months obtaining and analyzing records. Even though many accident details are confidential under state law, the records described 621 mistakes from 2001 to 2008. While most were minor, causing no immediate injury, they nonetheless illuminate underlying problems. Following are 18 accidents representing a variety of medical mistakes.
October 2008 — Prostate Glands Misidentified
Five prostate cancer patients were treated incorrectly after a faulty ultrasound machine misidentified their prostate glands. One patient was irradiated incorrectly on 32 of 38 treatments; another on 19 of 45 treatments. After the ultrasound was repaired, quality checks were performed by the vendor, and not the consulting physics group that was servicing the facility. The therapist warned the oncologist that the treatment position appeared incorrect, but nothing was done about it.
June 2008 — Therapist Mistakes Treatment on Alternate Days
A 63-year-old woman was to undergo two different treatments on alternate days — one to the upper lung and the other to the mediastinum — an area in the chest. But because of a therapist’s error, her upper lung received one-tenth the prescribed dose and her mediastinum got 10 times the prescribed dose. The patient died of cancer later in the year. The hospital now requires two radiation therapists to attend whenever a complex treatment plan is being delivered. The therapists must also use a checklist to verify the patient’s identity, the type of treatment, the dose and the site to be treated.
December 2007 — Radioactive Seeds Implanted in Wrong Location
A patient’s prostate cancer was underdosed by 50 percent — increasing the odds that cancer would recur — because a doctor implanted radioactive seeds in the wrong location. Consequently, the rectum and urethra received more radiation than intended. The radiation oncologist then failed to promptly interpret a post-implant CT scan, which would have revealed the error sooner.
March 2007 — Radioactive Seeds Measured Incorrectly
A 31-year-old woman with vaginal cancer was overdosed because of confusion over the method of measuring the strength of radioactive seeds. The operator failed to enter the correct information into the treatment planning software, causing an overdose to her rectum and vagina. The patient faced an increased risk of radiation cystitis, rectal proctitis, and the formation of a fistula between the rectum and the vagina. Neither the physicist nor the radiation oncologist had prepared a treatment plan using iridium-192 — an isotope — in six years.
March 2006 — Wrong Patient Receives Treatment
Patient A had just completed treatment for a brain tumor received additional radiation intended for Patient B, who had breast cancer. Patient A did not realize that treatment had been completed when a therapist closed the patient’s electronic chart and pulled up the chart for Patient B. A second therapist arrived, saw the breast cancer treatment had not been administered, and mistakenly administered it to the first patient.
December 2005 — Therapist Overrides a Computer Malfunction
A patient undergoing I.M.R.T. for prostate cancer was irradiated incorrectly after a therapist overrode a computer malfunction. After the guidance system froze, the therapist manually entered co-ordinates but left out a negative sign, shifting the aim in the wrong direction. Hospital policy required that a second therapist review the data before treatment, but that was not done.
November 2005 — Wrong Body Part Is Radiated; Computer Is Overridden
A male patient undergoing treatment for chondrosarcoma was radiated using the wrong body marks. Instead of  the left chest and upper abdomen as prescribed, the patient’s lower abdomen was radiated. The therapist also overrode the computer, which had the correct aiming point, and then failed to record the override on the patient’s chart.
October 2005 — Old Photos Result in Wrong Body Part Being Radiated
Instead of the upper spine as prescribed, the patient’s esophagus was treated. The therapist used a tattoo from a previous round of treatment to guide the radiation. The computerized set-up notes did not mention that the patient had received earlier radiation therapy, and another system downloaded an older photograph of the esophagus rather than current photographs. Afterward, the hospital introduced measures to solve the software problems and to ensure that second treatment areas were doubly marked. The oncologist did not believe that the mistake harmed the patient.
November 2005 — Therapist Errors Result in Radiation Overdose
A female patient with laryngeal cancer received a 47 percent overdose after a therapist left out the wedges, which modify the beam, for eight treatments. A device that measures radiation produced an unexpected reading, but the therapist did not inform the physicist or the physician. The facility also lacked a written policy for verifying data entered manually into the computer system. Although it was treating 20 to 30 patients a  day, a certified medical physicist was present only 20 percent of the time.
September 2005 — Temporary Workers Overdose Patient
A patient with breast cancer received a 50 percent overdose for 10 treatments because a wedge was mistakenly left out. The medical physicist failed to perform the first weekly chart check. The hospital reported that it had a staffing issue at the time of the vent and that temporary workers did not have the same training or competency checks as the permanent staff.
July 2005 — Wrong Patient Is Radiated, Again
A patient received a 22 percent overdose of radiation after he underwent a treatment intended for another patient. Both patients were scheduled to be treated for tumors of the head and neck, and the technologist called up the first patient’s treatment plan on the computer system. But since the first patient was unavailable at the scheduled time, the technologist escorted the second patient into the treatment room. The second patient was then treated using the first patient’s protocol. After the first treatment was completed, the technologist realized that the wrong protocol was on the computer screen and the treatment was aborted. According to the radiation oncologist, the clinical impact was minimal. But this same facility had also treated the wrong patient in November 2004 and January 2005.
July 2005 — Therapist Radiates Wrong Body Part
After two correct treatments, a therapist set up the patient incorrectly, causing radiation to be administered to an unintended part of the body. The treatment computer detected the error and issued a warning, but the therapist overrode that warning. That therapist consequently had his override privilege withdrawn.
August 2005 — Staff Administers Wrong Radiation Dose
A 72-year-old man with cancer of the esophagus was to receive twice-daily treatments, but instead got only one a day for five days. The facility said the physics, dosimetry and therapy staff all failed to catch the error. After learning of the mistake, the patient refused twice-daily treatments and continued with the one-a-day treatments at a revised dose. A state inspection in November 2005 found staffing problems at the time of the mistake.
April 2005 — 27 Days of Radiation Overdoses
A 32-year-old breast cancer patient received 27 days of radiation overdoses — each three times the prescribed amount, because a wedge had been left out. The patient had to undergo multiple surgeries to close a wound caused by the overdose. The physics staff failed to notice the mistake during their weekly checks of treatment records. The therapists failed to notice that during treatment, their computer screen clearly showed the wedge missing.
March 2005 — Computer Error Not Spotted
A male patient in his early 40s received three massive overdoses of radiation to his brain stem because a device that shaped and modulated the beam was mistakenly left open. A computer crash meant that vital treatment instructions were not saved. The physicist did not double-check the treatment plan until after the third treatment. The error was clearly displayed on the treatment screen, but two therapists did not notice it. The patient eventually died from the overdose.
February 2005 — Math Error Results in Higher Dose of Radiation
A patient received three treatments at a dose 83 percent higher than intended because of a calculation error. The therapists questioned the high dose and were still instructed to administer the treatment. The facility failed to follow policy and double-check dosage before the third treatment. A new policy was put in place requiring that physics work be double-checked before the first treatment.
October 2003 — Radiation Dose Not Checked
A 14-year-old girl received 10 treatments to her arm that were double the prescribed dose. The error would have been picked up on the first treatment if the facility had followed policy by verifying the patient’s dose with a radiation measuring device. Also, the physicist did not double-check the doses.

When you see a new doctor or return to one you haven’t seen for a while, you are asked to complete a written medical history that includes every illness or condition you have ever had (along with operations and their dates), every drug and over-the-counter medication and supplement you take, the major illnesses and causes of death of members of your family, and perhaps other medical facts of possible interest to the doctor.
If you are able to recall and record such facts fully and accurately, especially if you are currently ill, injured or in pain, you’re a better patient than I’ll ever be. Yet today some 80 percent of practicing physicians rely entirely on this kind of paper trail — patient records that can be misplaced or lost, or unavailable in an emergency.
But the future holds potential for a major improvement that capitalizes on modern technology. It goes by different names depending on who maintains it —  electronic health record, electronic medical record, personal health record —  and its promise goes way beyond doctors’ having to rely on the incomplete or inaccurate memories of their patients.
President Obama’s economic stimulus included $19.2 billion for health information technology, and a number of hospital systems around the country are taking advantage of this financial incentive and investing their own money to foster the creation and use of electronic records that are expected to improve the quality, efficiency and safety of medical care. (One such effort, at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, was the subject of an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine last month.)
In an editorial in that publication in 2007, Dr. Cara B. Litvin, then a resident physician at New York University Medical Center, wrote that too often “care was suboptimal simply because records were not available.”
Dr. Litvin, now an internist at the Medical University of South Carolina who teaches doctors how to improve care using electronic records, pointed out that the Veterans Health Administration has used its computerized patient record system for the past decade, and its doctors report that it has greatly improved the care of some eight million veterans. Prescriptions, laboratory tests, studies, consults, reports and progress notes from all visits by patients to any Veterans Affairs hospital are stored in each patient’s electronic record.
With privacy constraints in place to prevent unauthorized access to electronic health records — a requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 —  patients could get electronic copies of their own medical records and have them sent directly to a doctor, hospital or other designated recipient.
Currently, however, the various hospital and medical groups that have gone electronic “speak different languages and cannot transmit information between systems,” Dr. Atul Gawande, the Harvard-based surgeon and the author most recently of “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right” (Metropolitan, 2009), said in an interview. “Integrating the systems so that we can send information across the country is the holy grail.”
The Benefits
A digital account of one’s medical records can do far more than relieve doctors’ dependence on unreliable memories. It can also have these benefits:

Avoid duplication of tests, from blood tests to M.R.I.’s. If you’ve already been tested recently by one provider, the results can be accessed electronically by another doctor within the same system. This can sometimes be life-saving in a crisis situation. If a test has a built-in hazard, not having to repeat it enhances patient safety. Or if a test must be repeated, the doctor can see immediately whether an important change has occurred since the last test.

Reduce medical errors. Within a hospital system, having a record of complications that accompany a particular procedure can help the system identify and rectify the problem before more patients suffer needlessly. An electronic system could reduce pharmacy errors that result from misreading a doctor’s prescription and misplaced decimal points and warn of drug allergies and potential drug interactions in individual patients. If a drug is recalled, with an electronic record every patient on the drug can be alerted quickly.

Make surgery safer. Dr. Gawande said he had just finished four operations, each of which had more than two dozen things to do or think about afterward, like lab tests, blood clot checks, antibiotics, bed arrangements, nursing instructions and so forth. When he and his colleagues had to rely on memory, some important steps were usually forgotten. But with an electronic reminder all now get done.

Encourage better self-care. “Well-informed patients are better able to participate in their own care,” Dr. Steven Shea of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons said in an interview. If patients have access to critical parts of their health records, especially their test results, they may be “more likely to engage in healthy behavior and more likely to bring symptoms to the attention of their doctors,” Dr. Shea said, adding,  “In my experience, the better informed patients are, the more efficient and productive the medical visit can be.”

Improve care of chronic illnesses. Fewer than half of patients with chronic ailments regularly take prescribed medications or get the periodic checkups their doctors recommend. An electronic system can alert the physician to noncompliance and when it is time for another office visit. Electronic reminders and prompts can help patients get better preventive care, Dr. Litvin said, like when they should have a colonoscopy, get a flu shot or get certain lab tests. Electronic records may also help to reduce waste in the system by identifying the most effective treatment regimens for common conditions.

Identify the right drug and dose. In the not too distant future, as DNA-based variations in drug responses are identified, electronic records will enable doctors to choose the most effective medication and dose for each patient. For example, in determining a safe and effective dose of the blood thinner Coumadin, months of risky trial and error could be eliminated by tailoring the dose to each patient’s unique genome.
The Concerns
Privacy concerns have been the main deterrent to “wiring” medical records. But Dr. Litvin notes that the information is password-protected, and that insurers and employers would not have access to a patient’s electronic medical record unless the patient authorized it. “The benefits to providing quality medical care way outweigh any privacy issues,” she said.
As with any innovation, there is a learning curve associated with establishing and using electronic records. “There was a lot of pain in adopting an electronic system,” Dr. Gawande said. “But now that it is up and running, none of us would go back, not for a minute. A well-designed system can dramatically improve medicine’s ability to get better results.”

No matter what the outcome, there will be an unacknowledged monster lurking in the room: managed care.
The concept embodies many modes of delivering medicine, ranging from the nightmarish bureaucratic encounter to the highly professional clinic. Some forms of managed care — health maintenance organizations like Kaiser Permanente, for example — have been accepted by broad segments of the population.
But the obvious downside of managed care is that a provider may be stingy with service and access, precisely because “fee for service” treatment is limited. In the 1990s, many patients rebelled, objecting to bureaucratic decision-making and long delays for “optional” services. To this day, managed care is criticized in many circles.
It is still with us, however, and its role is certain to grow. The fundamental appeal is financial. All managed care plans have a built-in incentive to limit costs, because more treatments do not automatically mean more revenue for health providers. Today, many cost-control methods, such as integrated and electronic medical records, are already common in H.M.O.’s. During managed care’s heyday in the early 1990s, inflation in health care costs was much lower than it is now.
We may not like it, but third parties — the government and insurance companies — won’t be able to pay for all the care that people desire. Yet the aging of the population will ensure that medical costs will spiral. Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, has said that the administration’s cost-control proposals do not “reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount.”
We need to think carefully about how to say no without breaking the better side of our health care institutions. For all the complaints, managed care does not seem to hurt actual health care outcomes, whether pertaining to life expectancy or recovery from disease, according to a series of papers by David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, and co-authors.
It’s time to consider which forms of managed care — relabeled, if necessary — are likely to maintain the flow of innovation while keeping costs under control.
For all of managed care’s problems, national bankruptcy would be considerably worse, and that’s where we’re heading if we don’t rein in health costs. We are already experiencing some preliminary symptoms. In addition to the financial burden of Medicare and Medicaid, rising insurance premiums in employer-provided plans are absorbing a large share of what might otherwise be wage increases. That makes us poorer and keeps us from buying safer cars, eating healthier food and investing as productively as we can. Health gains that accompany prosperity are largely invisible, so we tend to neglect them.
Conceived in its broadest form, managed care can be run by the government, as in Britain, or left in the hands of a regulated private sector. Because the United States already has substantial private-sector capacity, and because many Americans are suspicious of government controls, the private route is the most likely option. Individuals would choose among competing providers — and those providers would try to offer the most appealing bundles of services, relative to cost.
The current tax exemption for health insurance benefits could be modified to encourage more cost-effective delivery systems, including forms of managed care that meet quality standards. For the elderly, the current Medicare fee-for-service method could be transformed into voucher programs for managed care treatment. Of course, people could go outside their network for additional services, if they were willing to pay.
It’s not well advertised, but the Obama plan would move in this direction. Many people receiving new health insurance coverage would be enrolled in Medicaid, which already relies on managed care for about half of its patients.
On a national scale, effective managed care will require the right mix of reputation and regulation to enforce provider commitments, and will need some reframing and renaming to make it palatable. It could accurately be called “competitive, choice-based single-payer coverage.” Perhaps there will be a jazzier, less foreboding name.
The notion of using the market to experiment with cost-control methods isn’t likely to be wildly popular. Still, it is better than relying on the federal government. It’s far from obvious that Congress, inflexible and besieged by lobbyists, will make better decisions. Congress also tends to promise cost control up front but to postpone significant action indefinitely. Nor is it clear that electing politicians to choose a plan for people collectively is better than letting each person choose a plan directly.
ON the other hand, for reasons of perceived fairness, some people may be more willing to accept a “no” answer on health care from a government agency than from a private company. If so, we run the risk of limiting our care choices just because we’re more squeamish about one kind of “no” than another.
The real challenge is to change our fundamental attitude toward health care. We live in a world where we can spend virtually everything we have on more and better treatment. The question is not managed care versus the status quo, but which opportunities — and the restrictions that go with them — we are prepared to accept.
When will we acknowledge that our government — or, for that matter, our insurance companies — can’t pay every bill? We’re in denial, and the longer we wait, the more painful the solution will be.

It’s about carrying out the law.,"Ann Arbor, Mich.
HEALTH care reform, the most ambitious domestic policy initiative of our time, is now law. And already there is talk of how to make it even better. Some want to improve the subsidies and financial protections, so that people aren’t as exposed to high medical bills. Others would like to add some sort of public option, whether it’s a new stand-alone government-run plan or expanded access to Medicare.
Those are good ideas. But making the most out of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will also depend on something a little less exciting: putting the existing plan into action. The challenges ahead fall into four categories.
DELIVERING THE DELIVERABLES President Obama promised that some of the benefits of reform would appear in the first year. For starters, within 90 days the Department of Health and Human Services must set up a high-risk pool as a temporary source of insurance for people who have pre-existing conditions.
Some of the new consumer protections will take effect within six months; first, though, federal officials have to translate that law into regulation. The government is also supposed to provide a new, easy way for consumers to compare benefits from insurer to insurer.
EDUCATING THE PUBLIC It’s one thing to create a health insurance program and quite another to get people to sign up for it. Today, many more people are eligible for Medicaid than actually enroll, in no small part because some states — wary of adding too many people to the rolls — make it hard to apply for and stay in the program.
That said, more than 97 percent of people in Massachusetts now have insurance, thanks in part to an aggressive public relations campaign that enlisted the Red Sox to raise awareness about the state’s own health care overhaul. A similar effort to increase public knowledge and to undertake direct outreach to individuals will be necessary. While states and nonprofit organizations will  play vital roles, the federal government should probably take the lead.
HANDLING THE INSURERS Speaking of Massachusetts, that’s the one state with a fully working model of an insurance exchange: a place where individuals and small businesses can buy relatively affordable coverage, with clearly defined benefits and no exclusions or mark-ups based on the health of the people applying. And the model seems to work overall. But replicating that in 49 other states won’t be easy.
It requires appointing people to run the exchanges and figuring out how Americans will use them, but it also means preparing to regulate insurers more closely than anybody regulates them now. The law creates minimum standards for what insurance covers and requires insurers to spend most of their money on actual patient care,  to name only two obvious changes. The states will have primary responsibility for enforcing these standards, but first the federal government will have to write them.
BENDING THE CURVE Dozens of new initiatives are intended to control, or at least reduce, the cost of medical care. But most of them require work to get up and running.
Everyone hopes that wider use of electronic medical records can improve quality while reducing expensive duplication. Again, somebody first has to set up a standard for the records. Studies show we’d save money if we stopped paying for so many treatments that don’t work (or don’t work better than the alternatives). But we can’t start paying for treatments more intelligently without better information about what drugs and procedures do work, not to mention which ones doctors and hospitals already use.
Progress on many of these goals is already under way. (Development of electronic records, for instance, began with the stimulus.) But there are obstacles ahead: some states are eager to do their part; others are busy suing the federal government because they don’t like the law. The Obama administration also needs to find the right people to manage these programs.
Getting reform right may ultimately require making sure one official is responsible for coordinating activity among the different agencies and levels of government. It should probably be someone who reports to the White House but is also accountable to Congress; someone with a head not just for politics but also for the world of insurance, regulation and medicine; someone who can push the many groups and institutions that will need pushing, while also listening to people’s concerns.
Much as the Iraq war wasn’t over when American forces conquered Baghdad, so health care reform didn’t end when President Obama signed the bill. If carrying out the legislation doesn’t get the same sustained attention that passing it did, then this week’s historic victory will lose much of its luster.

The hospital had just put in effect an electronic medical records system, or EMR, and along with the dozens of shiny new computer terminals installed in nursing stations on every ward came the promise of fewer missing charts, streamlined information and efficient work-flow patterns for all. By the time the first computers were finally installed in exam rooms, my colleagues and I were already fluent enough in the system’s software that we were creating and trading order sets, progress note templates and clinical checklists like kids exchanging baseball cards and CDs.
For someone who likes to imagine herself as tech savvy, it was a heady moment.
But that afternoon as I settled in to see my first clinic patient, I realized I had no idea where to sit. The new computer was perched atop a desk in one corner of the room; the patient sat on the exam table on the other side of the room. In order to use the computer, I had to turn my back to the patient as I spoke to him. I tried to compensate by sitting on a rolling stool but soon found myself spending more time spinning and wheeling back and forth between patient and computer than I did sitting still and listening. And when my patient did talk, his story came only in spurts because every time I turned my back to him to type, the room fell silent.
My vision of an interaction marked by the seamless flow of conversation and capture of information vanished. Instead, I was spinning my wheels. Literally.
In the years since that clown car moment, I have developed a more fluid, albeit still not hugely efficient, style of interacting with patients while using EMR (I memorize and jot down quick notes when necessary, then leave the room to type everything into the computer). But I have met other doctors, our family pediatrician for example, who do manage to use the system well and efficiently, turning the omnipresent laptop or desktop into the white noise of an office visit.
Nonetheless, for every one of us who is using, struggling with or considering adopting an electronic records system, one thing has become increasingly clear: just because EMR improves information sharing and retrieval, it doesn’t necessarily follow that our communication with patients and colleagues will also be better.
This month, the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan health policy research organization in Washington, released a study on the effects of EMR on physician communication. The researchers conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and staff from 26 small and medium-sized practices across the country that used the electronic system in their offices for at least two years. Few, if any, of those interviewed would choose to revert to a paper-based records system. But all the physicians expressed concerns that EMR had less than salutary effects on the patient-doctor relationship, including difficulties replicating the narrative aspect of a patient’s illness and the constant interruptions from alerts and instant messaging.
“EMRs are a phenomenal contribution to care,” said Dr. Ann S. O’Malley, lead author of the study and a senior researcher at the center. But there is often so much information available — some of which requires a direct and immediate response from the physician — that “some doctors liken the presence of EMR to having a 2-year-old in the exam room.”
As all parents can attest, while a 2-year-old can create chaos in any situation, a setting that is as delicately balanced as the clinical one runs the risk of falling into complete disarray. Doctors often must consider several issues simultaneously when seeing a single patient  —  all the potential diagnoses and possible treatments, the patient’s history and list of medications, any possible adverse effects or interactions, the limits of that patient’s health care coverage and numerous preventive health issues, to name just a few of those considerations. The addition of an electronic records system can push some doctors into what one EMR expert refers to as “cognitive overload.”
“The whole point of EMR is to simplify the process and to enhance and facilitate communication,” Dr. O’Malley said. “But in order for that to happen, EMR needs to be more user-friendly and more responsive to the clinical needs of patients and clinicians.”
Currently, most systems have been designed not with clinical needs in mind but to meet the demands of the fee-for-service payment system. The software rapidly codifies diagnoses and symptoms, thus facilitating billing. But that shorthand also encourages clinical shortcuts and less face-to-face time with patients. Time-pressed doctors can fall back on the electronic records, which format and abbreviate information in a way that physicians can absorb quickly. And because the data is in the electronic system, it is easy to assume that the information is as reliable as the patients themselves, if not more so.
“There is a kind of reliance on electronic transmission and electronic data which suggests that they stand in a one-to-one relationship with the truth,” said Richard M. Frankel, a professor of medicine and geriatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis who conducted one of the first studies examining the effects of electronic medical records on patient-doctor communication. In the Center for Studying Health System Change study, one physician recalled the words of a colleague: “This is great. I used the EMR before I came here. I was able to sit down with my bagel and coffee and do my rounds before I even got in.” The system  becomes a proxy for the patients themselves.
While EMR can capture certain information like medication lists and test results with mind-boggling accuracy and efficiency, it often fails to relay the nuances of a patient’s illness course. “Physicians think in stories,” said Dr. C. T. Lin, a practicing internist and chief medical information officer for the University of Colorado Hospital in Denver, which has used electronic records since 1994. “How can you possibly point and click your way through a patient’s 10-year history?” To address this problem, Dr. Lin and other experts have been exploring newer technologies like speech recognition that will allow doctors to dictate patient histories, and thus restore a sense of narrative, into the electronic record.
According to the researchers of this most recently published study, many of the potential pitfalls of electronic records can be avoided if doctors and other clinicians are taught how to use the software efficiently and how to communicate effectively with patients when using it. “There is so much money going toward adoption and implementation of EMR,” Dr. O’Malley said, referring to the $19 billion allotted by Congress in last year’s stimulus bill to promote the use of health information technology. “I think it would be wise for us as a society to invest some resources in training physicians to communicate effectively with others in the presence of EMR so that it becomes less of a distraction and more of a tool for communication.”
And that training would include matters as simple as where we place computers in our exam rooms. Just as hospitals and health care providers have learned to place blood pressure cuffs in every exam room well within reach of a patient’s arm, they can learn how to situate, carry, rest or tether their computers in such a way that they facilitate, not block, discussion.
“Many doctors are never taught communication skills in general or, more specifically, that computers are actually a third party in the conversation between themselves and their patients,” Dr. Frankel noted. “We are asking people to take on a new technology that has enormous variations, and we are not providing enough upfront training for them on how to use it appropriately.”
“It’s really important,” Dr. Frankel added, “to value the best selves of the people who are providing medical care.”

More widespread use of electronic medical records, they say, will help keep costs in check by providing doctors with precise information on the price of tests and drugs even as they are deciding what to order.
According to a 1990 study by Indiana University researchers, showing the charges for tests on computers used by medical residents working in an outpatient clinic led to a 14 percent drop in the number of tests ordered, with no adverse effects on patients. Subsequent studies found similar results when the prices of tests and imaging studies were displayed on computers in pediatric emergency rooms and in a pediatric intensive care unit.
The research is not unanimous on this point. A pair of large randomized trials testing the approach in adult hospitalized medical and surgical patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston found no change in the ordering of X-rays when hospital charges were displayed on computers, and only a small reduction — not statistically significant — in blood tests.
Still, even that seemingly small change in doctors’ test-ordering behavior translated into a $1.7 million annual savings in hospital charges for laboratory tests, said the study’s senior author, Dr. David W. Bates, chief of general medicine at Brigham and Women’s. Doctors “really liked seeing the cost information, so we’ve continued to display it” on hospital computers, he said.
He estimated that charges for tests were displayed for doctors and residents at fewer than 1 percent of the nation’s teaching hospitals. Doctors prescribing drugs to patients at his hospital’s clinics, and at others in Boston’s Partners HealthCare System, also receive computerized prompts informing them of less-expensive alternatives, with suggestions tailored to each patient’s insurance coverage.
Dr. Bates said that students should begin learning early in medical school about the financial consequences of their decisions and that such teaching should continue throughout their training. When he supervises trainees in the hospital, he said, “I ask residents how much it costs to be in the I.C.U. for a day, to be in the hospital for a day, to be in a long-term-care setting for a day.
“Most of them have little, if any, sense — and yet we’re making decisions about that all the time, and they have huge implications.”

He and the five other physicians in Shavertown, Pa., oversee the care of about 12,000 people, and a typical office visit lasts just 15 minutes.
Because health insurers pay him as little as $45 per visit, Dr. Kilduff and his colleagues say they have little choice but to squeeze as many patients as they can into their day. That makes it virtually impossible to spend time explaining to patients the importance of keeping their blood sugar under control or how to take their medicine. But the insurers’ penny-wise approach can lead to as much as $1 million in hospital bills, if a person with under-treated diabetes has a heart attack.
That is why some of the nation’s insurers are now trying to avoid those high medical bills by taking the longer view. They are giving primary care doctors more help — and more money — to take care of the sickest patients and help prevent them from becoming sicker.
Otherwise, insurers know they risk being overwhelmed by rising health care costs as an older, sicker population copes with serious chronic conditions.
“The essential business model of medical insurance will have to change,” said Dr. Glenn D. Steele Jr., the chief executive of Geisinger Health System, which operates a network of clinics and hospitals in Pennsylvania.
Geisinger is known nationally for its innovative approaches to delivering high-quality care at lower cost. It also owns a health insurance plan that covers about 250,000 people — including many of Dr. Kilduff’s patients in Shavertown.
As an insurer, Geisinger now pays the salaries of extra nurses in doctors’ offices, whose full-time job is to help patients with chronic diseases stay on top of their conditions and, ideally, out of the hospital. The doctors, including Dr. Kilduff, help hire the nurses, who work closely with the doctors to oversee the patients’ care.
The nurses make sure patients who need quick appointments are squeezed in, and they alert the doctors to any early indications of trouble by keeping in close contact with the patients and looking out for the results of patients’ lab tests.
One of Dr. Kilduff’s patients, Rose Ann Cox, 69 years old, began working a few years ago with a Geisinger-paid nurse, Karen Thomas, to control her diabetes, talking by phone at least once a week.  Ms. Cox had gone to the emergency room when her blood sugars were too low, but she has not been in the hospital for about three years now.
“You don’t always think you should call the doctor,” Ms. Cox said.  But she has no qualms about reaching out to the nurse.
The initiative is part of an overall effort by Geisinger and other insurers to create a so-called  medical home — the place where patients’ care is carefully coordinated by a doctor and staff, with particular attention given to the chronically ill.
Geisinger began experimenting with this approach three and a half years ago and now uses it in 37  practices, most of which are part of its own network of doctors’ offices.
But five of the doctors’ offices, including Dr. Kilduff’s, are independent practices that accept Geisinger as one of several insurance plans. Under the arrangement with the outside doctors, Geisinger pays for the nurses and shares with the doctors any savings they can achieve by reducing medical expenses. So far, Geisinger says it is pleased with the early results. In an unpublished review of 2008 data, Geisinger experienced an 18 percent drop in hospital admissions; overall medical expenses fell 7 percent. Geisinger expects to publish a study on its results later this year.
The doctors involved in the Geisinger experiment say they would not hesitate to hospitalize a patient if necessary. Part of the nurses’ work, in fact, is to keep tabs on anyone who is admitted and make sure a treatment plan is in place when a patient is discharged.
Many other insurers are also trying new, similar ways of rewarding primary care doctors.
“What we’re trying to do is get doctors off the traditional fee-for-service hamster wheel,” said Dr. Gus Manocchia, the chief medical officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island, a nonprofit insurer that started a program similar to Geisinger’s earlier this year. “A lot of the Blues plans are at least thinking about this, if they haven’t started it already.”
WellPoint, Aetna and Cigna, which are some of the nation’s largest for-profit insurers, are also flirting with the concept.  In one case, in Texas, a nurse whose salary is paid by Cigna discovered that a diabetic patient was missing check-ups and not filling his prescriptions because he had lost his job. He was insured through his wife, but without his income the couple could no longer afford to pay his share of the cost of prescriptions or the co-payments for the office visit.
The nurse worked with the doctor to find cheaper medicines for the man and arranged for him to pay back his share of the cost of office visits over time.
By getting this patient’s diabetes under control, the insurer very likely avoided paying what could have been a $500,000 or $1 million claim to treat a heart attack or start kidney dialysis, said David Toomey, Cigna’s general manager for north Texas, where the insurer is starting to experiment with such programs.
The same patient had been ignoring telephone calls from Cigna representatives, responding only when someone called from the doctor’s office. “They trust their doctor and there’s a level of distrust with the insurance company,” Mr. Toomey said.
Even though such experiments seem promising, more evidence is needed to show that this model works, said Dr. Jaan Sidorov, a former Geisinger insurance executive who is now a consultant. “We need some research and some outcomes,” he said.
Others also worry that Geisinger, often cited as a national model for health care delivery, may be a tough act to follow. By investing heavily in technology, Geisinger has developed an unusually  sophisticated way of tracking patients, and its own doctors  — unlike many around the nation — have long made use of electronic health records.
“Because Geisinger has a health plan, because of its system, they have the ability to do things that a lot of other insurers or hospitals cannot,” said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan health research group in Washington.
But Mr. Ginsburg says insurers with many customers in a geographic market —  like Blue Cross of Rhode Island, which covers two-thirds of those who are privately insured in the state —  are also in a position to team with local doctors to provide better care.
Geisinger’s willingness to share the savings generated when patients stay out of the hospital may also be rare. But doctors say it is important.
“Two to three thousand dollars just doesn’t do it,” said Mark Stephens, the chief executive of InterMountain Medical Group, the medical practice of 52 physicians where Dr. Kilduff works.
Geisinger offered InterMountain Medical at least half of any money saved from preventing readmissions to the hospital, among other measures. “The upside was so strong that it just got everyone’s attention,” Mr. Stephens said.
His group, which cared for 900 patients insured by Geisinger, received $320,000 last year, which he said was divided among the whole staff, even the receptionists. The reward was based, too,  on various measures of the quality of care delivered.
“We wanted the team to succeed,” said Janet Tomcavage, a nurse who helps oversee the program for Geisinger. “We wanted to put the dollars on the table that are meaningful.”
Other insurers may not be so generous. While WellPoint is willing to pay for an additional nurse in the doctor’s office, for example, so far it has not chosen to pay the doctor anything extra.
And Dr. Albert Puerini, chairman of the Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians Corporation, says he has had no luck in persuading his state’s other major insurer, UnitedHealth Group, to talk about creating a program similar to Blue Cross’s, although the insurer says it has other initiatives in the state.
But such efforts are increasingly necessary, if patients are going to get better care, Dr. Puerini.  “None of this is going to improve,” he said, “unless plans and physicians learn to work together.”

The rules significantly scale back proposed requirements that the health care industry had denounced as unrealistic.
The Department of Health and Human Services said doctors and hospitals could receive as much as $27 billion over the next 10 years to buy equipment to computerize patients’ medical records. A doctor can receive up to $44,000 under Medicare and $63,750 under Medicaid, while a hospital can receive millions of dollars, depending on its size.
Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.
Dr. Donald M. Berwick, who was sworn in Monday as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said electronic health records would lead to “better, smoother care, more reliable care.”
Even though American health care is known for the use of advanced technology in treating patients, doctors and hospitals have been slow to replace paper records with electronic records.
“Only 20 percent of doctors and 10 percent of hospitals use even basic electronic health records,” said Kathleen Sebelius,  secretary of health and human services.
Richard J. Umbdenstock, the president of the American Hospital Association, said the final rules were an improvement over the proposal. But he said he was still concerned that a majority of hospitals could not jump over the hurdles  to get federal aid.
Dr. Ralph G. Brindis,  president of the American College of Cardiology, applauded the rules, saying they promised to “increase the quality of care while reducing cost.” Cardiologists have been “early adopters” of electronic records, he said.
Dr. David Blumenthal, the national coordinator for health information technology, said doctors and hospitals would be defaulting on their “professional responsibilities” if they did not use electronic health records. Such technology can reduce medical errors, including mistakes that kill people, he said.
The main criticism of the rules proposed by the Obama administration in January was that they took an “all or nothing” approach. Doctors could not have received any federal bonus payments unless they met 25 criteria, or objectives, and hospitals would have been required to meet 23.
Standards in the new rules are less demanding and more flexible. Doctors will have to meet 15 specific requirements, plus 5 chosen from a list of 10 objectives. Hospitals will have to meet 14 requirements, plus 5 chosen from a menu of 10 goals.
Doctors, for example, will have to use electronic systems to record patients’ demographic data (sex, race, date of birth); their height, weight and blood pressure; their medications; and their smoking behavior.
To meet the new standards, doctors will have to transmit 40 percent of prescriptions electronically. Under the proposal, 75 percent of prescriptions had to be sent electronically.
“We are delaying some of the more ambitious requirements,” Dr. Blumenthal said. He described the new standards as “ambitious but achievable” and said they would put doctors “on an escalator” toward full adoption of electronic records.
Even pioneers in the use of electronic records, like Kaiser Permanente, Intermountain Healthcare in Utah and the Partners HealthCare System in Boston had said they could not meet all the proposed standards.
The final rules do not guarantee that doctors and hospitals can electronically exchange clinical information on patients. The rules do require health care providers to work toward that goal, widely seen as a way to improve the coordination of care and avoid the  duplication of tests.

Not long ago, I found myself doing the same with a friend who prides himself on being a well-informed patient. But instead of an overwhelmingly enthusiastic or even mildly interested response, my friend stared at me blankly.
“What in the world are you talking about?” he finally asked. “A hospice? A halfway house? Some kind of group home for patients?”
I explained that a patient-centered medical home can be any primary care doctor’s office, but it is run with a different philosophy. Care is team-based, preventive and comprehensive, rather than one-on-one, fee-for-service or managed. Record keeping and sharing is seamless and electronic, rather than unwieldy and paper-based. Clinicians from the team are easily accessible in person, on the phone or via the Internet within 24 hours, rather than hidden behind labyrinthine automatic answering services and overbooked clinic schedules.
My friend suddenly became very interested.
Call it a P.R. issue, an information disconnect or simply an unfortunate choice of a name, but in all the discussions about patient-centered medical homes, one group of individuals has been conspicuously missing: the patients themselves. And it’s hard not to notice the irony; in a model of care premised on the strength of the patient-doctor relationship, few people other than doctors and experts are even sure what it is or how it affects their care.
Now, as dozens of pilot projects across the country are transforming traditional doctors’ offices into medical homes and putting this theory of practice to the test, one thing has become apparent: even this most promising of reforms is unlikely to take hold without the active involvement of patients.
The need to get patients involved was made startlingly clear last month when the American Academy of Family Physicians, a national medical society devoted to primary care, and TransforMED, a nonprofit consulting firm created by the society to help physicians turn their practices into medical homes, published the first report on their national demonstration project. Beginning in 2006, 36 traditional primary care offices began adopting the hallmarks of patient-centered medical home practices. They installed electronic medical record systems and reorganized deeply entrenched scheduling routines. Teams made up of nurses, medical managers, physician assistants and doctors, rather than a single physician authority figure, began working with patients. And care was focused not on single acute episodes of illness but on the patients’ comprehensive and ongoing management.
As the study progressed, the researchers found that the vast majority of doctors’ offices could successfully incorporate most of the changes into their practice, and early signs of the model’s success were promising. Quality of care and preventive health ratings revealed small improvements. Office staff became more streamlined, efficient and satisfied. Most notably, physicians were more content than ever before with their work, despite still having to deal with an unchanged fee-for-service or managed care reimbursement system. The doctors’ enthusiasm persisted even after the study closed, with many maintaining contact with one another through a listserv and twice-yearly self-organized meetings.
Yet despite these successes, there was also one unexpected early finding: the patients were unhappy.
Yes, they were getting into their doctors’ offices more quickly and were being followed more closely than ever before, but many patients reported feeling disoriented. Some felt displaced as they saw the old one-to-one doctor-patient interactions replaced with one-to-three or one-to-four relationships involving not only the doctor but also a whole host of other providers. As offices switched from paper-based to electronic medical records, other patients reacted to the distracted clinicians who seemed more focused on learning the new computer system than on listening to them. Satisfaction fell because, like my friend, few patients were cognizant of, much less involved in, the changes going on around them.
In working so hard to adopt changes on their patients’ behalf, clinicians had temporarily lost their focus on the patients themselves.
“The Achilles heel of all of this is a lack of patient understanding and engagement,” said Dr. Terry McGeeney, a primary care physician and chief executive of TransforMED. “Patient-centered medical homes are a massive paradigm shift in how primary care practices function.” As one of the first national studies of patient-centered medical homes, “we were starting at ground zero, and we weren’t aware of what we needed to do other than support the physicians’ personal motivation.”
With the patient survey results in hand, the researchers began encouraging medical practices to involve patients in the changes. They asked clinicians to discuss the premise of medical homes with their patients and encouraged them to create patient advisory councils, groups of patients who would meet regularly with clinicians to discuss how their needs might be better served.
“We were surprised by how many patients wanted to be part of it,” said Dr. Barbara Saul, a primary care physician in Troy, Mich., who was initially part of the study. “Patients would say over and over, ‘It’s about time you started these kind of changes.’ ”
The researchers also created a five-minute, 20-question assessment survey that asks patients for their views on patient-provider communication, clinician access and care of the whole person. Practices could use the survey regularly to gauge the effects of any changes, adjusting and refining what they do according to the patients’ experiences and not what the clinicians might believe was most important to them.
“Nowadays a lot of patients end up getting things done to them, almost forced on them,” said Dr. Joseph Mambu, a practicing family physician in Lower Gwynedd, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. “I think if we could see a situation the way a patient does, a lot of the things we do would not be done.” Based on his experience with the national demonstration project, Dr. Mambu went on to help create a national coalition of patient advocacy groups, payers and providers, the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative, devoted to creating more medical homes across the country.
While Dr. McGeeney and his co-investigators believe that such work and ongoing research will yield even more significant results in terms of improving the quality and decreasing the costs of primary care, the lesson from this first experiment is clear.
“The model can improve quality while becoming more efficient, but practices need support,” Dr. McGeeney observed. “Providers need to want to provide this kind of care, payers need to pay for this kind of care and, most importantly, patients need to demand and expect this kind of care.”

Democratic lawmakers and a few Republicans have denounced the rules, saying they fall short of offering patients the fullest protections possible. Hospitals and insurance companies, seeking to maintain greater control over patient notification, generally support the rules. The White House finds itself caught in the middle.
The rules specify when doctors, hospitals and insurers must tell patients about the improper use or disclosure of information in their medical records. Such breaches appear to have become more frequent, with the growing use of health information technology, social media and the Internet.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, issued temporary rules, with the force of law, in August last year. After analyzing comments from the public, she developed final rules and submitted them to the White House Office of Management and Budget for approval in May.
At the urging of the White House, Ms. Sebelius recently withdrew the  rules to allow for further consideration.
“We decided to pull it back,” said Georgina C. Verdugo, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. “We had second thoughts. We hope to issue a final regulation this fall.”
The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a watchdog group, estimates that more than five million people have been affected by breaches of medical information in the last 18 months.
Causes include the theft of laptop computers, the loss of paper records, the posting of data on Web sites and the curiosity of hospital employees snooping for information on sports stars and other celebrities.
Congress increased privacy safeguards when it provided tens of billions of dollars to promote the use of electronic health records under the economic recovery bill signed by President Obama in February 2009.
In writing the temporary rules, Ms. Sebelius closely followed the text of the law except in one important respect: Health care providers and health insurance plans would have to notify patients of a privacy breach only if they found that the violation posed “a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individual.”
“No notification is required” if a hospital or an insurer believes, after a risk assessment, that the patient will not be harmed, the rules said.
Deven McGraw, director of the Health Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties group, said the standard proposed by the administration was severely flawed.
“Harm is in the eye of the beholder,” Ms. McGraw said. “How does a hospital or an insurance company know whether an improper disclosure will harm an employee’s chances for promotion or endanger a victim of domestic abuse?”
Defending its proposal, the Department of Health and Human Services had said that some kind of “harm threshold” was essential. Otherwise, it said, consumers might be flooded with notices warning about innocuous or insignificant violations of privacy.
Some senior members of Congress said they had explicitly considered and rejected a standard like the one adopted by Ms. Sebelius. “This is not consistent with Congressional intent,” they said in a letter to her.
The letter was signed by six lawmakers including Representatives Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Joe L. Barton of Texas, the senior Republican on the committee; and Pete Stark, Democrat of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.
Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said hospitals and insurers were often reluctant to notify patients. “Few things could be more damaging to an institution’s reputation than having to admit that it has lost or somehow allowed others to intrude into its patients’ private medical data,” she said.
In July, Colorado notified 110,000 Medicaid recipients that information about them was on a computer hard drive taken “without permission” from a state government office. The data indicated whether, for example, women were receiving prenatal care or treatment for breast or cervical cancer.
In the last nine months, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee has notified nearly one million people that their privacy could be compromised by the theft of 57 computer hard drives from a call center in Chattanooga. The hard drives included recordings of telephone calls, Social Security numbers and diagnostic information about some subscribers.
In Massachusetts, four hospitals acknowledged this month that paper records for thousands of their patients had been improperly thrown out at a public dump north of Boston. The records included results of tests performed by pathologists and clinical laboratories.
“We were shocked and outraged,” said Nancy A. Coley, a spokeswoman for one of the hospitals, Holyoke Medical Center. “We wondered how our records could be out in the Boston area 90 miles away. We found that the records came from a billing agency used by a group of pathologists who did work for the hospital.”
In California, Ralph E. Montaño, a spokesman for the State Department of Public Health, said officials had substantiated 2,093 violations of medical privacy in the last 20 months, including 26 “malicious breaches.”
The department has imposed $1.1 million in fines on six hospitals and is still investigating hundreds of cases, Mr. Montaño said.
Courtney Berlin, a spokeswoman for Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, Calif., said several hospital employees were recently disciplined for “using Facebook to post their personal discussions concerning hospital patients.”
The University of Texas at Arlington said it had recently notified 27,000 people of a possible “data compromise” involving their prescription drug records. The information, including drug names and diagnostic codes, was stored on a computer file server that was not properly secured, university officials said.

Named Bush,541a654d38f0d80959e6c931,"subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, subject:Reform and Reorganization",Business,0.0,Small Business,"Jonathan Bush, nephew of one former president and cousin of another, built a small medical practice into a national enterprise with nearly 1,200 employees.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/business/smallbusiness/09sbiz.html,1295,"Jonathan Bush, nephew of one former president and cousin of another, built a small medical practice into a national enterprise with nearly 1,200 employees.","In the world of health care innovation, the founder and chief executive of Athenahealth has an outsize name. In part, that’s because his name is Jonathan Bush, and he is the nephew of one former president   and the cousin of another. But it’s also because his company has mastered the intricacies of the doctor-insurer relationship and become a player in the emerging medical records industry.
Based in Watertown, Mass., Athenahealth offers a suite of administrative services for medical practices. It collects payments from insurers and patients, and it manages electronic health records and  patient communication systems. All of this is done remotely through the Internet — or “in the cloud,” as Mr. Bush puts it. Doctors don’t have to install or manage software or pay licensing fees; instead, Athenahealth keeps a percentage of the revenue.
Lately, Athenahealth’s stock price has been hammered by news of an internal accounting audit and missed earnings expectations. By July its shares had fallen by more than half from their January high. (They have since reversed some of that decline.)
Even so, the company’s sales have grown substantially over  the last couple of years. While the bill collection service still accounts for most of the sales, the company’s fastest-growing business has been its electronic records segment, which has benefited from provisions in the 2009 stimulus law and this year’s health care overhaul.
What follows is a condensed version of a conversation with Mr. Bush about how he built a small medical practice into a national enterprise with nearly 1,200 employees, and how the new health care law is likely to affect businesses  —  small firms as well as his own.
Q. Athenahealth got its start when you purchased a birthing practice in California back in 1997. But you’re not a doctor — why did you buy it?
A. You know, Bush family noblesse oblige. I wanted to take advantage of all this education and support I’ve had and do well by doing good, and health care seemed like a place that no one else in my family had been much. A new approach to health care seemed to me to be the oil fields of 1997.
Q. So what led you into the administrative services business?
A. I ran into all of the problems that medical practices ran into, all of which were unrelated to medical care. I couldn’t get my claims paid, I couldn’t make payroll because of all of these ridiculous regulatory and insurance rules that were changing all the time and were very esoteric, and the technical infrastructure to connect and move around was incredibly poor.
We had 13 little offices up and down San Diego County, and they were running up against scale-based obstacles, things that would need real management infrastructure and capital to do properly. So we built a little Web site for ourselves called Athenanet, and pretty soon all the doctors in the neighborhood wanted to be on Athenanet.
In fact, when we were trying to raise venture capital to go do more birthing centers, and it wasn’t happening, one of the venture capitalists said in passing that he would give me $11 million for an unlimited license to Athenanet [laughs]. And I think our pre-money valuation for the whole company was $7 million. It was as if a budding, small airline wakes up to find that they invented the Sabre system.
 Q. Your revenue has grown 40 percent in each of the last two years, from $98 million to $189 million —  
A. Don’t you love it?
Q. Well, not as much as you do.
A. And yet, the Street hates me. I don’t know.
Q. What’s going on in the health care industry to deliver that kind of growth to you? 
A. We are a disruptive technology. We are the only cloud-based service in an industry segment full of sclerotic, enormous, personality-free corporations that have been in business making 90 percent margins doing nothing for decades and decades.
Q. What keeps other companies from building cloud-based systems? 
A. For software companies, the biggest barrier to entry is that they give up their business model. Those companies would get hammered on Wall Street if they started selling a service that they have to deliver at a loss for five years. In terms of new entrants, there are two things that we’ve done that would take a good decade to replicate. One, we’ve built out the health care Internet. We’ve been building connections into insurance companies and laboratories and hospital medical records for years and years and years.
And the other barrier to entry is that rules engine. Every time a doctor anywhere in the country gets a claim denied, we have analysts ask the Five Whys.  When we get to root cause, we write a new rule into Athenanet and from that day on, no other doctor gets that particular denial from that particular insurance company ever again. We now know of 40 million ways that a doctor can have a claim denied in the United States. The average practice has to rework about 35 percent of their claims, and we only have to rework about 5 percent of ours.
Q. What’s the prognosis for bill collecting under health care reform?
A. Well, there’s going to be new connectors and a whole series of new insurance products that will be managed by the states’ health insurance commissioners. And the law provides for every state to do all of these its own way, so they will have their own rules and regulations, and each state will do it differently. That sounds like springtime in Complexity Land.
Q. What do you think will happen to the total cost of health care under reform?
A. Oh, it’s going to go through the roof! It’s widely accepted that this is not a cost-reform bill — it’s an access bill. It’s in fact a cost-expansion bill.
Q. Last year, Dr. Atul Gawande made a pretty cogent case, writing in The New Yorker, not just that the small pilot projects in the reform would control costs but that they are the only way to control costs in an industry as sprawling as health care. 
A. I e-mail a lot with Atul and he’s a product of the Borg,   at some big institution, and thinks in terms of papers and grants from Washington. I totally agree that demonstration projects are what changes a market, but outside of the Borg, we call those businesses. I suppose Washington trying to be an innovator also is fine, but at some point the demonstration project is going to have to be consumers using their judgment about which things they want.
Q. If you were still a small company, or if you were starting a business now, would health care reform help or hurt you as an employer? 
A. Well, certainly the idea that somebody else is going to pay a lot of my health insurance cost, at the micro level, makes a lot of sense. It’d be great, yeah, thanks — anything else you want to pay for? If you actually ever have to start paying this thing, all of this accelerates the increase in the cost. Eventually, consumers will need to eat a big part of their health care cost, because health care will fundamentally consume the entire G.D.P. in the not-too-distant future.
Everybody agrees that this is good in the way that it creates engagement in society by those who are outcasts. So if you’re feeling like you don’t want to believe in America anymore because you don’t have health insurance, well, now you can believe a little more. It’s bad in terms of the macro economy. But I don’t know which one is more important in the grand scheme for today.

You know, people you actually see in person regularly — friends, relatives, co-workers, neighbors.
“It’s a very old thing that we do, like ants, arranging ourselves to live in social structures,” says Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis, a Harvard professor who studies health and social networks. “Really, humans have arranged themselves into networks for hundreds and thousands of years.”
Dr. Christakis and his research partner, James H. Fowler, an associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, created an international uproar in 2007 when they published a study on obesity. In it, they reported that fat could be catching — spreading through social ties. One of the study’s findings was that a person’s chance of becoming obese increased 57 percent if the person had a friend who became obese. Another surprising finding of the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, was that one’s chance of becoming obese was influenced not only by the weight gain of friends but also by friends of friends who gained weight.
Since then, the researchers have examined how other health-related behaviors and conditions — drug use and sleeplessness among teenagers, smoking and happiness — spread through social networks. And they have published a book explaining their work, titled “Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives.”
Now Dr. Christakis and Professor Fowler, as well as other scientists, are turning their attention to a new research area: how to harness social networks to promote public health.
Of course, we already know that people can and do change their health habits when they seek out and participate in new social groupings. Weight Watchers, anyone?
But how do we extract information from existing social networks to improve public health?
One method is to identify social connectors, people who spend time with more friends than average — and are thus exposed to more germs and are more likely to be among the first to contract contagious diseases like the flu. If health officials could find and track those social butterflies, they could tap into an early-detection system for epidemics and figure out whom to vaccinate first in order to slow the spread of disease.
Last winter, Dr. Christakis and Professor Fowler tried just such a strategy — monitoring people’s friends — to track the spread of H1N1 flu at Harvard. They monitored 744 undergraduates who were either selected at random or were named as friends by the randomly selected students. Then they followed the undergrads, using their electronic medical records, to identify which students went to the university health service complaining of flu symptoms.
The method is based on  “the friendship paradox” — the counterintuitive idea that your friends have more friends than you do. In other words, you’re more likely to be friends with popular people than with loners. And those popular people tend to be closer to the core of a social network.
In the Harvard study, published Wednesday in the scientific journal PLoS One, the flu developed about two weeks earlier in the friend group than in the randomly selected group. The results, the study leaders say, indicate that public health officials could use friend monitoring like sentinel nodes in the human body, as an early-detection system for disease.
Friend monitoring systems could also be used to identify flu trends faster than methods now used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — or on Google, for that matter — because the friend system pinpoints signs of an epidemic before it peaks in the general population, Professor Fowler says.
“This method, although we have studied H1N1, could be applied to anything that spreads — smoking, weight gain,” he says.
Some researchers are also studying how a social network’s structure affects the speed at which people adopt and stick to health habits.
To that end, Damon Centola, an assistant professor of economic sociology at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., conducted an experiment with more than 1,500 people. He created a Web-based health forum where they had access to and could rate health information sites.
Professor Centola then randomly assigned participants to one of two social network designs: one was set up like a residential neighborhood, with clusters of overlapping ties among neighbors; the other was a casual network where people did not share social ties.
Each participant was matched with other members, called “health buddies.” Although people could not contact their buddies directly, they received e-mail from the system about their buddies’ activities on the site.
The neighborhood structure turned out to be much better than the random social network at prompting people in the study to join and participate in the health forum, according to Professor Centola’s report, published this month in the journal Science. More important, Professor Centola says, the more e-mails that people received about the activities of their health buddies, the more often they returned to the forum.
IN the real world, he says, this means the amount of social reinforcement you give to people to improve their health habits may be more important than who is encouraging them to do so. In other words, a local community network of friends and neighbors may be more important than a remote celebrity spokesman in stopping the spread of, say, sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers.
“It makes a bigger difference how you connect people than who is there in influencing desirable behaviors,” Professor Centola says.
It also tells us that while weight gain among our friends and friends’ friends can make us fatter, our close connections may also lead us to better health choices, like going to the gym more often or stir-frying more vegetables.
But if we are to make lasting changes in our health habits, Dr. Fowler says, we may need social reinforcement in which our friends, not to mention our friends’ friends, change their habits with us.
And that’s no small order for a social network.

It seems straightforward. Just combine technology skills with investment money, and then develop innovative products. But to date, the push for a digital revolution in doctors’ offices has brought mostly frustration for the many companies big and small that are trying to conquer the field.
Just ask the Doerr brothers — John Doerr, the well-known venture capitalist who was an early backer of Google and Amazon, and Dr. Tom Doerr, a physician and software designer.
Dr. Doerr founded a software company in 1999, beginning with an electronic prescribing product and later adding electronic health records. His brother is the largest investor. After more than a decade, the venture has fewer than 500 doctors using its software.
The experience, Mr. Doerr said, has been “a long, slow march.” And Dr. Doerr conceded, “It’s been a lot harder getting to a business that is self-sustaining than I had imagined.”
But the Obama administration’s economic stimulus package contained an ambitious program to encourage the market for electronic health records, with billions in incentive payments to buy and use digital patient records — and eventually penalties for the failure to do so.
The Doerrs’ software company is only one of many hoping to cash in on the national mandate for digital medical records. The companies range from  giants like General Electric to specialists like Athenahealth that cater to small physician practices.
They, like the Doerrs, are betting that the law will help create a turning point for the economics of digital health records, opening the door to rapid adoption by doctors and a thriving business at last.
The brothers are also betting that Internet technology and Apple’s iPad can make electronic records far easier to use and less expensive. Last week, they introduced a new product, Nimble, to allow doctors to manage patient information by connecting their iPads to data centers managed by the Doerrs’ software company, ClearPractice.
The Doerrs’ aging start-up is unusual in that it has evolved to extend its reach in health care beyond technology. The lessons it has learned along the way are a microcosm of the challenge of applying technology to health care.
To attack the problem of wayward financial incentives, the Doerrs bought a Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization, Essence Healthcare, in 2007, and shifted it toward paying doctors for helping make patients healthier. It now covers 50,000 people in six states.
They also built up a medical analytics software company, which tracks procedures and patient results for payers, enabling them to manage outcomes instead of just costs. The software also mines data to help hospitals and doctors make more informed decisions about treatments.
Their target market is doctors in small practices, with 10 physicians or less — where digital records are used  least. More than 70 percent of the nation’s doctors are in such small practices.
The Doerrs’ three companies are part of the Essence Group, based in suburban St. Louis, not far from where brothers grew up. Dr. Doerr, 53, is co-founder and head of clinical strategy of Essence, and Mr. Doerr, 59, is the largest shareholder.
Though a small private company, Essence has attracted the attention of some experts. Intrigued, Dr. Denis A. Cortese, former chief executive of Mayo Clinic and a professor at Arizona State University, joined the Essence board two months ago. It is trying to bring to small physician practices, he said, the kind of health care championed at Mayo.
“These guys may or may not be successful, but they’ve got the right ideas,” Dr. Cortese said.
The goal, Dr. Doerr explained, is to deliver the better care and lower costs achieved by some large health care groups without being one. Essence, he said, is trying to combine technology tools, cooperative relationships between doctors and insurers, and financial incentives to create the “virtual equivalent” of an integrated system.
The goal also, of course, is to make money. Essence, though, does not have the look of a big winner anytime soon. It has 330 employees and yearly revenue of about $450 million. But the vast majority of the revenue comes from the Medicare insurer, which is like a regulated utility with modest profits.
If the Doerrs’ venture is going to become a money-spinner someday, it will come from software, a business that can grow rapidly and profitably, if successful. For its new offering, ClearPractice worked closely with Apple to develop the Nimble, a service tailored for the iPad.
Using Nimble, doctors do not need other computers in their offices, since most of the software and patient information resides on remote computers in data centers managed by ClearPractice. A doctor’s iPad connects to the patient data and software wirelessly, over the Internet, as if in a computer “cloud,” as this fast-growing model of computing is known.
Doctors pay a subscription fee of up to $499 a month if they choose all the ClearPractice offerings — electronic prescribing, electronic health records and billing software.
“With the right software that is cloud-based, the iPad is going to be transformational in health care,” Mr. Doerr said.
The right technology, medical experts say, can potentially overcome two major hurdles to the adoption of electronic health records by doctors: cost and complexity. Those obstacles are most pronounced in the market of doctors in small practices that the Doerrs are pursuing.
About one in five doctors now uses digital health records. But the percentage is far lower in small practices, while in larger, integrated health groups — Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic and others — all use digital records.
The larger groups are big enough to afford the investment in electronic records, training and technical support. But they also use the electronic patient data as a tool to better manage patients with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart diseases, so they are healthier and less apt to require costly hospital care.
The groups use that performance-improvement data to market themselves to insurers and employers, and many are insurers themselves. So they have considerable economic incentive to  use electronic records.
Yet such larger groups provide less than  15 percent of health care in America. For the rest, the dominant economic model is fee for service. The incentive is for more of everything — more visits, more tests, more pills, more surgeries. The sicker the patient, the more lucrative.
For Mr. Doerr, his private health care venture has been an education. “Our health care system,” he said, “is an absolutely dysfunctional circle where none of the participants — patients, payers or providers — are linked together in any kind of rational economic system.”
Until recently, doctors in small practices had no incentive to invest in electronic health records. They would bear the costs, but savings would go to insurers.
But with the federal stimulus package, the economic barrier will be lowered. The government plans to spend $19 billion in incentive payments — up to $44,000 per doctor, and gave practices five years to adopt electronic records before penalties begin.
As an investment, Essence is a world apart from the classic Silicon Valley venture-capital mentality of finding the Next Big Thing. Mr. Doerr, who joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers three decades ago, has done that as successfully as anyone.
“Health care is a complex system, where the improvements and effects are felt over time,” said Esther Dyson, an analyst, investor and friend of Mr. Doerr’s. “So in that sense, this is very different from conventional venture capital investments. It’s not going to take off quickly.”
Still, at the headquarters in Maryland Heights, Mo., Mr. Doerr’s  team  is thinking big. The chief executive of the Essence Group is Frank Ingari, who has known Mr. Doerr for 20 years, and headed a computer networking company that Kleiner had backed and helped take public.
Mr. Ingari, who is working Silicon Valley-style 80-hour weeks, speaks of health care technology as a “tremendous opportunity” both as a business and as a benefit to society.  “This is a missionary endeavor,” he said.

Here are a few basic facts that Americans need to keep in mind before they go to the polls, and afterward. First, most aspects of the reform do not go into effect until 2014. Second, things are indeed bad out there: The costs of medical care and insurance premiums are (still) rising,  and some employers are (still) dropping coverage. But for that, you should blame the long-standing health care crisis and the current bad economy. Health reform is supposed to help with these problems.
Here is a look at the claims being made on the campaign trail — and the distortions they contain:
PURE NONSENSE: John Raese, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, is claiming that the law will require patients to go through a bureaucrat or panel to reach a doctor. That is flat out untrue. You will still choose your own doctor or insurance plan without interference. Nor, despite other claims, will the law provide subsidized insurance to illegal immigrants. They are precluded from using even their own money to buy policies on new exchanges.
The Obama administration will not be compiling a federal health record on all citizens, including each individual’s body mass index, as Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican running for a House seat in upstate New York, has claimed on her Web site. The administration is offering incentives to doctors to record various vital statistics in electronic medical records and report the data in the aggregate, to help understand national health trends.
WE CALL THAT CAPITALISM:  Republican politicians never tire of denouncing health care reform as a “government takeover” — or socialism. What is true is that the law relies heavily on private insurers and employers to provide coverage. It also strengthens regulation of those insurers and provides government subsidies to help low-  and middle-income people buy private insurance on the exchanges.
Those exchanges will promote greater competition among insurers and a better deal for consumers, which last time we checked was a fundamental of capitalism.
WHAT ABOUT MCDONALD’S? Conservative commentators pounced after the fast food chain and several other large employers that provide skimpy, low-cost policies to their workers warned that they might drop their health plans entirely if forced to comply with the new law. They particularly objected to a requirement that they begin raising the low annual limits on what their plans are willing to pay for health care.
In response, the administration has granted some 30  waivers for one year (Rush Limbaugh promptly accused the administration of allowing these employers to “break the law”) and has signaled willingness to smooth out other bumps on the road toward full reform. In 2014, all plans will have to meet minimal standards and large employers will have to provide coverage or pay a stiff fine.
WHAT ABOUT MY PREMIUMS?  Some Republicans are also claiming that health reform is driving up premiums. There have been sharp increases in some states, primarily in response to soaring medical costs. Some insurers may also be trying to increase their profits before the reform law holds them in check. A few very welcome provisions that take effect early, like requiring insurers to cover preventive care without cost-sharing, will play a minor role in premium increases for next year.
Reform has also energized federal officials and many state regulators to challenge and force down big increases sought by insurers. The Justice Department just filed suit against Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan for allegedly using its market power to drive up costs for its competitors and its own subscribers.
MEDICARE SCARE TACTICS:  Republican candidates routinely and cynically charge that the reform law will “cut” $500 billion from Medicare — leaving the clear implication that benefits will be reduced. In reality, the law will slow the rate of increase in payments to health care providers over the next decade, and benefits for most beneficiaries will be as good or better than they are now.
The only beneficiaries apt to see a change are those enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans that will lose their unjustified subsides. Many of these beneficiaries, roughly a quarter of the Medicare population, may have to pay more for their plans or may lose the extra benefits, like gym memberships or dental care, that the subsidies pay for. Some inefficient plans will die out, but the efficient private plans will compete successfully with traditional Medicare — on an even playing field.
MEDICAID SCARE TACTICS: Republican governors are complaining bitterly that reform will force them to expand their Medicaid programs. What they are not saying is that the federal government will pick up the vast bulk of the added expense to cover millions of vulnerable Americans. States that do not want this largess will be shortchanging the health of their poorest citizens, who will continue to use costly — to the state and the taxpayers — emergency rooms for routine health care.
WHAT THEY’RE NOT SAYING: Health care reform has already brought substantial benefits, mostly starting in late September. Insurers are now barred from dropping coverage after a beneficiary becomes sick. Dependents can stay on their parents’ policies until age 26. Insurers must cover preventive services and annual checkups without cost-sharing. Lifetime limits on how much insurance plans will pay for treatment are gone.
The major benefits start in 2014, when tens of millions of the uninsured will gain coverage through Medicaid or by buying private coverage — with government help for low- and middle-income Americans — on the new competitive exchanges. If you lose your job, you will no longer lose access to insurance. And with government help the coverage should be affordable.
Far too few Democrats are explaining this on the campaign trail. The barrage of attack ads are hard to push back against. But the voters need to know that health care reform will give all Americans real security.

Thus far, however, it  has brought administrative chaos to the mental health and substance abuse services in the city.
Documents obtained by The Bay Citizen under a California Public Records Act request show that shortly after installing  Avatar, providers struggled to use the new software, causing health officials to lose track of millions of dollars of services.
Officials are scrambling to fill in the missing data to meet deadlines to qualify for reimbursement from the state.
The department has a $310 million budget for mental health and substance abuse, and  San Francisco General Hospital, city-run clinics, community organizations and private therapists provide the services. Medi-Cal reimburses the department  for some of those costs.
Problems related to the conversion to Avatar delayed for months the payment of about $450,000 to individual therapists, Anne Okubo, the health department’s deputy financial officer, told the San Francisco Health Commission on Tuesday night. The department was forced to use a third party to make the payments, which are still incomplete.
In addition, some therapists and social workers report that the demands of the new software have cut into the time they spend with patients, eroding the quality of care.
In an Aug. 19 e-mail headed “problems with Avatar,” Steven Schreibman, a social worker at Sunset Mental Health, a city-run clinic, wrote that the software required “excessive time charting and performing data entry” and had led to “shorter sessions with clients” and “delays in our capacity to accept new clients.”
Senior health department officials and Netsmart Technologies, Avatar’s developer, said the problems were glitches that were to be expected as the city made the transition to a more efficient record-keeping system.
“We knew it was going to be rough initially, because there is a learning curve,” said Jo Robinson, who heads the Community Health Behavioral Services division, where Avatar was introduced.
Kevin Scalia, a Netsmart Technologies executive vice president, said that he does not see this as a big problem. “From our point of view,” he said, “everything is going swimmingly.”
During the Health Commission meeting on Tuesday, health department officials accepted congratulations for putting Avatar in use on time without going over budget. The system, which encompasses billing and clinical documentation, has 2,600 users in San Francisco and is used in 25 of California’s 58 counties.
In San Francisco, Avatar replaced three software systems used by Community Health Behavioral Services, as well as paper charts.
Department managers told the Health Commission that Avatar would lead to “improved client care” and had “positive fiscal impacts,” but they acknowledged there had been problems.
In September, the department compared the cost of mental health and substance services reported by the hospital, clinics and organizations in March, before the software was put into use, to those reported in July using the new system.
The data showed that the mental health services reported had plunged 55 percent. Substance abuse services reported fell  32 percent. The large discrepancies caused alarm because they  indicated that providers were having problems using the software, according to documents and interviews.
“Substance abuse — serious problems!” Ms. Okubo, the deputy financial officer, wrote in a Sept. 1 e-mail to health department officials and Netsmart Technologies, which is based in New York. “Almost all providers with Avatar data have huge reductions in revenues. It’s pretty clear none are getting Avatar.”
A month later, as more providers gained access and proficiency with the software, the picture improved, but significant discrepancies remained.
“Everyone was learning, and we were fumbling,” said Ms. Robinson, director of Community Health Behavioral Services.
Gathering the correct data quickly is crucial for the city to be reimbursed by Medi-Cal. The department expects to receive $90.9 million from Medi-Cal this fiscal year for mental health and substance abuse. It  is racing to clean up the July data before deadlines in November and December to submit the correct information to the state for reimbursement.
Ms. Okubo is confident that will happen. “The expectation is that the system will be billing at the same rate,” she said.
But some organizations worry that the services they are providing will not be fully reflected in the new system.
At the Health Commission meeting, Estela Garcia, executive director of the Instituto Familiar de la Raza, a community organization that  provides mental health services, asked the commission to protect organizations like hers from any financial liability related to Avatar.
“I want a hold-harmless policy until the system is fully up and running,” Ms. Garcia  said.
How long that will take is unclear. One mental health program director, who would not allow his name to be used because it could jeopardize his relationship with the department, said his staff had gone to repeated training sessions to try to get up to speed.
“Avatar turns out to be a total disaster,” the program director said. “What is going to happen to contracted agencies if their billing is short at the end of the fiscal year as compared to the terms of their contract, because they can’t master Avatar?”
Some providers say the demands of the new system detract from the care they are able to provide.
A psychologist who works with a community organization under contract to the city, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was afraid of losing his job, said he used to do all his charting and billing on paper and was told that the new system would be more efficient. So far, that has not proved to be the case, he said.
“We are seeing the same number of patients,” he said, “but we are providing substantially less service to them, because the time we are now spending just to do the billing alone, not to mention the record keeping, it’s become the majority of our time.”
Greg Cross, a field representative for Service Employees International Union Local 1021, which represents hundreds of social workers, psychologists and counselors who work for the city, said he had met with officials to discuss Avatar’s impact on workload as well as performance expectations.
At the Health Commission meeting, Fred McGregor, the health department’s senior information technology manager for community programs, said  that the department was aware that providers find the demands of Avatar “a little onerous” and that it was working on a redesign to make clinical assessment more efficient.
Mr. Schreibman, the social worker, made it clear in his August e-mail that change was needed quickly.
“The kind and amount of work skill involved using this software represents a change in our job description,” he wrote. “This is not the job we accepted when we chose to do clinical work for the city.”

In 1890, it was cameras. Today, cookies.","HOW far does consumer privacy protection lag behind data-collection systems, those advanced technologies that media companies use to gather, share and profit from our personal information?
Too far, according to two privacy advocates.
“Solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress,” the privacy experts wrote in the Harvard Law Review. “In this, as in other branches of commerce, the supply creates demand,” they added; and that demand, they noted, ends up broadcasting our private matters in public spheres.
Sound familiar?
The review article, written in 1890 by the young lawyers Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, concerned the spread of that era’s viral technology: snapshot photography. Newspaper photographers, the lawyers wrote, were feeding an “unseemly gossip” industry by taking and publishing candid shots of people without their consent.
Before the advent of the camera, explains Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, newspaper photographers would have had difficulty carting heavy daguerreotype equipment and using it to peer over people’s back garden fences.
“But once you went to a real camera,” Mr. Leibowitz said in an interview last week, “that could easily be done.”
As the adage goes: Everything old is new again.
On the one hand, consumers often benefit from newfangled gizmos — be they cameras, tape recorders or cellphones. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of technology has often left legislators and regulators racing to play catch up.
The F.T.C., for instance, just published a report in which agency experts concluded that data-collection techniques on the Web had outdistanced user privacy control. So it was only natural that Mr. Leibowitz looked to tradition and invoked the 19th-century law review article, which essentially laid the legal foundations for protecting Americans’ privacy rights.
(My colleagues Tanzina Vega, Edward Wyatt and Verne Kopytoff have written in depth this month about the F.T.C. report, its proposed framework for increasing consumers’ privacy choices and its implications for the online marketing industry).
Mr. Warren and Mr. Brandeis wrote, for example, that privacy, an intangible right, was as important as more tangible common law rights, like the ownership of private property. People have the right, they wrote, to control dissemination of their personal thoughts or images. People also have “the right to be let alone.”
In a similar fashion, the F.T.C.’s report recommends that Internet and mobile app users receive better control over who sees, collects and shares information about their electronic behavior — like, say, the Web sites they peruse or the terms they plug into search engines. Indeed, the commission proposed a “do not track” mechanism that would allow consumers to opt out of “behavioral advertising,” the kind of marketing that tailors ads to a consumer’s personal track record.
This is not the first time since snapshot photography that new technology has inspired legal experts to rethink privacy protections.
“The laws haven’t really kept pace with the unbelievable developments,” says Jessica Rich, deputy director of the trade commission’s bureau on consumer protection.
As an example, Ms. Rich cited the 1960s, when deeper credit reporting allowed companies to use advanced database technology to collect consumers’ financial information. Once legislators began to understand how such databases could affect people’s ability to obtain mortgages, housing and even jobs, she said, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The 1970 law allowed consumers to retrieve and correct credit information about themselves.
Indeed, privacy regulation is often reactive, says William McGeveran, a privacy scholar at the University of Minnesota Law School.
Take the Video Privacy Protection Act, enacted by Congress in 1988, after a local newspaper in Washington obtained and published the video rental records of Robert Bork, a Supreme Court nominee. The so-called Bork law, one of the country’s strongest privacy statutes, prohibits the disclosure of personally identifiable rental information without consumer consent.
“One of the comical attributes of privacy regulation is — a lot of it is responsive to fire alarms,” says Professor McGeveran.
Indeed, over time Congress has increased privacy regulation in different industries, he says. There’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, for one, that in 1996 established certain federal protections for personal health information. And the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which required financial service companies to notify customers about their information policies and allow them to opt out from having their data shared with unaffiliated parties.
“Maybe now it’s online privacy’s turn to have more of a direct regulatory intervention,” Professor McGeveran says.
The trade commission’s report proposes new industry practices to enhance online privacy choices for consumers. For those to take effect, however, either the interactive advertising industry would have to increase self-regulation or Congress would have to enact a law enabling the commission to enforce new rules.
Some industry groups are already stepping up transparency.
In October, the Digital Advertising Alliance, a coalition of trade groups, introduced an “advertising option icon”— a logo that Web sites can display to indicate that they collect consumer data and that they allow people to opt out of behavioral advertising. Next month, some data collection firms in that coalition are introducing the Open Data Partnership, a program that will allow consumers to edit their information profiles on certain sites or opt out of being tracked by participating companies.
But Christopher Soghoian, a privacy researcher and graduate student at Indiana University, says most Web sites don’t allow consumers to opt out of tracking.
Companies “promise they won’t use the data they collect for the purpose of picking the individual ads they are showing you,” he says, “but they don’t actually offer to stop collecting data about you.”
AND there’s another potential problem, Mr. Soghoian says.
Web sites often deposit cookies on consumers’ computers to track online preferences and activities. The F.T.C.’s  recommendation for an opt-out mechanism would play on that idea with a privacy cookie, encoded in people’s browsers, that would alert advertising networks to users’ privacy choices.
But a few smaller companies have already moved beyond cookies, Mr. Soghoian says, with a technique called “device fingerprinting.” That advanced technology can follow online behavior — not by using cookies but by tracking signals that are specific to a person’s individual laptop or mobile device.
“That’s not something you can opt out of,” Mr. Soghoian says. “There’s no way to delete my fingerprint because there’s no way for me to delete my phone or my computer.”
Once again, technology forges ahead. Not much has changed since 1890.

The problem is actually two problems: delivering more efficient care to these patients and helping them not to get sick in the first place.
Both tasks require the cooperation of patients and caregivers, as well as the providers of health care and the agencies that pay for it — and, at least as important, a public willing to take proven steps to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The statistics, as reported in December in a strategy report from the Department of Health and Human Services, say it all. More than 25 percent of Americans have two or more chronic conditions — which, by definition, require continuing medical care, and often limit their ability to perform activities of daily living. (The conditions include heart disease, diabetes, obstructive lung disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, asthma, H.I.V., mental illness and dementia, among others.)
As people age, their chances of having two or more chronic conditions rises, and Medicare expenditures rise with them. Two-thirds of Americans over 65 and three-fourths of those over 80 have multiple chronic diseases, and 69 percent of Medicare dollars are spent on people with five or more of them.
And the number of patients is expected to rise sharply in the coming decade as more and more baby boomers enter their late 60s and early 70s. By 2020, the number of people with multiple chronic conditions is expected to increase to 81 million, up from 57 million in 2000.
The new report, “Multiple Chronic Conditions: A Strategic Framework,” was created to provide “a road map for the nation to foster changes in the health care system that can reduce poor health outcomes, improve patients’ quality of life and reduce costs,” said Dr. Anand K. Parekh, an assistant secretary of health who was in charge of the report.
“With an aging population, the persistence of risk factors for disease and the marvels of modern medicine, more people are living with multiple chronic conditions,” Dr. Parekh said in an interview. “New care models are needed to provide coordinated care.”
The Problems
It’s not just the number of conditions people have, nor the number of people who have them. Because of the way medicine is typically practiced these days, people with multiple chronic diseases commonly receive disjointed, often conflicting care. That can lead to preventable hospitalizations and a host of avoidable complications, adverse reactions to treatment, and duplication of expensive, sometimes hazardous tests.
Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help doctors treat patients with many individual chronic conditions, but not for treating common combinations of them. As a result, what is recommended for one disease may counteract what should be done for another.
Dr. A may prescribe something for a heart problem that reacts badly with what Dr. B prescribed for the same patient’s asthma or what Dr. C prescribed for arthritis or osteoporosis.
When no one doctor coordinates and oversees a patient’s total care, or when patients neglect to report all the other prescribed and over-the-counter remedies they take, medical cocktails can become Molotov cocktails.
Often, patients have no idea that a particular treatment is the cause of distressing new symptoms, which can result in an emergency room visit, hospitalization and a raft of costly tests. Even without such emergencies, patients with multiple conditions are often subjected to the same tests by different doctors, contributing further to needless medical expense.
Medications can often be avoided with self-care activities like reducing salt, eating lots of vegetables and fruits and getting regular exercise.
But the doctors’ offices seldom have anyone on staff to help patients develop such routines and stick with them. And medical insurance rarely covers the services of nutritionists and exercise physiologists.
And Some Solutions
Dr. Mary E. Tinetti, a geriatrician at the Yale School of Medicine, says patients with multiple conditions should always be asked what their goals are: to live as long as possible, to be as functional as possible or to be as free of symptoms as possible?
“There’s always a trade-off; you can’t have it all,” Dr. Tinetti said in an interview. “You have to decide what’s most important to you and let the doctors and nurses know your goal. You have to ask, ‘Given all my diseases, what’s the best way to reach my goal?’ ”
When more than one disease is involved, she said, “what may be good for a given disease may not be good for the patient.” The doctor’s job is to choose “a combination of treatments that is most likely to help and not hurt.”
And since “every treatment a patient gets may make something else worse,” Dr. Tinetti said, when a new remedy is prescribed, the patient or caregiver should ask, “What’s this going to do to my other health problems?”
Dr. Parekh stressed the importance of having a single doctor — usually a primary care physician — to serve as “the quarterback of care for individuals with multiple chronic conditions,” the overseer who can coordinate all the patient’s conditions, medications, tests and specialists.
Electronic health records, which store all a patient’s information in one place, are critical to enhancing communication between providers and avoiding adverse drug interactions, said Christine Vogeli, a health policy expert at Massachusetts General Hospital. And after any hospitalization, she said, patients should have “a face-to-face visit” with their primary care doctor, who can reconcile any contradictory treatments and reduce the risk of rehospitalization.
In one medical model being fostered under the new federal health care law, so-called accountable care organizations of family physicians and specialists (and sometimes hospitals) join forces to improve care and reduce costs, with financial rewards for those who meet performance goals.
In another model, several primary care physicians may practice together, assisted by nurse practitioners who periodically check on patients to be sure they follow prescribed remedies and to uncover problems before they become medical crises.
But patients also have a critical role, Dr. Parekh said. They need to learn as much as they can about their conditions; tell the doctor about every medication and test taken, along with behavioral health problems like mental illness and substance abuse; and avoid risk factors like poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol abuse and lack of physical activity.
“The same risk factors that cause a chronic condition can also make it worse,” he said.

The goal is to improve health care and to reduce its long-term expense by moving the doctors and hospitals from ink and paper into the computer age — through a shift to digital patient records.
Step back from the details and what emerges is a huge challenge in innovation design. What role should government have? What is the right mix of top-down and bottom-up efforts? Driving change through the system will involve shifts  in technology, economic incentives and the culture of health care.
“This is a big social project, not just a technical endeavor,” says Dr. David Blumenthal,  the Obama administration’s national coordinator for health information technology.
This year is when the project really takes off. In the 2009 economic recovery package, the administration and Congress allocated billions — the current estimate is $27 billion — in incentives for doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic records.
Now, a new Congress with Republicans looking for budget cuts could take back the money. Legislation has been introduced by Representative Tom Latham, an Iowa Republican, to reclaim unspent stimulus dollars — and money for accelerating the adoption of electronic health records could be a target.
Still, steps to encourage adoption of computerized health records have had bipartisan support over the years, though only the Obama administration has pushed for big financing. Most health policy analysts say it is unlikely that the legislation will be overturned.
When well designed and wisely used, computerized records have proved valuable in improving care. Doctors have more complete information in treating patients, reducing the chances of medical errors and unneeded tests.
But the success stories to date have come mainly from large health care providers, like Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic and a handful of others. Most physicians are in small practices, lacking the financial and technical support the big groups provide for their doctors. So it is scarcely surprising that less than 30 percent of physicians nationwide now use digital records.
Late last year, the administration, working with health professionals and the technology industry, set out a roadmap for what digital records should include and how they should be used, for doctors to qualify for incentive payments, typically up to $44,000. The program begins this year, and the requirements for using the records to report and share health information increase in stages through 2015. After that, penalty payments from Medicare and Medicaid kick in for doctors who don’t meet the use and reporting rules.
The initial requirements to qualify for “meaningful use” are minimal, including being able to collect and electronically report basic information, like vaccinations for children or blood glucose levels for diabetes patients.
The long-range vision is that computerized patient data is a step toward what health care specialists call a “learning health system.” That means data across populations of patients can be analyzed to find what treatments are most effective or to get early warnings on dangerous drug interactions.
“Islands” of such learning networks already exist, notes Charles P. Friedman, chief scientist in the federal health information technology office. By mining its patient data, Kaiser, for example, was first to identify a link between the pain-relief drug Vioxx and a higher risk of heart failure, well before Merck pulled the drug off the market in 2004.
Yet the road to a national computer-enabled learning system, specialists agree, promises to be long. A major obstacle is that so many doctors, especially in small practices, are leery of technology they see as needlessly hard to use and time-consuming. “Doctors don’t want to become clerks,” says Dr. Isaac Kohane, a health technology specialist at the Harvard Medical School.
And complex technology — designed for big health groups, not small practices — could well increase medical mistakes, specialists say.
Such issues, Dr. Blumenthal says, are a reason that the government’s standards, and perhaps even the timetable for adopting electronic health records, will evolve and remain flexible.
The government, he adds, is looking closely at safety and usability. Dr. Blumenthal’s office gave the Institute of Medicine a grant of nearly $1 million for a yearlong study of electronic health records and patient safety. And his office is working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a “usability assessment tool” that can be used to evaluate the digital records offered by different companies.
Under Dr. Blumenthal, the office has tried to gradually build consensus on policy and technical standards rather than issuing edicts. However, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, an independent group of academic and industry experts, said in a report last December that the time had come for more “top-down design choices,” which it called “an appropriate government role” and one that “requires a more aggressive approach than has been taken in the early stages.”
THIS month, the health information technology office announced a step that showed its preferred approach to setting standards, one that borrowed from the Internet model of open-source software development in an initiative called the Direct Project.
Many companies and groups contributed to the government-endorsed Internet-based tools for exchanging health data among institutions. Developers wrote code and suggested ideas, and a consensus built around an approach that was selected by the government. The design was inspired by the Web, with its minimal specifications that leave ample room for innovation, says Dr. Douglas Fridsma, head of standards at the health technology office.
Without a brisk market in information exchange, the campaign to adopt electronic records cannot really pay off. And more is needed than data-sharing standards and privacy and security protections,  Dr. Blumenthal says.
The incentives have to change as well. Two hospitals a few miles apart, he notes, do not now view themselves as allies, but as competitors. To a doctor or a hospital, a patient is, among other things, a financial asset — and holding a patient’s information is valuable.
Insurers, he suggests, will have to pay for providers to share data or penalize them if they don’t. “Information exchange has to be a business goal, rather than a competitive threat, for this to work,” he says.

Thanks to an array of small devices and applications for smartphones that gather vital health information and store it electronically, consumers can take a more active role in managing their own care, often treating chronic illnesses — and preventing acute ones — without the direct aid of a physician.
“Both health care providers and consumers are embracing smartphones as a means to improving health care,” said Ralf-Gordon Jahns, head of research at research2guidance, which follows the mobile industry.
He added that the firm’s findings “indicate that the long-expected mobile revolution in health care is set to happen.”
With a rapidly aging population in some parts of the world and curbs on government spending, the use of computer-compatible devices and online tools as part of a program of preventive medicine is a growing industry.
A report by Parks Associates in February estimated that in the United States alone, revenue from digital health technology and services would exceed $5.7 billion in 2015, compared with $1.7 billion in 2010, fueled by devices that monitor chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes and by wellness and fitness applications and programs.
In January, the French start-up Withings introduced a Wi-Fi-enabled cuff that can take your blood pressure and pulse and that connects to an iPhone to synchronize the data with records kept online. The data can be securely stored on a personal page on the Withings Web site or with other personal health record, or P.H.R., service providers, like Google Health and Microsoft’s HealthVault, where it can then be accessed by your doctor.
In February, Entra Health Systems announced a deal with the Swedish mobile phone company Doro to make its MyGlucoHealth service available on their senior-friendly cellphones. With a small device, blood glucose level readings can be sent by text message to a secure MyGlucoHealth portal, which provides instant advice to users on what to eat. MyGlucoHealth, which the company introduced in 2008, is also compatible with Google Health and HealthVault.
Though MyGlucoHealth is already available around the world using various smartphones and simple mobile phones with Bluetooth, early promotion and partnerships centered on Britain, Australia, Germany, the United States and India. The service is about to be heavily promoted in Asia. John Hendel, chairman of Entra Health Systems, said it would be available in Hong Kong on March 29, in partnership with PCCW, and in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea over the next three months.
“Asia has a very high number of people with mobile phones and with diabetes,” Mr. Hendel said. “It’s a market where there is a lot of genetic predisposition to diabetes, the health care system is typically underfunded and paid for by the patients, and so by coming up with a great cost-effective solution it allows us to capture a big market piece that is just as important as the U.S. market, if not more important.”
A report in November by research2guidance estimated there were more than 17,000 mobile health applications designed for smartphones and that many were aimed at and being adopted by health care professionals. It forecast mobile and wireless health care services would expand significantly  to reach 500 million mobile users, or about 30 percent of an estimated 1.4 billion smartphone subscribers worldwide, by 2015.
Microsoft’s HealthVault and Google Health, introduced in the United States in 2007 and 2008 respectively, offer similar open platforms that allow people to store and manage their health information, including immunizations, disease history and prescriptions in one place, with access to the records possible via various devices or mobile applications.
The personal information is stored in a secure, encrypted database and the privacy controls are set entirely by the individual, including what information goes in and who gets to see it.
“We decided to integrate with Google Health and HeathVault because, based on their potential, a lot of people are using them as a destination site,” Mr. Hendel said. “So instead of having to click on our site and then someone else’s site, they’re acting as depository of connected links.”
HealthVault already integrates 170 health care applications, ranging from one that helps triathletes monitor their training and diet to software for managing diabetes, and the platform works with about 90 medical devices, said Mark Johnston, Microsoft’s international business development lead, from Sydney.
HealthVault’s software development kit has been downloaded 30,000 times. “I think this is the leading indicator of what will come forward,” Mr. Johnston said. “And as we continue to land new contracts and open new markets, our value proposition to our development community is only enhanced because we become the distribution channel and they can go to the market with us.”
While Google Health is at least for now confined to the United States, HealthVault has slowly rolled out its platform internationally, linking with local partners. It was deployed in Canada in 2009 through a partnership with Telus, in Germany though a deal with Siemens and in Britain through a deal with Nuffield Health in 2010.
In October, HealthVault also signed an agreement with a large systems integrator in China, iSoftStone, and the two companies are now focusing on a government program in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province.
“They have a very specific ambition which involves diabetes and hypertension patients, and we’re bringing to market a set of applications and connected devices that are being driven by our partners in China,” Mr. Johnston said. “The entire experience will be localized to their needs to also build a high level of consumer trust.”
He added that HealthVault had been concentrating since the beginning on patients with long-term conditions and chronic diseases. “And we’re trying to go really deep on application pairings with devices to treat those patients because there is a very strong value proposition for those,” Mr. Johnston said, given that governments and other health organizations incur most of their costs from these patients.
So far, adoption of online personal health records by consumers has grown slowly. According to a survey by Knowledge Networks conducted in the United States last year, 10 percent of the public now uses P.H.R.’s, compared with 3 percent in 2008. A similar proportion of doctors said they offered P.H.R. tools to their patients.
Jay Chandran, associate research director of health care at Frost & Sullivan, a research and consulting firm, said he believed patients needed to have an incentive to maintain their online personal health records. Otherwise individuals were unlikely to find the motivation to keep their medical records up to date.
“In my opinion, P.H.R. products will become more successful if data can be captured at the transaction level itself, that is, if a P.H.R. can be a subset of electronic health records, where health care service providers provide the real time information,” Mr. Chandran said. “If the records are maintained and entered by health care service providers, the credibility and utility of such data is higher.”

Re “Carrots, Sticks and Digital Health Records” (Unboxed, Feb. 27), in which Steve Lohr described the promise and the challenges of moving to electronic patient data:
Dr. David Blumenthal, the Obama administration’s national coordinator for health information technology, noted in the column that two hospitals just a few miles apart view themselves as competitors and suggests that insurers will have to pay them to share data or penalize them if they don’t.
But in our competition-based health care system, insurers also view one another as competitors, and unless all provide incentives for the adoption of electronic health records, the fully networked health care system of the future will not be realized.
Federal government investment in health information technology, while a good first step, is insufficient to change hospital and physician behavior. Payment reforms and restructured health care delivery organizations are also needed, and will require a challenging mix of carrots and sticks.
The key ingredient, though, is government leadership. Without it, the United States will continue to lag behind other nations in its ability to provide affordable, high-quality health care.

Big Food. Big Pharma.
To the catalog of corporate “bigs” that worry a lot of us little people, add this: Big Data.
It was not a good week for those who guard their privacy. First, we learned that Apple and Google have been using our smartphones to collect location data. Then Sony acknowledged that its PlayStation network had been hacked — the latest in a string of troubling data breaches.
You’d have to be living off the grid not to realize that just about everything there is to know about you — what you buy, where you go — is worth something to someone. And the more we live online, the more companies learn about us.
But to what extent do others have a right to share and sell that information? That is the crux of a data-mining case that had arguments last Tuesday before the Supreme Court.
The case, Sorrell v. IMS Health, is ostensibly about medical privacy: Vermont passed a law in 2007 that lets each doctor decide whether pharmacies can, for marketing purposes, sell prescription records linking him or her by name to the kinds and amounts of drugs prescribed. State legislators passed the law after the Vermont Medical Society said that such marketing intruded on doctors and could exert too much influence on prescriptions.
But three health information firms, including IMS Health and Verispan, along with a pharmaceutical industry trade group, challenged the law, saying it restricted commercial free speech. Access to prescription records, IMS Health says, helps pharmaceutical companies market efficiently to doctors whose patients would most benefit from specific drugs.
Now the justices are to decide whether the Vermont law is constitutional.
But with the recent headlines about privacy invasion — the PlayStation hack followed a recent breach at the online marketing company Epsilon that exposed e-mail addresses of customers of Citibank, Walgreens, Target and other companies — the Vermont case is tapping into a much broader conversation about consumer protection and informed consent.
The case raises questions about who is collecting, managing, storing, sharing and selling all that data. Just as important, privacy advocates say, it raises questions about whether data brokers are adequately safeguarding it.
People generally don’t have much control over who collects and sells information about them. Moreover, says Christopher Calabrese, a legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, they also don’t even know the names of the data brokers who compile those electronic profiles.
And, so, consumer advocates are setting their sights on Big Data.
“Without government intervention, we may soon find the Internet has been transformed from a library and playground to a fishbowl,” Mr. Calabrese testified in March during a Senate hearing on consumer privacy, “and that we have unwittingly ceded core values of privacy and autonomy.”
There are a few laws, like the Video Privacy Protection Act, that prohibit businesses from releasing personally identifiable records, like video rental histories, without customer consent. The Digital Advertising Alliance, a coalition of online marketing groups, introduced a program last year that notifies consumers about online tracking and allows them to opt out of advertising tailored to them.
The Vermont law amounts to a kind of do-not-call option for doctors who may welcome visits from pharmaceutical sales reps but don’t want drug marketing based on their own prescription records.
That marketing practice is possible because pharmacies, which are required by law to collect detailed information about prescriptions they fill, can sell doctor-specific prescription records to data brokers. (According to federal privacy regulations, personal information about patients, like names and addresses, must be removed before the records can be sold for marketing.) Firms like IMS Health then combine the records, and pharmaceutical reps often use them to tailor presentations to individual doctors.
The central concern is privacy — of both doctors and their patients. While pharmacies remove the names of patients before selling the records, those names are replaced with unique codes that track patients over time from doctor to doctor, according to the Vermont complaint. That means data firms could create a profile that includes a person’s prescriptions as well as the names of the pharmacies and dates at which the person picked up the medications, says Latanya Sweeney, a visiting professor of computer science at Harvard.
“It ends up building a detailed prescription profile of individuals,” says Professor Sweeney, whose research on data re-identification was cited by several briefs in the case. “Those extended profiles tend to be very unique.”
The concern, she says, particularly in a small state like Vermont, is that a nameless prescription record could theoretically be enough to identify someone who might not want others to know that he takes, say, anti-depressants. Moreover, Professor Sweeney argues, data miners could collate those files with public information, like voter registration and hospital discharge records, to link prescriptions to specific people.
Federal health privacy regulation, she says, does not protect patient records once they have been de-identified. Nor does the law prohibit re-identification.
But IMS Health says it isn’t aware of any case of re-identifying patients whose prescription records were de-identified in accordance with federal rules. The company says it doubly encrypts each patient’s identity and gives the encryption keys to several third parties — meaning that no single entity can decode a file by itself, says Kimberly Gray, chief privacy officer at IMS Health.
The company typically sells combined reports that show how many patients received a certain drug from a certain doctor, but not the specific drugstores those patients frequent, Ms. Gray says. IMS never uses public information or outside data sets to try to re-identify patients, she says, and when it does provide encoded patient histories to others for research purposes, it prohibits those third parties from making such attempts.
“We would never want to re-identify someone,” Ms. Gray says. “No good can come from that.”
Still, it is hard to prevent people from trying to re-identify patients, says Lee Tien, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties group that filed a brief in support of Vermont. It would be easier, he says, if Congress passed a law that went further than Vermont’s, giving people the right to consent before their encrypted prescription records were sold for marketing purposes.
“In Vermont, the doctor can decide,” Mr. Tien says. “But we’d prefer it if the patient were able to say, ‘Don’t sell my data.’ ”

But now the two departments have agreed to develop a joint computerized system for health care records that could provide a single source of data on a veteran’s health from enlistment through death, officials from the departments said.
The move is one of several that suggest the two departments are moving closer to unifying parts of their sprawling health care systems, which handle more than 15 million active-duty troops, retirees, veterans and their families.
The agreement also comes in the wake of a February report by the Government Accountability Office that found the two departments were lagging in developing a shared system for electronic records.
That report said that both departments had spent billions upgrading their data systems in ways that did not improve coordination between their separate systems, and it recommended that they improve their “joint strategic planning.”
In a meeting on May 2, Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary, and Eric Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs, agreed to move ahead with developing the joint system, which had long been discussed but was the subject of some doubt until now, federal officials said.
Veterans say that under the current system, they sometimes have to carry paper copies of their health records from their military service to their new doctors at veterans hospitals. Some also complain that records transferred electronically get lost because the two computer systems are not always compatible.
“In future, that data will be completely interoperable,” Elizabeth A. McGrath, the deputy chief management officer for the Defense Department, said in an interview. “We are approaching the delivery of care in a standard way.”
Ms. McGrath said a shared system should speed care for veterans, since they will not have to obtain records from the Defense Department that might be missing in their Veterans Affairs Department record.
She also said it could make it easier for researchers and epidemiologists to spot health care trends, since data collected in one system can be more easily searched. Moreover, many health care problems facing veterans do not emerge until years after they leave military service, so being able to look at their entire medical history could be useful to researchers.
Officials in the Obama administration also hope that the joint system will save money, though they declined to estimate how much. “It will create efficiencies,” Ms. McGrath said.
Given the size of the undertaking, officials said it would take several years to complete. But a joint system is already under development in Chicago, where the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs share a medical center, the Capt. James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center.
Peter Gaytan, executive director of the American Legion in Washington, said that a joint health care system would reduce the time it takes for veterans to transition into the V.A. health system. Jim Strickland, a veterans advocate, said the lack of shared system meant that many doctors in the veterans health care system did not know details about the medical histories of veterans they treated, such as medications prescribed in Iraq or Afghanistan.
“That the V.A. physicians don’t have any access at all to the previous years of treatment records and notes by other doctors and caregivers is an absurd situation,” Mr. Strickland said. “The flow or continuum of good care is suddenly interrupted.”
Officials in both departments said they hoped to speed delivery of the new system, and reduce the cost, by requesting bids that involve commercially available software. They also said they are willing to allow different departments within their health care systems to develop distinct programs, provided they can all be accessed through a single system.
In a series of meetings this spring, Mr. Gates and Mr. Shinseki also discussed significantly speeding up the time it takes for people leaving the military to get exams that will determine their disability compensation.
In the past, people with injuries linked to their military service were examined by a military doctor and given a rating that would determine their disability benefits. Then they would receive another exam from a doctor in the veterans system — and often those two ratings were different. Beyond that, the armed services also used different criteria from one another in rating injured troops.
The two departments have begun standardizing their systems so that the Army uses the same criteria as the Navy and Air Force — and that all use the same system as the Department of Veterans Affairs.
That standardized evaluation system will be in place for the entire country by the end of the year, officials said. But it has not always speeded up the process, as some people must still wait 300 days or more for exams.
Mr. Gates and Mr. Shinseki have agreed they wanted to look for ways to shorten the process to as little as 75 days, a memorandum they signed said.

It’s a government Web page that lists nearly 300 hospitals, doctors and insurance companies that have reported significant breaches of medical privacy in the last couple of years.
Such lapses, frightening to consumers, could impede the Obama administration’s effort to shift the nation to electronic health care records.
“People need to be assured that their health records are secure and private,” Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, said in an interview by phone. “I feel equally strongly that conversion to electronic health records may be one of the most transformative issues in the delivery of health care, lowering medical errors, reducing costs and helping to improve the quality of outcomes.”
So the administration is making new efforts to enforce existing rules about medical privacy and security. But some health care experts wonder if the current rules are enough or whether stronger laws are needed, for example making it a crime for someone to use information obtained improperly.
“The consequences of breaches matter,” conceded Dr. Farzad Mostashari, a former New York public hospitals official who recently became the Obama administration’s national coordinator for health information technology. “People say they are afraid that if their private information becomes known, they may not be able to get health insurance.”
In the last two years, personal medical records of at least 7.8 million people have been improperly exposed, according to the government data. One particularly egregious case involved information about 1.7 million patients, staff members, contractors and suppliers of Bronx hospitals and clinics operated by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the New York public health agency. Their electronic files were stolen from an unlocked van belonging to a record management company.
The affected patients got the disquieting news that their medical and personal information, like Social Security numbers, had been violated when their health care providers notified them under federal rules.
Showing just how lax security can be, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services said two weeks ago that the agency had found dozens of vulnerabilities in systems to protect records of patients at seven large hospitals in New York, California, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia and Missouri. Auditors cited such problems as personal information that was not encrypted and was stored on computers that could be easily used by unauthorized users.
Auditing teams are now inspecting eight more hospitals, said Lori Pilcher, an assistant inspector general at Health and Human Services. The hospitals are not being identified to avoid alerting hackers, she said.
Another big breach was reported in March on the official Web site by Health Net, a California-based insurance company, which notified 1.9 million health plan members that records with their personal information were missing.
Health Net said I.B.M., which was managing its information system, told the insurer that the records could not be found.
“The health care industry is not as vigilant as they should be about protecting private information in a patient’s medical records,” said Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican who is co-chairman of the Bipartisan Privacy Caucus in the House.
Mr. Barton knows from personal experience. His own records after a heart attack, along with several thousand others from a research project at the National Institutes of Health, were “on a disk in a laptop in somebody’s trunk that disappeared,” he recalled. “I was stunned.”
The Obama administration has levied a string of stringent penalties for egregious violations of patient rights under the most commonly cited law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, of 1996. Health information is supposed to stay private under those rules, but research has shown that it is not that difficult to connect names and addresses to nominally anonymous data with Internet searches and computerized matchups.
The Office of Civil Rights at Health and Human Services, which took over enforcement of the law, imposed a $1 million fine on Massachusetts General Hospital in March after a hospital employee left paper records of 192 patients on a Boston subway train. The hospital agreed in a settlement, without admitting wrongdoing, to report twice a year on its efforts to tighten patient protections.
Earlier this year, the civil rights office fined a Maryland health plan, Cignet Health, $4.3 million, saying that it had denied patients the right to see their own records in violation of HIPAA provisions. It was the first civil penalty levied under the HIPAA law. “We have ramped up our enforcement,” said Georgina C. Verdugo, director of the civil rights office.
But Dr. David Brailer, a Bush appointee as the first national coordinator of health information technology, is skeptical about whether such efforts will curb security breaches. “We can’t just lock health care data away — because of its role in lifesaving treatment,” Dr. Brailer said.
He said that even with the best technology it would be hard to make health systems secure. “It’s a huge challenge. Break-ins and hacks are unfortunately going to be part of the landscape,” he said.
One protection, he suggested, would be laws to make it illegal for an insurer or employer to discriminate against a person based on information about health conditions like H.I.V./AIDS, cancer and mental health problems.
As a model, he pointed to the antidiscrimination law to prevent the misuse of genetic information that was passed with bipartisan support in the Bush administration. He also said he believed the laws should say “patients own the data, period, and decide what happens to it. The patient should be able to say to Hospital X: ‘send my data to Hospital Y because I’m changing hospitals,’ “ he said.
Today, the information belongs to whoever possesses it, under ideas inherited from 17th-century English common law, he said. “If it gets into your database, essentially you own it,” he added, “and you can pass it on.”
“Today HIPAA makes no sense,” Dr. Brailer added. “The law didn’t anticipate a world where your data passes through many, many hands.”
Wes Rishel, a longtime health care analyst for Gartner, the technology consulting firm, and an adviser to the national coordinator’s office, has a similar view. “Your ability to control access to your information is a horse that is already out of the stable,” he said. “What is really needed is legislation that controls use of it.”
On that score, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have shown that at least 30 people and organizations have access to the health data of a typical person with private insurance through an employer. They range from pharmacies and drug companies to an employer’s wellness programs and a spouse’s self-insured employer.
“Only you, your doctor and hundreds of others know,” said Latanya Sweeney, a health privacy expert at Harvard and Carnegie Mellon who is also an adviser to the office headed by Dr. Mostashari.
Since HIPAA was enacted there has been “an explosion in data sharing,” Ms. Sweeney said. “And after electronic records are widely adopted, there will be another big explosion.”

When Google Health was introduced in 2008, Marissa Mayer, a Google executive, said it would be a “large ongoing initiative” that the company hoped would attract millions of regular users.
But Google Health never really caught on. In a posting on the company’s blog on Friday, Aaron Brown, senior product manager for Google Health, wrote that the goal was to “translate our successful consumer-centered approach from other domains to health care and have a real impact on the day-to-day health experiences of millions of our users.”
Yet, after three years, Mr. Brown said, “Google Health is not having the broad impact we had hoped it would.”
In the drive to apply information technology to health care, personalized health records are the element that relies most heavily on individual motivation and efforts. They are controlled by the consumer, and require individuals to put in, update and edit their health data. By contrast, the federal government has begun a five-year campaign to accelerate the adoption of electronic patient records by hospitals and doctors, with the incentive payments to physicians topping $40,000.
Personal health records, analysts say, are a new concept to most people, and early users have found them difficult to use. “Personal health records have been a technology in search of a market,” said Lynne A. Dunbrack, an analyst at IDC Health Insights, a research firm.
In a survey earlier this year, IDC Health Insights found that 7 percent of consumers had tried online personal health records, and fewer than half of those continued to use them.
Google is by no means the only company to abandon the field of consumer health records. Revolution Health, for example, retired its personal health record service last year, citing few users.
Suppliers of online personal health records include WebMD, Microsoft, RelayHealth and Dossia. But analysts note that what success these offerings have had has often been in partnership with insurers and health providers, while Dossia is an employer-sponsored personal health record.
Adam Bosworth, a former manager of Google Health, who left in 2007 before the service was introduced, said the service could not overcome the obstacle of requiring people to laboriously put in their own data.
“In the end,” Mr. Bosworth said, “it was an experiment that did not have a compelling consumer proposition.”
The consumer technologies that catch on, he said, inform or entertain users, or enable social communication. Mr. Bosworth said he learned that in his own health information technology company, Keas. The business started in 2009, but switched its approach last November to focus on social games to encourage participation in wellness programs.
Technology companies have often underestimated the complexity of the health field, assuming that fresh ideas and new digital tools will bring quick results, said Dr. David J. Brailer, the national coordinator for health information technology in the Bush administration.
When that does not happen, they pull back, Dr. Brailer said. The Google experience, he said, fit that pattern, and the company had been pulling resources from Google Health for some time.
“For a long while, everybody knew that Google Health was dead, except Google,” said Dr. Brailer, who is the chief executive of Health Evolution Partners, an investment fund.
Google is also shutting down its PowerMeter service, which let consumers track their energy use.

150,548,2011-08-16T00:00:00Z,article,Losing Privacy in Route Plans,5411656938f0d80f29522741,"subject:Airlines and Airplanes, subject:Privacy, organizations:Federal Aviation Administration",Business,0.0,None,The government has curtailed a program that allowed airplane owners to opt out of having their flight plans and en route data made publicly available.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/business/flight-policy-change-stirs-privacy-outcry.html,1097,The government has curtailed a program that allowed airplane owners to opt out of having their flight plans and en route data made publicly available.,"Imagine that every car had a global positioning device and that before every trip, drivers were required to let the traffic authorities know where they were going. And suppose the government released all that data to the public so anyone could follow a car’s movements online simply by entering a license plate number.
Aircraft owners face an analogous situation. This month, the Federal Aviation Administration curtailed the little-known Block Aircraft Registration Request, or BARR, program, which allowed airplane owners to opt out of having their flight plans and en route data made publicly available, particularly to Web sites that offer free, real-time tracking.
Henceforth, the agency said, only aircraft owners who could provide “written certification of a valid security threat” would be able to block public release of their data.
“It’s totally nonsensical,” said Ed Bolen, president and chief executive of the National Business Aviation Association, which along with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the American Civil Liberties Union oppose the F.A.A.’s action. “Just because the government collects data doesn’t mean it has to release it. What about income tax records and health information? They don’t release that.”
In announcing the F.A.A.’s planned change in policy, the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in May that the action was in keeping with the Obama administration’s commitment to transparency in government. “Both general aviation and commercial aircraft use the public airspace and air traffic control facilities, and the public has a right to information about their activities,” he said.
Within airspace regulated by the F.A.A., large commercial aircraft as well as many general aviation airplanes have to operate under Instrument Flight Rules. These rules require filing a flight plan, which gives the plane’s registration number (its tail number), the departure location, destination and anticipated time en route. The plane is also required to have a transponder, an electronic device that communicates with ground radar to record location, speed and altitude.
So the F.A.A. is the repository of a wealth of flight data. And since 1997, the agency has made this information available free to Web sites like FlightAware.com and FlightView.com, which allow users to track flights if they know the plane’s tail number.
But privacy concerns prompted the F.A.A. in 2000 to collaborate with the National Business Aviation Administration to create the BARR program, which blocked the release of flight data if the owner requested it. About 7,400 of the 357,000 registered airplanes were blocked before the program was curtailed this month.
Now, only 970 aircraft meet the more stringent standard, which requires applicants to establish a valid security concern. The agency defines that as “a verifiable threat to person, property or company, including a threat of death, kidnapping or serious bodily harm against an individual, a recent history of violent terrorist activity in the geographic area in which the transportation is provided, or a threat against a company.”
Among the aircraft dropped from the blocked list is the Cessna Citation CJ3 owned by Boyd Bros. Transportation, based in Clayton, Ala. The company uses the jet to visit far-flung truck terminals as well as its customers. The company’s aviation manager, Eddie Yell, said executives had good reason to want to obscure where and when they fly.
“We’ve had cases of disgruntled truckers, so you don’t want to make yourself a target,” he said. “And we also do surprise inspections of our facilities that weren’t a surprise when our flight information was online. The employees would actually meet us at the airport.”
Moreover, he said, competitors could track the plane’s progress to learn targets of potential mergers and acquisitions.
John Hayes, 58, a retired optical engineer from Bend, Ore., who flies a Cessna Citation Mustang jet, was also upset that he could no longer participate in the BARR program. “I had this kooky guy posting on aviation Web forums that he was flying with me on actual trips I had taken and that I let him take the controls,” he said. “It creeped me out so I blocked my tail number.”
But other airplane owners said they did not understand the fuss. David Pomerance, 67, chief operating officer of Premier Aircraft Sales in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., flies a Mooney single-engine piston aircraft three to four times a week for business and pleasure. “I like that family, friends and customers can go online and know where I am and what time I’m arriving,” he said. “The only way it’d be a problem is if you’re running around on your wife or you want to hide personal use of business aircraft.”
That’s not how the A.C.L.U. sees it. “We believe the default should always be that your location remains private,” said Chris Calabrese, the A.C.L.U.’s privacy lobbyist.
Spurred by privacy advocates and outraged aviators, lawmakers have sent letters to Mr. LaHood expressing concerns about restricting the BARR program. And Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Leonard Boswell of Iowa, both pilots, have amended the long-stalled House F.A.A. reauthorization bill to allow any aircraft owner who asks to participate in the BARR program.
The National Business Aviation Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association also jointly filed a petition in June asking the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to overturn the F.A.A.’s decision to restrict access to the BARR program. This followed an unsuccessful attempt to get the court to suspend any changes to the program pending litigation or legislative action.
Marc Warren, acting chief counsel for the F.A.A., said case law was on the agency’s side. He cited a 2008 ruling by the District Court for the District of Columbia that allowed the release of a year’s worth of blocked aircraft data to the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica after it filed a Freedom of Information Act request. “That ruling made us cast a critical eye at the rationale for blocking tail numbers,” he said.
But Mr. Bolen at the National Business Aviation Association said that the ProPublica case was a singular event and that the court “was clear that its decision was in no way related to the real-time or near real-time release of data nor called for a change in the BARR program.”
A private pilot himself, Mr. Bolen added that he would not block the release of his flight information if he owned a plane. Still, he said, “I support the right of Americans to opt out of having their private movements broadcast on the Internet whether they are in an airplane, or a car, or just using a cellphone that receives a signal from the federal government’s G.P.S. system.”

When doctors go into private practice, they learn about profits and losses on the job, in a complex industry that is subject to large-scale forces beyond the control of most individuals.
“Overhead continues to go up, but your ability to raise prices is very limited,” said Dr. J. Fred Ralston Jr., past president of the American College of Physicians and an internist with Fayetteville Medical Associates, a group practice in Tennessee that recently marked its 100th anniversary. “Never in that time — which included the 1918 flu epidemic, two world wars and at least one depression — have we been as challenged as we are now in the changing world of health care.”
Given fixed Medicare payments and nonnegotiable managed care contracts, it is difficult to move the dial on revenue. So physicians looking to maintain profits often turn to controlling costs. Based on interviews with business-minded doctors, a medical practice can become a cost-efficient machine if managers control human resource expenses, spread out fixed costs as much as possible, exploit information technology and carefully track business metrics.
LIMIT STAFF COSTS “Personnel is clearly the biggest place you can save,” said Dr. Jack Flyer, a physician with CardioCare in Chevy Chase, Md. In two years, the practice of 10 cardiologists cut its support staff in half, to 20 workers, by cross-training employees and working more efficiently. At the same time, patient encounters, or visits, actually climbed 20 percent.
“The days of having multiple medical assistants help you with every task is over. I do almost everything myself,” said Dr. Flyer, who prescribes and takes notes electronically and greets his waiting patients before personally escorting them to an examination room.
When the practice’s echocardiographers or nuclear technologists are done with their technical duties, they phone patients with reminders or to set up appointments. This also pays off when a staff member calls in sick or takes vacation. “We don’t have to hire a temp to be a medical assistant or secretary,” he said. “We can just take one of our billers or medical records people and slide them into a different position. Everyone in the office has a list of things to do if they’re not busy doing their primary job.”
Some medical practices rely heavily on part-time personnel to avoid paying benefits. But Dr. Ralston advised against getting too cheap with loyal employees whose expertise enables doctors to do their jobs. “We have low office turnover,” he said, “and we really feel that is helpful in running an office efficiently.”
SPREAD OUT FIXED EXPENSES Another quick fix for bloated budgets is to stretch your fixed costs across more physicians or expanded office hours. Practices with multiple doctors enjoy efficiencies that solo practitioners cannot obtain, as well as greater power in negotiating discounts with insurance companies, paper suppliers, vaccine makers and even credit card processors.
At Hopewell Dental Care outside Columbus, Ohio, for instance, the four partners see patients most evenings until 7 p.m. and on Saturdays, to spread the cost of office space over as much time as possible. “We make the most out of our physical building,” said Dr. Steve Krendl. “Compared with the single practitioner who’s only able to use his building clinically 36 hours a week, we’re using it 60 hours.”
The practice recently bought equipment to mill crowns while patients wait, which cut costs to about $45 for materials, not including staff time; the nonmaterials cost to mill a crown off site had been $190. The $150,000 price tag for the equipment is affordable because it is spread over four dentists.
“Once that equipment is paid for, that’s a pretty dramatic financial benefit for us and the patient as well, if they don’t have to come back a second time,” Dr. Krendl said.
Big is better for Shady Grove Fertility, one of the largest fertility practices in the United States, with 13 locations around the Washington-Baltimore area, more than 400 employees and 24 physicians. “The administration is more centralized, and you’re spreading it over a larger base,” said Mark Segal, the practice’s chief executive. “You’re able to get volume purchasing discounts on supplies. That makes it very difficult for a small, one- or two-physician practice to compete. We’re seeing more and more practices consolidating.”
GO ELECTRONIC The 2009 federal stimulus package included incentives of up to $44,000 for each physician for adopting electronic medical records. Moreover, effective information technology systems can save physicians valuable hours in prescribing, note-taking and communicating with staff or patients.
“My time is used far more efficiently than it was in the past,” said Dr. Thomas F. Long, senior partner at the San Ramon Valley Primary Care Medical Group in California. Electronic prescribing eliminates phone calls to pharmacists or patients. “With that work-flow improvement, it gives me time for an extra patient or two in the day.”
Electronic records also make it feasible to win pay-for-performance bonuses from insurance companies. For instance, when all of the San Ramon Valley practice’s diabetic patients with Blue Cross insurance complete a recommended blood test, the group gets a financial bonus. The practice needs software to track the eligible patient population and document that the benchmark has been met.
MONITOR AND TWEAK AS NEEDED Given the rapidly changing landscape in medicine, it is important to keep tabs on your business metrics and adjust your procedures if necessary.
Shady Grove Fertility holds monthly business meetings to track retention, yield and other metrics against past performance and industry benchmarks, on top of an annual planning retreat. New physicians are trained through a seminar on the practice’s procedures, including emphasis on first appointments to establish trust and lay the groundwork for a long-term relationship with patients. “The more hand-holding you do, the more retention you get,” Mr. Segal said. “Eighty percent of physicians out there don’t understand that concept.”
Two years ago, the credit crisis caused an enormous drop-off in patients as people were unable to tap credit cards or equity lines to pay the $13,500 to $25,000 cost of infertility treatment. Shady Grove worked with an outside company to secure financing for some patients. The practice also offers a program to let patients share eggs from a single donor, cutting the cost by as much as $6,000.
Hopewell Dental relies on a consultant for information about industry benchmarks and trends, like a decline in company-provided dental insurance. The practice monitors its patient population to ensure that everyone comes in for regular appointments as soon as they are due.
No matter how effectively they cut costs, physicians in all specialties face uncertainty over the future of group insurance and Medicare, given the continuing debate in Washington. “It’s hard to do a traditional practice analysis,” Dr. Ralston said. “Having a good relationship with the patients and doing the right thing for them gives you an opportunity to weather what’s a difficult storm currently.”

The information stayed online for nearly a year.
Since discovering the breach last month, the hospital has been investigating how a detailed spreadsheet made its way from one of its vendors, a billing contractor identified as Multi-Specialty Collection Services, to a Web site called Student of Fortune, which allows students to solicit paid assistance with their schoolwork.
Gary Migdol, a spokesman for Stanford Hospital and Clinics, said the spreadsheet first appeared on the site on Sept. 9, 2010, as an attachment to a question about how to convert the data into a bar graph.
Although medical security breaches are not uncommon, the Stanford breach was notable for the length of time that the data remained publicly available without detection.
Even as government regulators strengthen oversight by requiring public reporting of breaches and imposing heavy fines, experts on medical security said the Stanford breach spotlighted the persistent vulnerability posed by legions of outside contractors that gain access to private data.
The spreadsheet included names, diagnosis codes, account numbers, admission and discharge dates, and billing charges for patients seen at Stanford Hospital’s emergency room during a six-month period in 2009, Mr. Migdol said. It did not include Social Security numbers, birth dates, credit-card numbers or other information used to perpetrate identity theft, he said, but the hospital is offering free identity protection services to affected patients.
The breach was discovered by a patient and reported to the hospital on Aug. 22, according to a letter written four days later to affected patients by Diane Meyer, Stanford Hospital’s chief privacy officer. The hospital took “aggressive steps,” and the Web site removed the post the next day, Ms. Meyer wrote. It also notified state and federal agencies, Mr. Migdol said.
“It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public,” he said. “It is our intent 100 percent of the time to keep this information confidential and private, and we work hard every day to ensure that.”
Diane Dobson, of Santa Clara, Calif., said her “jaw dropped” on Saturday when she intercepted the letter from Ms. Meyer addressed to her 21-year-old son, who she said had received emergency psychiatric treatment at Stanford in 2009. Ms. Dobson said it could have been disastrous if her son, who lives at home, had learned that his name was linked to a mental health diagnosis.
“My son, I can tell you, is fragile and confused enough that this would have sent him over the edge,” Ms. Dobson said, saying she decided to speak publicly now because of her frustration with the breach. “Everyone with an electronic medical record is at risk, and that means everyone.”
Records compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services reveal that personal medical data for more than 11 million people have been improperly exposed during the past two years alone.
Since passage of the federal stimulus package, which includes provisions requiring prompt public reporting of breaches, the government has received notice of 306 cases from September 2009 to June 2011 that affected at least 500 people apiece. A recent report to Congress tallied 30,000 smaller breaches from September 2009 to December 2010, affecting more than 72,000 people.
The major breaches — a disconcerting log of stolen laptops, hacked networks, unencrypted records, misdirected mailings, missing files and wayward e-mails — took place in 44 states.
One occurred at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford in January 2010, when a desktop computer holding the medical records of 532 patients was stolen from the heart center by an employee. Hospital officials said at the time that no patient information was compromised.
But the California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $250,000, the maximum allowed, for failing to report the breach within five days of discovery, as is required under state law. The hospital appealed the fine, and a settlement has been reached but not yet disclosed, a department spokesman said.
The Stanford episode reinforces the fear that even the most prestigious medical centers are not immune to risk.
 Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which trains Harvard medical students, agreed this year to pay a $1 million federal fine after an employee left paper medical records on a subway while commuting to work. The pages included the names of 192 patients, and diagnoses for about a third of them, including diagnoses for H.I.V./AIDS. They were never recovered.
The Department of Health and Human Services viewed the breach as a potential violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the 1996 law that requires protection of medical records.
Mr. Migdol, the hospital spokesman, said Stanford had concluded that “there is no employee from Stanford Hospital who has done anything impermissible.” He said he expected the federal Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own investigation. Susan McAndrew, a deputy director in the department’s Office for Civil Rights, said she could not discuss whether an investigation was in progress.
The vendor, identified by Mr. Migdol as Multi-Specialty Collection Services L.L.C., based in Los Angeles, is described on its Web site as a subsidiary of Texican Inc. Joe Anthony Reyna, who is listed in state and commercial records as Texican’s principal, did not respond to messages left at his office and home.
Mr. Migdol said the company created the spreadsheet as part of a billing-and-payment analysis for the hospital. He said the hospital immediately suspended its relationship with the contractor and received written certification that previous files would be destroyed or returned securely.
Tina Warner, a vice president at Chegg, an online company that bought Student of Fortune in August, said the site’s principals were unaware the data had been posted until informed by the hospital. They then “took it down within 30 seconds,” she said. Ms. Warner said the identity of the person who posted the Stanford data could not be determined from the user name.
Bryan Cline, a vice president with the Health Information Trust Alliance, a nonprofit company that establishes privacy guidelines for health providers, said nearly 20 percent of breaches involved outside contractors, accounting for more than half of all the records exposed.
Dr. Cline said health care providers depend unjustifiably on legal contracts with vendors to protect medical records. “That just doesn’t work, as we can see,” he said. “You have to do due diligence, something to assure yourself that the people you’re giving your data to can be trusted.”

Now, through a book he wrote with Mary Adam Thomas, “The Web-Savvy Patient,” he is trying to help others facing a medical crisis use the Internet to their advantage and avoid its potential pitfalls.
In 1996, at age 45, with two young children and hoping for a third, Mr. Schorr had his life turned upside down by a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an incurable disease. Cancer doctors in Seattle, near his home in Mercer Island, Wash., told him he needed immediate chemotherapy.
But before he took their advice, he went on the Web and found a community of patients with his disease. The name of a specialist in Houston, Dr. Michael J. Keating, appeared repeatedly in their messages to him.
Soon, he and his wife, Esther, were on a plane to Houston. Dr. Keating told them that Mr. Schorr would be around for a long time and that they should go ahead and have the third child they wanted. The doctor also said no treatment was needed until and unless Mr. Schorr’s condition began to progress, which it did four years later.
For six months in 2000, Mr. Schorr was treated with a combination of standard chemotherapy for leukemia and an experimental medicine, a monoclonal antibody called rituximab (Rituxan), which has kept him alive and well to this day. That third child, Eitan, is now a 14-year-old high school football player.
“Had I taken the original advice I got in Seattle, I never would have been eligible for Dr. Keating’s treatment,” Mr. Schorr told me. “And we probably would not have had Eitan.” His two older children, Ari, 21, and Ruth, 18, are now in college.
“Many doctors warn patients that they have to be careful of health information on the Web,” Mr. Schorr wrote in his book. “That is true. But patient-to-patient connections online have helped me, and they can help you, too. So can online connections with medical experts and medical information. You just need a helping hand from a savvy guide to help you navigate the Web.”
It is just such a no-nonsense guide that he and Ms. Thomas have provided. In it, they discuss the kinds of useful information that can be gleaned online, at no cost, by anyone with a serious medical condition, and they describe the hallmarks of bogus advice and commercially sponsored information that may or may not be helpful.
After his diagnosis, for example, Mr. Schorr began by going to the Web site www.ACOR.org (for the Association of Cancer Online Resources), where he found a community of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a blood cancer that can remain quiescent for years, then suddenly progress.
“First, I lurked. I watched the players,” Mr. Schorr said in an interview. “Then I began asking questions about treatment and looked for responses. Several people gave the same responses, suggesting that I contact Dr. Keating.” Mr. Schorr learned that the doctor is one of the world’s leading experts in his disease.
Online Patient Communities
In their book, the authors warned that in searching for reliable information, Web users have to be discerning and think like consumers, not patients, to avoid scams and commercially motivated advice. “The Internet’s greatest strength is also its greatest flaw: Anybody can post just about anything on the Web,” they wrote.
“You need to screen out ‘I did this and you should too’ kinds of advice,” Mr. Schorr said. “Medicine is changing too fast. The Internet can help you know which way the wind is blowing: what’s new, who are the experts, where to go.”
The authors also warned against claims that someone has lifesaving information that the medical establishment “doesn’t want you to know about.”
A good place to start would be patient advocacy groups affiliated with national nonprofit health associations, like the American Heart Association or the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Online patient communities exist for virtually every major illness and quite a few that are relatively obscure. For people concerned about privacy, real names do not have to be used when posting messages.
In addition to finding the best available therapy, online patient communities can help people with problems associated with various health conditions and their treatments — for example, “chemo brain,” the mental fogginess and memory problems that can result from chemotherapy.
“The doctors don’t talk about this, but people with it do,” Mr. Schorr said, and those people can help others understand what’s happening and how best to cope with the problem.
“What you get online can help you can frame issues that you want to talk to your doctor about,” he said.
Establish an Electronic Record
When dealing with a serious or chronic illness, it can be very challenging to keep track of every test, treatment, dosage and complication, as well as the contact information for every health professional concerned with your care. One of the most valuable pieces of advice in Mr. Schorr’s book is to establish an electronic personal health record.
Among its advantages: having a permanent record of everything that was done to date and its consequences; giving different doctors instant access to vital information about your condition; avoiding needless repetition of costly, hazardous or inconvenient tests; maintaining contact information for all members of your health care team; and having a centralized source of everything important about your health.
The information recorded can include lab test results and diagnostic images; a list of emergency contacts; your health insurance information; a medication log of drug names, dosages, dispensing pharmacies and dates, and your immunization records; links to useful online patient communities and reliable medical information; personal entries about your reactions to tests and treatments; copies of your living will; and contact information for your chosen health care agents.
Nor do you have to be sick to establish such a record. Christy Schulz, 43, a wife and the mother of two school-age children in Hudson, Wis., was struggling to keep track of the family’s medical records through three major moves in 10 years. Through a record-keeping system offered online by the Mayo Clinic (powered by Microsoft HealthVault), Ms. Schulz was able to store all the relevant health information for each member of her family.
“It’s all about peace of mind, knowing there’s only one place I have to go and I can get at it from any computer,” Ms. Schulz told the authors. The information proved especially useful when her daughter Avery’s early-in-life struggle with asthma recurred some time later. Ms. Schulz decided to show Avery, 13, how to log on to the site and take an active role in her own health.

Kelsey-Seybold in Houston is the galleria of health clinics: it has storefronts for every imaginable specialty; online, same-day, no-referral-necessary appointment scheduling; an on-site pharmacy; and even free valet parking.
As the United States grapples with rising health care costs and a system that rewards doctors and hospitals for how sick their patients get, not how healthy they become, Texas health care providers are increasingly experimenting with new payment and care delivery models — joining forces to emphasize efficiency and outcomes.
These new models present a culture shift for the state’s physicians. But they have provided an intriguing benefit for patients, drawn to the convenience and comfort of a system financially motivated to keep them as well as possible.
“Doctors in Texas traditionally haven’t wanted to share resources, to share financial risk, to share clinical information,” said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. “But there are pioneering groups here that are putting an emphasis on quality and cost efficiency. They’re innovative nationally, and they’re moving the ball.”
The nation faces an undeniable crisis in health spending. By 2020, the country’s health expenditures are expected to reach $4.6 trillion a year, almost 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Roughly half of this spending comes in government programs, a potentially catastrophic hit to state and federal budgets.
Health care experts say the leading contributor to escalating costs is the dominant fee-for-service payment system, in which doctors and hospitals are paid per treatment or procedure and make more when patients get infections or complications. But they fear returning to the health maintenance organization model that limited patient choice and gave doctors a financial incentive to ration care.
The solution, health care providers including Village Health Partners and Kelsey-Seybold believe, is clinical integration — in which groups of family physicians and specialists share electronic patient information, the costs of case management and care coordination, and the latest research on best practices, all with the symbiotic goal of keeping costs low and patients well.
Texas is not blazing a brand-new trail. Nationally, health systems like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania and Intermountain Healthcare in Utah have long taken this value-over-volume approach. Scott & White Healthcare, with its 12 system hospitals and more than 60 clinics, has led the integrated-care charge in Central Texas.
But with the rollout of the federal health overhaul, and new Texas legislation tended to pay for performance, not procedures, more Texas providers may join the movement. Last month, the United States Department of Health and Human Services started a pilot program to pay primary care practices a monthly fee if they provide better chronic-care management, give patients 24-hour access to care and health information, and collaborate with specialists to better coordinate care.
The Kelsey-Seybold clinic has been a gold standard for the multispecialty group practice since it opened in 1949. Today it employs 373 physicians across 55 specialties in 20 different facilities — all of them with in-house labs and X-rays, and wired for the same electronic medical record. Its flagship clinic, which opened in 1999, looks like a gleaming shopping mall, with storefronts for a multitude of services, from pediatrics to women’s health to day surgery. But its most innovative approach may be KelseyCare, a four-year-old so-called accountable-care plan offered through Cigna in which patients, via their employers, have all their health care for a single year provided at a fixed, customized rate.
“The real focus ought to be on how much it costs to care for a group of patients over a period of time and achieve desirable outcomes,” said Dr. Spencer R. Berthelsen, Kelsey-Seybold’s chairman and managing director. “There’s way too much attention on unit cost — what is the cost of an office visit or a laboratory test or a day in the hospital.”
To make KelseyCare work outside the fee-for-service model, the clinic relies heavily on electronic medical records to prevent duplication in tests run or treatments provided. It has automated best-practice alerts, to make sure patients get regular immunizations or mammograms that could prevent costly ailments down the line. And it has made it convenient for its patients — including three-quarters of the City of Houston’s employees — to get the preventative care they need to stay well, from offering same-day online appointments to housing specialists mere feet from their primary care partners.
At Village Health Partners, the anchor tenant for the 100,000-square-foot Legacy Medical Village in Plano, the payment model has not shifted from fee-for-service yet. The various physician practices at Legacy remain independent, and their doctors self-employed. But Dr. Christopher Crow, the founder of Village Health, has a similar idea: attract patients by making care accessible, convenient and high quality, and reinvest the profits into measuring what works.
As a family medicine physician fresh out of medical school, Dr. Crow watched, frustrated, as his patients waited days for lab results and weeks to get in to see specialists, while their health suffered. “It was like going to McDonald’s and being told to come back in four days,” Dr. Crow said. “I wanted to build a place where everything was built around access and convenience.”
So he did, opening Legacy Medical Village, a sprawling health complex that four years later is now home to 14 primary care physicians and 30 different services and specialty practices that provide comprehensive treatment, from oncology and bariatric surgery to physical therapy.
Legacy Medical Village has a wide range of tenants: a workers’ compensation program, behavioral and weight loss therapy, a sleep study center and a headache department. It runs research trials and has an in-house dentist.
But care is centered on the family medicine linchpin, Village Health Partners, which coordinates the care of its 45,000 patients with electronic records technology, case managers, around-the-clock e-mail responses and a guarantee that phones will be answered within 60 seconds.
Dr. Crow said the model could be reproduced virtually anywhere, once Texas doctors get past their fierce independent streak.
“Anywhere there’s a population of patients who need health care, these synergies can be stuck together,” he said. “The individual models foster zero coordination of care. The physician-led organization is the solution.”

The report by the Institute of Medicine comes as the government is spending billions of dollars in incentive payments to encourage doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records. The Department of Health and Human Services requested the study, in response to concerns from some doctors and public health experts that the drive for digital records might bring a wave of technology-induced medical errors.
The goal of moving from paper to computerized patient records is to improve patient care and curb health care costs. The federal report does not assert that the effort to move to electronic health records is misguided, but that safety considerations must be a crucial ingredient.
The proposed investigative agency, the report said, should be modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board, which examines airline safety and accidents. The Institute of Medicine committee also called for tracking the safety performance of electronic health records in use. Results from studies done so far, the report said, are mixed. Success stories are offset by reports of patients harmed.
The advisory group recommended that electronic health record suppliers drop “hold harmless” clauses from their sales contracts. Such language often limits the freedom of doctors and hospitals to publicly raise questions about software errors or defects.
The report was an attempt to balance interests by acknowledging the safety risks and calling for more accountability, without hindering innovation or slowing the adoption of electronic health records, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and a member of the panel.
“There are real safety issues, but we believe that on average, health information technology improves patient safety,” Dr. Jha said.
Ross Koppel, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania who is also on the faculty of its medical school, praised the report for putting safety into the national discussion of electronic health records. That is a shift, he said, from the view that “assumes as an article of faith that health information technology is better than paper.”
But Dr. Koppel, who reviewed the study before it was published, said the report evaded the issue of regulation by not calling on the Food and Drug Administration to be responsible for the safety of electronic health records.

WHY can’t Americans tap into the ingenuity that put men on the moon, created the Internet and sequenced the human genome to revitalize our economy?
I’m convinced we can. We are in the early phases of the next big technology-driven revolution, which I call “consumer health.” When fully unleashed, it could radically cut health care costs and become a huge global growth market.
Over the past few years, innovations like electronic health records and the use of mobile computing devices in hospitals have begun to improve medical care delivery. Consumer health information Web sites and online disease support groups have made millions of people active participants in their own health care.
But imagine a far more extreme transformation, in which advances in information technology, biology and engineering allow us to move much of health care out of hospitals, clinics and doctors’ offices, and into our everyday lives.
Here’s a picture — inspired by ideas and innovations emerging from university research labs, clinical innovation centers, start-ups and large companies — of how it could work.
It would begin with a “digital nervous system”: inconspicuous wireless sensors worn on your body and placed in your home would continuously monitor your vital signs and track the daily activities that affect your health, counting the number of steps you take and the quantity and quality of food you eat. Wristbands would measure your levels of arousal, attention and anxiety. Bandages would monitor cuts for infection. Your bathroom mirror would calculate your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen level.
Then you’d get automated advice. Software that could analyze and visually represent this data would enable you to truly understand the impact of your behavior on your health and suggest changes to help prevent illness — by far the most effective way to cut health care costs.
Many situations would still call for professional medical attention, of course, but in most cases you wouldn’t need to make a costly trip to the doctor’s office. If you were not feeling well, a lifelike avatar on your smart phone would use natural-language processing to listen as you described your symptoms and then would translate them into medical jargon. After consulting a diagnostic supercomputer, the avatar would ask you to run a few quick medical tests at home.
You might slip a low-cost plastic attachment over your phone display, look into its eyepiece and conduct a cataract exam. The avatar would transmit the results to your human doctor, who would send you a video message explaining the diagnosis and prescribing treatment.
When you did need an office visit, you and your doctor would sit side by side in front of a large touch screen that would display a conceptual animation of what was going on inside your body. Decisions like choice of medication and dosing schedules would be made collaboratively with your doctor, and treatment regimens would be synchronized to apps on your phone that would make the task of following doctor’s orders — all too often neglected — easy and even fun. (I am an adviser to some early stage start-ups developing technologies like these.)
The United States should commit to a “moon shot” for consumer health to make this imagined world a reality. In addition to the health benefits, we would gain revenue from exports of consumer health products to countries like China and India, which are likely to become enormous health care markets. And the savings in health care costs could easily amount to a trillion dollars annually, as those costs are now about 18 percent of gross domestic product but could be brought closer in line with the 10 percent typical of modern developed nations.
I acknowledge that this goal is very optimistic, given the paternalism of the medical profession, the poor health habits of most Americans and the perverse incentives of our health care system.
But the burgeoning consumer health revolution has a powerful force on its side — American creativity. There is a rapidly growing network of inventors, academics and entrepreneurs who share a passion for empowering individuals to take control of their health. There is even a spirited health data movement, known as the Quantified Self, that is reminiscent of the Homebrew Computer Club, whose members helped spawn Apple and other companies in the early days of the personal computing revolution.
There’s also private sector money beginning to flow. Venture capitalists are ramping up their investments in health-tech start-ups. The X Prize Foundation is co-sponsoring a $10 million award for the best mobile device allowing consumers to diagnose their own diseases.
For its part, all the government has to do is to catalyze this revolution. One step in the right direction is Healthdata.gov, a free resource of public health data and tools that can help innovators quickly bring to market data-driven applications and services. A bigger step would be for Congress to pass a bill that would orchestrate the development of interoperability and privacy standards for consumer health products and actively promote the industry at home and abroad.
Recent history has shown that when the right cultural, technical and economic forces converge, people can transform fundamental aspects of society from the bottom up in a way that seemed impossible just a short time before. I believe that such a time is coming for health care.

The official, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, listed five reasons for what he described as the “extremely high level of waste.” They are overtreatment of patients, the failure to coordinate care, the administrative complexity of the health care system, burdensome rules and fraud.
“Much is done that does not help patients at all,” Dr. Berwick said, “and many physicians know it.”
In an interview on Thursday, his last day on the job, Dr. Berwick reflected on his successes, failures and frustrations in trying to engineer a rapid transformation of the health care system while beating back criticism from Republicans in Congress.
President Obama nominated Dr. Berwick to be the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in April 2010. While the Senate was investigating his qualifications, Mr. Obama circumvented Congress by giving Dr. Berwick a temporary recess appointment, a shortcut that infuriated Republicans and irked some Democrats. The appointment was due to expire at the end of this year.
Dr. Berwick said he had not sought the job. Indeed, he said, “I did not even know if I was fit for it.” He took the post, he said, because he sensed that “tectonic shifts” were occurring in the health care delivery system.
“I came with an agenda,” Dr. Berwick said. “I wanted to try to change the agency to be a force for improvement, covering one out of three Americans.”
Asked why Americans were still deeply divided over the new health care law, signed 20 months ago, Dr. Berwick said: “It’s a complex, complicated law. To explain it takes a while. To understand it takes an investment that I’m not sure the man or woman in the street wants to make or ought to make.”
But, Dr. Berwick said, just as Americans supported manned missions to the moon without knowing the details of rocket science, they ought to support the new law because of its ultimate destination.
“We are a nation headed for justice, for fairness and justice in access to care,” Dr. Berwick said. “We are a nation headed for much more healing and much safer care. There is a moon shot here. But somehow we have not put together that story in a way that’s compelling.”
Dr. Berwick, a soft-spoken pediatrician, received his own Medicare card in September when he turned 65. As Medicare chief, he has pushed doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records, merge their operations and coordinate care to eliminate medical errors that kill thousands of patients each year.
If his estimate is right, Medicare and Medicaid could save $150 billion to $250 billion a year by eliminating waste, which he defines as “activities that don’t have any value.”
Dr. Berwick sounded like a professor of political science or a visitor from a foreign country when he recounted his efforts to fathom Washington’s ways.
“Government is more complex than I had realized,” he said in an understatement. “Government decisions result from the interactions of many internal stakeholders — different agencies and parts of government that, in many cases, have their own world views.”
Before coming here, Dr. Berwick was president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group in Cambridge, Mass., that trains medical professionals. “I was used to moving very, very fast,” he said. “We could decide on Monday to start a program and have it in existence on Wednesday.”
As a federal official, Dr. Berwick was sometimes impatient with colleagues in the government and with the health care industry. “I wish they could go faster,” he said. But, he added, “I don’t think you want government to be impulsive.”
During his tenure, Dr. Berwick testified at only two public hearings, and he said he “loved them” both, even though Republicans tried to skewer him.
He said some members of Congress had “deep knowledge” of health care — he mentioned two Democratic senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.
Dr. Berwick often found himself in an awkward position.
Republicans called him evasive. For political reasons, the administration did not want him to defend past statements in which he had extolled the virtues of the British health care system and had suggested a need to cap total health spending and limit the supply of costly high-technology medical care in the United States.
Dr. Berwick said most of the criticism by Republicans, who warn of a government takeover of health care, was “purely political, a world of sound bites.” In the interview, he lashed out at Republicans who depict him as an advocate of rationing health care.
In 2009, he told a biotechnology journal, “The decision is not whether or not we will ration care — the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.”
Dr. Berwick said Republicans had “completed distorted” his meaning. “My point,” he said, “is that someone, like your health insurance company, is going to limit what you can get. That’s the way it’s set up. The government, unlike many private health insurance plans, is working in the daylight. That’s a strength.”

He was 48 and had been a quadriplegic since he was shot during a robbery in the hardware store he owned. I called an ambulance and admitted him to the hospital, where we soon brought his urinary tract infection under control. But he developed a bedsore, which became infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacterium that breeds in hospitals. He didn’t survive the hospitalization.
This was in 1998. Ever since, I have struggled to treat my patients in their homes and avoid hospitals except when absolutely necessary. I practice general internal medicine on Roosevelt Island in New York City’s East River, where many of my patients are elderly and homebound: survivors of the polio epidemic, people with multiple sclerosis, paraplegics, some on respirators.
Patients who are treated at home by a doctor and nursing staff who know them intimately and can be available 24/7 are happier and healthier. This kind of care decreases the infections, mistakes and delirium, which, especially among the elderly, are the attendants of hospital care. And it is far more efficient. According to a 2002 study, for the patients treated by the Veterans Affairs’ Home Based Primary Care program, the number of days spent in hospitals and nursing homes was cut by 62 percent and 88 percent, respectively, and total health care costs dropped 24 percent.
I had one 83-year-old patient whose arthritis kept her from moving around, but she loved to talk about her career as a rocket scientist — working on weather rockets, not military ones. One day, a well-intentioned neighbor dropped by and called 911 after finding her feverish and dehydrated from diarrhea.
My patient had never been treated before at the hospital she was taken to, and as a Russian immigrant, had no family here for the hospital to contact. She became disoriented; the hospital assumed she was demented and transferred her to a nursing home. It took me two months to track her down and many more to get her home, where, among well-known attendants and friends, she became lucid again. If she had lived out her days in an institution, she would have cost Medicare a great deal of money, and her life would have been shorter and far less happy.
All too often, ambulances take people to the nearest hospital, not to the one where their doctor is on staff. State laws make it difficult to administer simple treatments in the home. Emergency rooms want to admit patients, and hospitals want to discharge them to nursing homes, rather than send them home.
The good news is that last year’s health care reform act included provisions for the creation of Independence at Home Organizations — groups of doctors and nurses who treat patients in their homes — and incentives to make that work appealing. The organizations can invest in extra services and home visits (for which Medicare typically will not reimburse them) because they will share in a cut of the savings that result from avoiding hospital visits and expensive procedures. The program is to go into effect no later than Jan. 1.
However, Medicare is behind schedule and has not yet issued the rules or applications to begin the process. It has been focusing instead on another provision of the new law intended to deliver more efficient care, creating accountable care organizations — groups of hospitals, doctors and nurses who work together to treat patients. But Medicare should make getting the Independence at Home Organizations up and running a priority.
We have the technology. Electronic medical records can give a doctor with an iPad as much information as any institution. With hand-held machines and a few drops of blood, doctors can get test results in seconds at a patient’s bedside. Portable X-ray and ultrasound equipment can be wheeled into homes. Monitors can alert doctors to any change in a patient’s heart rate.
The fact that this care is possible at home means that the role of hospitals must change. Acutely ill patients who need operating rooms or intensive care will still be brought to hospitals. But they should be quickly discharged to the care of the doctors and nurses who know them best.
For too long the institutions that make up our health care system — hospitals, insurers and drug companies — have told us that “more is better”: more medicines, more specialists, more tests. To rein in spending and deliver better care, we must recognize that the primary mission of many an institution is its own survival and growth. We can’t rely on institutions to shrink themselves. We need to give that job to patients and their doctors, and move health care into the home, where it is safer and more effective.

“It should be stopped,” he said.
But at the same time, Mr. Gingrich was cheering a $19 billion part of the package that promoted the use of electronic health records, something that benefited clients of his consulting business. “I am delighted that President Obama has picked this as a key part of the stimulus package,” he told health care executives in a January 2009 conference call.
After the bill was passed a month later, Mr. Gingrich’s consultancy, the Center for Health Transformation, joined two of its clients, Allscripts and Microsoft, in an “Electronic Health Records Stimulus Tour” that traveled the country, encouraging doctors and hospitals to buy their products with the billions in new federal subsidies. “Get Engaged, Get Incentives,” one promotion read.
As Mr. Gingrich runs for president, he is working to appeal to Republican primary voters suspicious of big-government activism, especially in the realm of health care. But interviews and a review of records show how active Mr. Gingrich has been in promoting a series of recent programs that have given the government a bigger hand in the delivery of health care, and at the same time benefited his clients.
During the Bush administration, he was a leading Republican advocate for the costly expansion of Medicare, which many in his party now regret. And he and his center pushed some policies that are reflected in Mr. Obama’s health care record — a record Mr. Gingrich regularly criticizes on the campaign trail. All the while, his center functioned as a sort of high-priced club where companies joined him in working the corridors of power in Washington and in state capitals.
Mr. Gingrich did not respond to questions for this article. But a spokeswoman for the center said in an e-mail that Mr. Gingrich was a health care “visionary” who, for instance, supported electronic health records “BEFORE it ever came up for discussion by the president or anyone else.”
Mr. Gingrich’s chief Republican rival, Mitt Romney, has found himself on the defensive among conservatives for signing a universal health care law when he was governor of Massachusetts. But Mr. Gingrich has his own history with health care policy, part of which puts him at odds with many Republican voters.
Mr. Gingrich’s ideas and the interests of his clients are often intertwined. When President George W. Bush and some Congressional Republicans were seeking to block renewal of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 2007, Mr. Gingrich met with his former conservative House colleagues, arguing that inaction could unfairly harm children. At the time his center was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by major drug makers and insurers, groups that would have been harmed by a lapse in the program.
When he urged Republicans to support the Bush administration’s expansion of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit, he worked to ensure that it would cover new diabetes treatments sold by Novo Nordisk, a Danish drug company and a founding member of Mr. Gingrich’s center.
More broadly, he has indicated his agreement with the most controversial aspect of President Obama’s heath care plan, the requirement that every American buy health insurance. Although he now says he is opposed to the so-called individual mandate, in a May 2009 conference call — previously unreported — he told health care executives, “We believe there should be must-carry; that is, everybody should have health insurance, or if you’re an absolute libertarian, we would allow you to post a bond.”
Mr. Gingrich also worked with former Senator Tom Daschle, an early health policy adviser to Mr. Obama, to write a forward to the center’s book on the expansion of electronic health records. “It’s fair to say he was supportive of the goals of health care reform,” Mr. Daschle wrote in a brief e-mail exchange. “And I felt that we were in agreement on some of the principles.”
Mr. Gingrich has defended his support for the prescription drug benefit, and other health care spending, by saying that present costs will be more than offset by future savings. And a spokeswoman for his company, the Center for Health Transformation, Susan Meyers, reiterated Mr. Gingrich’s assertion that he does not lobby. But his dealings with Novo Nordisk show how his center’s policy advocacy could blend with the narrower objectives of its paying members.
Separate from its $200,000-a-year charter membership in the center, Novo Nordisk, the world’s largest producer of insulin, hired Mr. Gingrich to help “position itself as a thought leader” in an initiative to raise awareness of diabetes. A research document prepared in 2003 by the Gingrich Group, a consulting firm related to the health care center, noted that in improving treatment, the company wished to also emphasize insulin-delivery devices that “offer better financial return for Novo.”
Mr. Gingrich’s health center went on to help Novo Nordisk create a national diabetes campaign, and worked to shape government policies toward the disease. According to a presentation by a Gingrich aide to health care executives in 2004, the center was “working to insure” that Medicare covered insulin products manufactured by Novo Nordisk, and Mr. Gingrich planned to meet with members of Congress “to help them develop priorities” on fighting diabetes.
In its annual report to shareholders, Novo Nordisk listed its work with Mr. Gingrich under the category of public-policy activities, noting: “Such activities are often referred to as lobbying.”
But a Novo Nordisk spokesman, Ken Inchausti, said Mr. Gingrich actually did no lobbying for the firm.
“He was providing us with guidance and strategic advice on how best we could inform policy makers,” Mr. Inchausti said, adding that Mr. Gingrich had valuable insights because of his work on diabetes while in Congress.
The devices were ultimately covered. Dr. Mark McClellan, President Bush’s administrator of Medicare and Medicaid Services at the time, said that he did not remember Mr. Gingrich specifically bringing up diabetes issues, but that he had various interactions with Mr. Gingrich.
“A lot of people including Newt had some views and some clients who cared about the issues that we were dealing with,” he said. “I do remember having a lot of discussions about what should and shouldn’t be covered.”
Mr. Gingrich also worked with Dr. McClellan and other Bush administration health officials on electronic records.
“Newt and I had many conversations,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, the Bush administration’s national health technology coordinator. “Because of Newt’s involvement, you dealt with a significant amount of creativity — they had a lot of creative ideas of how it could work and how it should work.”
Over the years, Mr. Gingrich accumulated more and more clients with an interest in building a national electronic health records system: Allscripts, Siemens, Microsoft and GE Healthcare.
Certainly, his belief in the importance of electronic health records fit with his futurist bent. Huge advances in technology, the argument goes, can enable doctors from different hospitals, different fields and even in different states to work off a single electronic file that would include every medical decision and diagnosis in a given patient’s history. Mr. Gingrich was among leaders of both parties who argued that the technology would save lives and billions of dollars while also providing a huge database of results to judge the efficacy of treatments.
Mr. Gingrich found common cause with Hillary Rodham Clinton, then a senator from New York; Mr. Daschle, with whom he wrote the introduction to the center’s book, “Paper Kills 2.0”; and Senator Sheldon D. Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island.
Shortly before Mr. Obama’s election in 2008, Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Gingrich wrote an opinion article in The Washington Times calling for a national, electronic health information system. They also called for the creation of a “comparative effectiveness institute” that could use the network to “collect and understand the best practices of the country’s best providers of care.” Such an institute, they wrote, “could not only educate other providers on how to improve, but also inform policy makers on how to design policy that promotes these best practices.”
When President Obama proposed spending tens of billions on developing just such a system, Mr. Gingrich wrote in The New York Post in mid-January 2009, “The president-elect should be applauded for making this vital priority a key part of his economic stimulus plan.”
Mr. Gingrich’s chief health aide, David Merritt, was invited to testify before a Senate panel on privacy issues related to the creation of the system. During that testimony, Mr. Merritt told the senators, among them Mr. Whitehouse, that while protecting privacy was important, “I think that as we move forward with comparative effectiveness and evidence-based medicine, we need as much data as possible.”
When the bill passed, providing more than $19 billion in incentives and grants to help health care providers buy electronic systems, the center and its health technology clients were in a celebratory mood. In presentations to investors, the Allscripts chief executive, Glen Tullman, called it “the most expansive opportunity in our company’s history,” and “more money coming into a segment than we’ve ever seen.”
In order for Allscripts and other health care systems makers to benefit from incentives and grants, they would need to make sure potential customers knew they were eligible for the cash. And so, joining with industry partners — including another center client, Microsoft — it embarked on an “E.H.R. Stimulus Tour,” visiting cities and providing Webcasts.
In one of the Webcasts, Mr. Merritt joined with Mr. Tullman and the Allscripts marketing chief to walk through the stimulus bill incentives.
When The Wall Street Journal editorial board, in January 2009, criticized the bill for creating a Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, the center was there to defend it. The Journal argued that eventually “the comparative effectiveness outfit will start to ration care to control costs.” In a statement for the center, Mr. Merritt had said that while those fears were understandable, “that argument is not currently justifiable in the specific language of the bill.”
The following August, however, the coordinating council came in for added scrutiny as conservative health care opponents rallied against its creation in angry town-hall-style meetings and online, playing into fears of “death panels.”
Around the same time, Mr. Gingrich reversed his call for a “comparative effectiveness institute.”
“In our country, the road to dehumanizing, bureaucratic health care rationing,” Mr. Gingrich wrote in Human Events, a conservative publication, that August, “begins with something called comparative effectiveness research.”

THE push to move the nation from paper to electronic health records is serious business. That’s why a first look at the campus of Epic Systems comes as something of a jolt.
A treehouse for meetings? A two-story spiral slide just for fun? What’s that big statue of the Cat in the Hat doing here?
Don’t let these elements of whimsy fool you. Operating on 800 acres of former farmland near Madison, Wis., Epic Systems supplies electronic records for large health care providers like the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, as well as health plans like Kaiser Permanente and medical groups like the Weill Cornell Physicians Organization in New York. In fact, Epic’s reputation as a fun-filled, creative place to work helps draw programmers who might otherwise take jobs at Google, Microsoft or Facebook.
Epic supplies software, systems, training and support so its customers can manage their data. As far as the general public is concerned, it operates far under the radar. Yet it helps keep track of 40 million patients, alongside a handful of large software companies and hundreds of smaller firms that have emerged to digitize health records.
Unlike some of those firms, Epic is no newcomer. Judith Faulkner, the chief executive, started the company more than 30 years ago, when, in all but a very few places, patient records were kept on paper. As such, she has a long-term view of the nation’s struggle to digitize medical records.
Ms. Faulkner understands why it’s taken much longer for the health care industry than, say, banks and airlines to move to electronic data. In banking, the types of data are much more limited and known, she says. In health care, by contrast, data is constantly changing based on information from doctors, nurses, patients and others. New discoveries, protocols and government requirements add even more complexity.
The way this data is stored and used can literally be a matter of life and death — which is why the transition to electronic health records is so sensitive. And why it’s so important, Ms. Faulkner says. Computerized record systems can actively search for and analyze information in ways that paper files never can, thereby improving patients’ health, she says.
Digital records are an invaluable tool for doing research and improving care, says Philip Fasano, executive vice president and chief information officer of Kaiser Permanente. “For example, we are able to follow decades of data on diabetes patients,” he says. “We can see which medicines are absolutely the best and personalize the doses. We can truly change the medical outcomes.”
Ms. Faulkner started digitizing patient records when she was just out of graduate school in computer science at the University of Wisconsin. That’s when a research group in the psychiatry department asked her to create a system to help keep track of patient data over time.
Her program, built on ideas from a few other pioneers, was a success. Other medical researchers began requesting their own versions, and eventually a business was born.
At first, Epic consisted of three part-time employees working at $10 used desks in the basement of an apartment house near the university. They bought a bulky computer from a company called Data General; it had two 50-megabyte disk drives that sounded like a noisy washing machine, Ms. Faulkner recalls. “You couldn’t touch it, or the data got messed up,” she says.
There may have been a learning curve, but “to the best of our knowledge, in the 32 years we’ve been in business, there has never been a breach of Epic’s data by a hacker,” Ms. Faulkner says — speaking to a concern that has some people nervous about the conversion to electronic health records.
Concerns about security are hardly groundless. A government Web site known as the “Wall of Shame” has documented hundreds of breaches that threatened patients’ privacy.
At Epic, “We have all sorts of firewalls and security systems in effect to prevent data breaches,” Ms. Faulkner says. On laptops used by doctors, files can be viewed but not stored. The same is true for smartphones and tablets. “We do not store patient data on them,” she says, so it cannot be misused if these devices are stolen.
Ms. Faulkner is an industry representative on a government panel charged with examining privacy and security issues regarding health data. She says she wants to strike a balance between ensuring privacy and making sure that information can be shared for better patient care.
“I’m worried if we put up too many barriers in order to make things private, and if that makes the flow of information slow and hard to share, in effect more people will be harmed,” she says. So far the committee has maintained that balance well, she says.
Carl Dvorak, an executive vice president at Epic, says the company shares patient data with health care organizations that are not customers if they meet certain conditions. They need “appropriate patient consent,” he says. “To ensure privacy and security each health care organization uses a digital certificate to prove their identity to other health care organizations when exchanging patient records.”
Another concern among patients and medical professionals is the possibility of medical errors resulting from improperly used or poorly designed record systems. Federal officials are exploring options for reporting and dealing with such problems. The industry prefers reporting voluntarily to a patient safety organization linked to the Department of Health and Human Services and its health information technology agency.
EPIC has had to consider these types of issues while growing very quickly. A decade ago, it was still a relatively small company, with 575 employees. Then, in 2003, Kaiser Permanente, based in California, chose Epic over two much larger companies — I.B.M. and Cerner — to provide the electronic system for its 36 hospitals and more than eight million members.
Kaiser estimates it will eventually spend a total of $4 billion on the software and related costs like those for equipment and training employees.
Epic has been adding other large customers, for a total of 260, including 35 new contracts last year. All told, it says, its systems will cover 127 million patients with active electronic health records by July 2013. It now has 5,100 employees; to handle all that growth, it plans to hire 1,000 more people this year.
Its customers include many hospitals that are connected to medical schools, as well as large physician groups. The Epic software system is a “de facto standard among the more complex academic health centers and multispecialty medical groups,” says Dr. John D. Halamka, chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a professor at the Harvard Medical School.
As a privately held, employee-owned company, Epic does not issue profit statements. Its revenue for 2011 is expected to come in at nearly $1.2 billion, a 45 percent increase over the previous year, the company says.
The federal government is contributing to the recent growth of Epic and similar firms by offering financial incentives to health providers who switch to electronic records. It sees these records as a way to improve patient care and reduce inappropriate costs like those for duplicated tests.
Nearly 40 percent of American primary care doctors and about 25 percent of hospitals use electronic patient records. Thousands more are expected to adopt them this year to qualify for financial help under the 2009 federal stimulus package.
The government began to disburse the money last May; so far, hospitals and doctors have received $2.5 billion of a potential $27 billion in stimulus funds, federal officials said last week.
In addition to Epic, other suppliers of health data systems include Allscripts, Meditech, Cerner and units of diversified giants like I.B.M., McKesson, Siemens and GE Healthcare. All of those companies’ varying systems have raised concerns about usability, especially when different systems must share information. Some wonder if the government should play a bigger role in creating uniform technical standards and designs across systems.
“So far the advisory committees that I am on have been wise in figuring out the right balance between what should be left to the vendors as they listen to their customers and what should be prescribed by the government,” Ms. Faulkner says.
About 250,000 doctors use Epic’s system, and “they give us a lot of feedback on design,” she says. “I haven’t seen an expert group that does better. Typically the wisdom of the crowd is better than direction from a small group.”
EPIC’S employees include doctors and nurses who visit customers’ sites to see what is and isn’t working. Last September, some 6,600 health care and information technology executives  and professionals also visited the company’s bucolic campus here for a users’ conference.
The giant slide — one of the many quirky features of the campus — was a popular diversion during the conference.
“I never would have expected to see a bunch of executives going down a slide,” says Aaron Webb, 28, a software developer from St. Cloud, Minn., who has worked at Epic for six years.
Ms. Faulkner has made it a point to offer a “cool” workplace even though her company is distant from Pacific beaches or Manhattan towers. As part of an Epic committee, she has bought some of its eye-catching artwork at community art fairs around Wisconsin.
“It is an incredible physical facility,” says Marjorie Klein, a retired professor of psychiatry, original investor and longtime Epic board member. “I think it supports employee creativity.”
The campus also has 15 acres of solar electric panels, thousands of geothermal wells for heating, and crops that are harvested for biomass fuel.
Epic broke ground for the Verona campus in 2002 and began moving its main operations there from Madison in 2004.  With the Kaiser contract in 2003 and the new business that followed, Epic has been expanding its acreage and adding buildings ever since. It now has 13 buildings and underground parking garages with 3.5 million square feet of space; a million more square feet is under construction.
That includes a sleek 5,000-square-foot data center — a far cry from the single computer in that basement in Madison that rattled like a washing machine three decades ago.

Ms. Faulkner understands why it’s taken much longer for the health care industry than, say, banks and airlines to move to electronic data. In banking, the types of data are much more limited and known, she says. In health care, by contrast, data is constantly changing based on information from doctors, nurses, patients and others. New discoveries, protocols and government requirements add even more complexity.
The way this data is stored and used can literally be a matter of life and death — which is why the transition to electronic health records is so sensitive. And why it’s so important, Ms. Faulkner says. Computerized record systems can actively search for and analyze information in ways that paper files never can, thereby improving patients’ health, she says.
Digital records are an invaluable tool for doing research and improving care, says Philip Fasano, executive vice president and chief information officer of Kaiser Permanente. “For example, we are able to follow decades of data on diabetes patients,” he says. “We can see which medicines are absolutely the best and personalize the doses. We can truly change the medical outcomes.”
Ms. Faulkner started digitizing patient records when she was just out of graduate school in computer science at the University of Wisconsin. That’s when a research group in the psychiatry department asked her to create a system to help keep track of patient data over time.
Her program, built on ideas from a few other pioneers, was a success. Other medical researchers began requesting their own versions, and eventually a business was born.
At first, Epic consisted of three part-time employees working at $10 used desks in the basement of an apartment house near the university. They bought a bulky computer from a company called Data General; it had two 50-megabyte disk drives that sounded like a noisy washing machine, Ms. Faulkner recalls. “You couldn’t touch it, or the data got messed up,” she says.
There may have been a learning curve, but “to the best of our knowledge, in the 32 years we’ve been in business, there has never been a breach of Epic’s data by a hacker,” Ms. Faulkner says — speaking to a concern that has some people nervous about the conversion to electronic health records.
Concerns about security are hardly groundless. A government Web site known as the “Wall of Shame” has documented hundreds of breaches that threatened patients’ privacy.
At Epic, “We have all sorts of firewalls and security systems in effect to prevent data breaches,” Ms. Faulkner says. On laptops used by doctors, files can be viewed but not stored. The same is true for smartphones and tablets. “We do not store patient data on them,” she says, so it cannot be misused if these devices are stolen.
Ms. Faulkner is an industry representative on a government panel charged with examining privacy and security issues regarding health data. She says she wants to strike a balance between ensuring privacy and making sure that information can be shared for better patient care.
“I’m worried if we put up too many barriers in order to make things private, and if that makes the flow of information slow and hard to share, in effect more people will be harmed,” she says. So far the committee has maintained that balance well, she says.
Carl Dvorak, an executive vice president at Epic, says the company shares patient data with health care organizations that are not customers if they meet certain conditions. They need “appropriate patient consent,” he says. “To ensure privacy and security each health care organization uses a digital certificate to prove their identity to other health care organizations when exchanging patient records.”
Another concern among patients and medical professionals is the possibility of medical errors resulting from improperly used or poorly designed record systems. Federal officials are exploring options for reporting and dealing with such problems. The industry prefers reporting voluntarily to a patient safety organization linked to the Department of Health and Human Services and its health information technology agency.
EPIC has had to consider these types of issues while growing very quickly. A decade ago, it was still a relatively small company, with 575 employees. Then, in 2003, Kaiser Permanente, based in California, chose Epic over two much larger companies — I.B.M. and Cerner — to provide the electronic system for its 36 hospitals and more than eight million members.
Kaiser estimates it will eventually spend a total of $4 billion on the software and related costs like those for equipment and training employees.
Epic has been adding other large customers, for a total of 260, including 35 new contracts last year. All told, it says, its systems will cover 127 million patients with active electronic health records by July 2013. It now has 5,100 employees; to handle all that growth, it plans to hire 1,000 more people this year.
Its customers include many hospitals that are connected to medical schools, as well as large physician groups. The Epic software system is a “de facto standard among the more complex academic health centers and multispecialty medical groups,” says Dr. John D. Halamka, chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a professor at the Harvard Medical School.
As a privately held, employee-owned company, Epic does not issue profit statements. Its revenue for 2011 is expected to come in at nearly $1.2 billion, a 45 percent increase over the previous year, the company says.
The federal government is contributing to the recent growth of Epic and similar firms by offering financial incentives to health providers who switch to electronic records. It sees these records as a way to improve patient care and reduce inappropriate costs like those for duplicated tests.
Nearly 40 percent of American primary care doctors and about 25 percent of hospitals use electronic patient records. Thousands more are expected to adopt them this year to qualify for financial help under the 2009 federal stimulus package.
The government began to disburse the money last May; so far, hospitals and doctors have received $2.5 billion of a potential $27 billion in stimulus funds, federal officials said last week.
In addition to Epic, other suppliers of health data systems include Allscripts, Meditech, Cerner and units of diversified giants like I.B.M., McKesson, Siemens and GE Healthcare. All of those companies’ varying systems have raised concerns about usability, especially when different systems must share information. Some wonder if the government should play a bigger role in creating uniform technical standards and designs across systems.
“So far the advisory committees that I am on have been wise in figuring out the right balance between what should be left to the vendors as they listen to their customers and what should be prescribed by the government,” Ms. Faulkner says.
About 250,000 doctors use Epic’s system, and “they give us a lot of feedback on design,” she says. “I haven’t seen an expert group that does better. Typically the wisdom of the crowd is better than direction from a small group.”
EPIC’S employees include doctors and nurses who visit customers’ sites to see what is and isn’t working. Last September, some 6,600 health care and information technology executives  and professionals also visited the company’s bucolic campus here for a users’ conference.
The giant slide — one of the many quirky features of the campus — was a popular diversion during the conference.
“I never would have expected to see a bunch of executives going down a slide,” says Aaron Webb, 28, a software developer from St. Cloud, Minn., who has worked at Epic for six years.
Ms. Faulkner has made it a point to offer a “cool” workplace even though her company is distant from Pacific beaches or Manhattan towers. As part of an Epic committee, she has bought some of its eye-catching artwork at community art fairs around Wisconsin.
“It is an incredible physical facility,” says Marjorie Klein, a retired professor of psychiatry, original investor and longtime Epic board member. “I think it supports employee creativity.”
The campus also has 15 acres of solar electric panels, thousands of geothermal wells for heating, and crops that are harvested for biomass fuel.
Epic broke ground for the Verona campus in 2002 and began moving its main operations there from Madison in 2004.  With the Kaiser contract in 2003 and the new business that followed, Epic has been expanding its acreage and adding buildings ever since. It now has 13 buildings and underground parking garages with 3.5 million square feet of space; a million more square feet is under construction.
That includes a sleek 5,000-square-foot data center — a far cry from the single computer in that basement in Madison that rattled like a washing machine three decades ago.

THE push to move the nation from paper to electronic health records is serious business. That’s why a first look at the campus of Epic Systems comes as something of a jolt.
A treehouse for meetings? A two-story spiral slide just for fun? What’s that big statue of the Cat in the Hat doing here?
Don’t let these elements of whimsy fool you. Operating on 800 acres of former farmland near Madison, Wis., Epic Systems supplies electronic records for large health care providers like the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, as well as health plans like Kaiser Permanente and medical groups like the Weill Cornell Physicians Organization in New York. In fact, Epic’s reputation as a fun-filled, creative place to work helps draw programmers who might otherwise take jobs at Google, Microsoft or Facebook.
Epic supplies software, systems, training and support so its customers can manage their data. As far as the general public is concerned, it operates far under the radar.

Or an M.R.I. scan cost less than a third as much, on average, in Canada?
Americans continue to spend more on health care than patients anywhere else. In 2009, we spent $7,960 per person, twice as much as France, which is known for providing very good health services. And for all that spending, we get very mixed results — some superb, some average, some inferior — compared with other advanced nations. Why this is true isn’t easily answered.
Health reform is supposed to control costs, but there is no simple avenue of attack. Our aging population has played a role in driving up medical costs, but Germany, Italy and Japan have much bigger percentages of elderly people while spending much less per capita on health care.
The spread of health insurance, which shields patients from price sensitivity, has played a role in driving up our spending. But almost all other advanced industrial nations cover virtually everyone, while we leave 50 million uninsured.
Administrative costs are high here — no surprise given the hordes of clerks and accountants needed to deal with insurance paperwork. And technological advances, which are sometimes highly beneficial and sometimes not, often cost a lot more than standard treatments. (Surprisingly, American doctors lag far behind their counterparts abroad in using electronic health records, which can help avoid costly errors and duplications.) Insurance companies’ profits and the high pay of their executives may account for some of the cost differences with other countries, but there is little good data on this.
A recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 34-member group that includes the most advanced industrial nations, concluded that spending is high here partly because the prices charged by American doctors and hospitals are higher than they are anywhere else.
The International Federation of Health Plans, in its 2010 comparative price report, documented just how large the price differential can be for a wide range of services. While it’s difficult to get data that is truly comparable from one country to another, the trends show Americans paying a lot more than people in other countries for the same services.
Measuring how effectively we spend health care dollars is hugely complicated. But cross-national surveys offer some clues. We’re good at giving patients what they want — if they ask for it. So Americans can see a specialist or get elective surgery a lot faster than patients in other countries, according to surveys by the Commonwealth Fund. The surveys also show that Americans are more likely than people in other advanced nations to experience medical errors or problems with uncoordinated care, and to forgo care because it’s too expensive.
The O.E.C.D. report rates America at or near the top for survival rates in breast and colorectal cancer but slightly below average in cervical cancer. We rank in the middle of the pack in the percentage of heart attack patients who die in the hospital within 30 days of admission. And we have alarmingly high rates of hospital admissions for asthma and uncontrolled diabetes — an indicator that many patients don’t have good primary care, which can prevent costly hospital stays.
Most other advanced countries hold down prices through government regulations. We set prices in Medicare and Medicaid programs. But in private markets, reform has to rely on other means, such as financial incentives for providers to curb costs by coordinating care and improving efficiency. One demonstration program significantly reduced spending by bundling payments to hospitals and doctors to cover all in-patient services connected with heart bypass surgeries.
The idea at the heart of the reform law is that such strategies, once proved effective, could be carried out on a large scale — and eventually bring total spending under control.

Re “Digitizing Health Records, Before It Was Cool” (Jan. 15), which described one company’s role in supplying electronic medical health records:
The article noted that companies’ varying platforms for these records “have raised concerns about usability, especially when different systems must share information” and that some people “wonder if the government should play a bigger role in creating uniform technical standards and designs.”
I am a practicing physician in a 12-provider private practice. My group has adopted an electronic platform from one company, while each of our two local health systems has a different one. We are linked to receive electronic information from one system, but the other does not provide it to us. We cannot send information to either.
Part of the 2009 federal stimulus package was meant to encourage and promote wider adoption of electronic records. Health systems and vendors should include portability with all providers in their systems in order to receive the stimulus.

A set of overlapping opinions in the case collectively suggested that a majority of the justices are prepared to apply broad privacy principles to bring the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable searches into the digital age, when law enforcement officials can gather extensive information without ever entering an individual’s home or vehicle.
Walter Dellinger, a lawyer for the defendant in the case and a former acting United States solicitor general, said the decision was “a signal event in Fourth Amendment history.”
“Law enforcement is now on notice,” Mr. Dellinger said, “that almost any use of GPS electronic surveillance of a citizen’s movement will be legally questionable unless a warrant is obtained in advance.”
An overlapping array of justices were divided on the rationale for the decision, with the majority saying the problem was the placement of the device on private property.
But five justices also discussed their discomfort with the government’s use of or access to various modern technologies, including video surveillance in public places, automatic toll collection systems on highways, devices that allow motorists to signal for roadside assistance, location data from cellphone towers and records kept by online merchants. 
The case concerned Antoine Jones, who was the owner of a Washington nightclub when the police came to suspect him of being part of a cocaine-selling operation. They placed a tracking device on his Jeep Grand Cherokee without a valid warrant, tracked his movements for a month and used the evidence they gathered to convict him of conspiring to sell cocaine. He was sentenced to life in prison.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned his conviction, saying the sheer amount of information that had been collected violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches. “Repeated visits to a church, a gym, a bar or a bookie tell a story not told by any single visit, as does one’s not visiting any of those places in the course of a month,” Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg wrote for the appeals court panel.
The Supreme Court affirmed that decision, but on a different ground. “We hold that the government’s installation of a GPS device on a target’s vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s movements, constitutes a ‘search,’ ” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor joined the majority opinion.
“It is important to be clear about what occurred in this case,” Justice Scalia went on. “The government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a ‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted.”
When the case was argued in November, a lawyer for the federal government said the number of times the federal authorities used GPS devices to track suspects was “in the low thousands annually.”
Vernon Herron, a former Maryland state trooper now on the staff of the University of Maryland’s Center for Health and Homeland Security, said state and local law enforcement officials used GPS and similar devices “all the time,” adding that “this type of technology is very useful for narcotics and terrorism investigations.”
Monday’s decision thus places a significant burden on widely used law enforcement surveillance techniques, though the authorities remain free to seek warrants from judges authorizing the surveillance.
In a concurrence for four justices, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. faulted the majority for trying to apply 18th-century legal concepts to 21st-century technologies. What should matter, he said, is the contemporary reasonable expectation of privacy.
“The use of longer-term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses,” Justice Alito wrote, “impinges on expectations of privacy.” Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan joined the concurrence.
“We need not identify with precision the point at which the tracking of this vehicle became a search, for the line was surely crossed before the four-week mark,” Justice Alito wrote. “Other cases may present more difficult questions.”
Justice Scalia said the majority did not mean to suggest that its property-rights theory of the Fourth Amendment displaced the one focused on expectations of privacy.
“It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question,” he wrote.
Justice Sotomayor joined the majority opinion, agreeing that many questions could be left for another day “because the government’s physical intrusion on Jones’s Jeep supplies a narrower basis for decision.”
But she left little doubt that she would have joined Justice Alito’s analysis had the issue he addressed been the exclusive one presented in the case.
“Physical intrusion is now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance,” Justice Sotomayor wrote.
She added that “it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.”
“People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers; and the books, groceries and medications they purchase to online retailers,” she wrote. “I, for one, doubt that people would accept without complaint the warrantless disclosure to the government of a list of every Web site they had visited in the last week, or month, or year.”
Justice Alito listed other “new devices that permit the monitoring of a person’s movements” that fit uneasily with traditional Fourth Amendment privacy analysis.
“In some locales,” he wrote, “closed-circuit television video monitoring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll roads, automatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the movements of motorists who choose to make use of that convenience. Many motorists purchase cars that are equipped with devices that permit a central station to ascertain the car’s location at any time so that roadside assistance may be provided if needed and the car may be found if it is stolen.”

Industry experts have said that electronic health records could generate huge savings — as much as $80 billion a year, according to a RAND Corporation estimate. The promise of cost savings has been a major justification for billions of dollars in federal spending to encourage doctors to embrace digital health records.
But research published Monday in the journal Health Affairs found that doctors using computers to track tests, like X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging, ordered far more tests than doctors relying on paper records.
The use of costly image-taking tests has increased sharply in recent years. Many experts contend that electronic health records will help reduce unnecessary and duplicative tests by giving doctors more comprehensive and up-to-date information when making diagnoses.
The study showed, however, that doctors with computerized access to a patient’s previous image results ordered tests on 18 percent of the visits, while those without the tracking technology ordered tests on 12.9 percent of visits. That is a 40 percent higher rate of image testing by doctors using electronic technology instead of paper records.
The gap, according to the study, was even greater — a 70 percent higher rate — for more advanced and expensive image tests, including M.R.I. tests and CT, or computerized tomography, scans.
“Our research raises real concerns about whether health information technology is going to be the answer to reducing costs,” said Dr. Danny McCormick, the lead author of the study, who is an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School and a member of the department of medicine at the Cambridge Health Alliance, a health system north of Boston.
Dr. McCormick had three co-authors: Dr. David H. Bor, chief of medicine at the Cambridge Health Alliance; and Dr. Stephanie Woolhandler and Dr. David U. Himmelstein, both professors at the City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College.
The research was based on a survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, which collected data from more than 28,000 patient visits to more than 1,100 doctors in 2008.
Health policy experts who have championed the adoption of electronic health records were critical of the study. They noted that the data came from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which is intended mainly for another purpose — to assess how medical care is practiced.
The study, they noted, included any kind of computer access to tracking images, no matter how old or isolated the function.
By contrast, modern electronic health records are meant to give doctors an integrated view of a patient’s care, including medical history, treatments, medications and past tests. The 2008 data predates federal incentive payments for doctors and standards for the “meaningful use” of electronic health records that began last year.
The new study, they said, was also at odds with previous research. It is “one of a small minority of studies” that have doubted the value of health information technology, said Dr. David Blumenthal, a professor at the Harvard Medical School.
Dr. Blumenthal, the former national coordinator for health information technology in the Obama administration, was co-author of a study, published last year in Health Affairs, that surveyed articles in professional journals in recent years on electronic health records.
It found that 92 percent of those articles were “positive over all” about the prospect that technology would improve the efficiency and quality of care.
But Dr. McCormick said the previous research had been primarily statistical models of expected savings, like the RAND study, or research that looked at the use of electronic health records at a relatively small number of flagship health systems.
“We looked at not just a few cutting-edge institutions, but a nationally representative sample,” Dr. McCormick said.
Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national coordinator for health information technology in the administration of George W. Bush, said he was unconvinced by the study’s conclusions because they were based on a correlation in the data and were not the result of a controlled test.
The study did not explore why physicians in computerized offices ordered more tests. Dr. McCormick speculated that digital technology might simply make ordering tests easier.
Dr. McCormick said he hoped the study would damp any inflated expectations about electronic records. But he added that the technology can improve the actual practice of medicine.
The Cambridge Health Alliance, where he practices, made the switch to electronic records in 2005.
“I’m a primary care doctor,” Dr. McCormick said, “and I would never go back.”

A new study published in Health Affairs, disputes that, suggesting that office-based physicians who have access to electronic records of patient care are actually more likely to order additional imaging tests and laboratory tests than doctors who rely on paper records.
There are many other studies that support the value of computerization. But this one raises an important cautionary note for the federal government, which is spending billions of dollars to encourage the adoption of digital medical records. It is another reminder that there are no easy fixes for rising health care costs and that the structure for delivering care may have to be changed to reward doctors for prescribing only the appropriate tests.
The study was based on a 2008 federal survey that collected data from 28,000 patient visits to 1,100 doctors. It found that doctors who could call up electronic images of a patient’s previous imaging tests —such as X-rays and CT scans — ordered new imaging tests in 18 percent of the visits; physicians without such access ordered imaging on only 12.9 percent of the visits. The rate was 70 percent higher for the most advanced and expensive images.
The study did not explore why. But its leader, Dr. Danny McCormick, an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School, suggested that the ease of ordering tests and receiving results by computer may encourage doctors to order more tests than they would if they had to get results by phone and interpret blurry fax images.
The study’s authors argue that previous research that showed savings were done at leading medical centers with sophisticated technology. Many doctors’ offices buy off-the-shelf systems, primarily for billing purposes, that may not be able to track down redundancies or lack software to help doctors decide if a test is appropriate.
We still believe that widespread adoption of electronic medical records will improve care and reduce costs. It is also clear that many office-based physicians will need help in making the transition. No matter how adept doctors become with computerized records, they will need to be pushed to rein in excessive use of tests.

In April, when it was close to bursting through his skin, he went to the emergency room. Doctors told him it was malignant and urged surgery.
His wife called every major insurance company she found on the Internet, but none would cover him: His cancer was a pre-existing condition. In desperation, the Richters agreed to pay half their hospital bill, knowing they could never afford it on their combined salaries of $36,000 a year.
No other group of Americans faces higher stakes in the impending Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act than those with pre-existing conditions. The law, once its major provisions take effect, would prohibit insurance companies from turning people away or charging them more because they are sick. In exchange, most Americans would be required to have insurance, broadening the base of paying customers with an infusion of healthy people. Those who did not buy insurance would be subject to financial penalties.
The Government Accountability Office estimates that 36 million to 122 million adults under 65 have a pre-existing condition. As many as 17 million do not have insurance. Many try to buy coverage on the individual market, but in most states that is either impossible or too costly.
Experts are divided on what the ruling will bring for this group of Americans. If the mandate that everyone buy coverage is struck down, the Obama administration and the insurance industry say that the protections for people with pre-existing conditions should be, too. If the ailing pile in without the larger pool of healthy people, premiums would skyrocket, insurers say.
“When you have insurance reforms without requiring everyone to participate, it becomes a sickness fund, not an insurance system,” said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, favors repeal of the law. He said last week that he would preserve coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but only if they had been insured before and lost coverage when they were laid off or changed jobs, a more limited protection than the current law provides. He did not explain how he would get insurers to cover such people.
Some experts argue that even if the mandate is struck down, along with protections for people with pre-existing conditions, there are still options that could lift them to a more secure place.
States would still have regulatory powers, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, and the law contains tools to encourage voluntary participation. The penalty for people who do not participate is so weak, she added, that even with the mandate, enrollment was expected to be low at first anyway.
It is people like Eric Richter and his wife, Dani — uninsured and living in the unstable space between poverty and the middle class — that the law was intended to help. They earned too much to qualify for government-sponsored health care, but worked in jobs that did not come with health benefits.
Under the law, about half the newly insured would be covered by Medicaid, which would extend to individuals earning less than $15,400. The other half, the working poor, individuals with incomes up to $44,600, would receive subsidies.
According to a subsidy calculator provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Richters’ insurance premium would be $165 a month under the new law, a sum they said they would eagerly pay. The small stone drilling firm where Mr. Richter works offers no health coverage, and the family could not afford the more than $600 a month it would have cost to buy it on their own.
“It’s hard to pay for the unknown, when you’re struggling to cover the known,” said Mr. Richter, who is 39. “I know it sounds irresponsible, but that’s just the way it was. It’s a game of roulette you hope you’re going to win.”
After he got the tumor on his leg, the couple said, Mr. Richter tried to better his odds. He cut out sugar and ate beets he grew in his garden because he heard that might help. But the bump kept growing. His wife sewed him special pants to accommodate its size, as big as a melon. He started standing in church. Driving was excruciating.
When they found he had cancer, the family struggled with how they would pay for his care. Once he was turned away from a scan because he did not have insurance. Eventually a doctor took him under his wing, and insisted he be treated.
In late May, Mr. Richter had surgery. He is waiting for the bill. He has not been able to work as he recuperates.
But a piece of bad luck may solve the family’s insurance problem, at least for now. Mrs. Richter lost her job at an electronic records firm. A hospital financial adviser told them that with their income effectively zero and the medical bills mounting, they might qualify for Medicaid. They are waiting to hear.
“We’re back to crossing our fingers,” Mrs. Richter said.
The Richters would benefit from the law, but in a sign of how poorly it is understood, they said their impression was that it would force people to pay for something they cannot afford. “That’s not going to go over well,” Mr. Richter said. The law includes an exemption for people who cannot afford the premium even with the subsidy.
Currently, uninsured people with pre-existing conditions often end up getting care, but at tremendous cost to the public, hospitals, and themselves. Some divorce to have household incomes small enough to qualify for Medicaid. Others get help from hospital charities. Still others rack up large bills that go to debt collection agencies.
JoAnna Hanson, a mother of three in Lincoln, Neb., who works the night shift at a Walmart, said she tried for years to get health insurance, but because of a rare kidney ailment did not succeed. When a cyst burst in an ovary several years ago and she was rushed to the hospital, her bill was sent to a collection agency. A total of $330 a month is now sliced from her and her husband’s paychecks, more than a tenth of their income.
“The thing we worry about most is, do we pay the rent or do we feed our kids?” said Ms. Hanson, who is 34. They have not paid rent on their trailer’s lot in three months.
Still, though the law would benefit her, she does not like it.
“I don’t think it’s right because you can’t force someone to buy something when they can’t afford it,” she said.
But some of those already benefiting from the law like it. Pamela Garland, a retired corrections officer in Lincoln, Neb., found herself uninsured with a cancer diagnosis in February. No one would cover her, and after 44 years of marriage, she and her husband, Norman, even considered divorce so Mrs. Garland, who is 63, could qualify for Medicaid.
One night in April, up late in the hospital computer center, Mr. Garland found a better solution: The Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, financed through the new law, would take his wife despite her tumor. The plan offers subsidized coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The $421 monthly premium was based on her age, not her illness.
“It was the best thing that our government has done for us in many, many years,” he said, sitting in the small apartment they rent since selling their house to help pay medical bills.
Without that coverage, Mr. Garland said, his wife probably would not have gotten the quality of care she later received — a new high-tech radiation treatment that stopped the tumor growth near her spine and cost about $107,000. The plan, intended as a bridge, is set to expire on Jan. 1, 2014, when major provisions of the law are scheduled to take effect.
With the law’s fate uncertain, participants in the plan are worried, like Maryann Kaine, 52, a music store owner in Fredricksburg, Va., who signed up for the program after she was shut out of her family’s policy because she had had surgery on her back.
“I can’t imagine that they’ll just dump all of us back out into the world of no coverage,” she said.

It took the lead in guaranteeing near-universal health insurance coverage for its residents, providing a template for the federal reforms to follow.
Now a bill passed last week by the Legislature — and enthusiastically endorsed by Gov. Deval Patrick — aims to tackle the much harder problem of controlling health care costs. Massachusetts will be the first state to try to cap overall health care spending, both private and public, so that it will grow no faster than the state economy.
The state was able to reach near-universal coverage because the vast majority of its population was already covered by some form of insurance. It also could subsidize coverage for the uninsured using a big pool of money that had been used for charity care.
But when it comes to controlling health care costs, Massachusetts has no advantage, and in fact is starting behind most other states. Its costs are among the highest in the nation, and they have been growing in recent years at 6 percent to 7 percent while the economy has been growing at less than 4 percent. That bleak picture may be changing. The growth rate of health costs has slowed significantly over the past year or two, but nobody knows if this is a temporary or lasting change.
The new legislation sets a very ambitious target: to hold the annual increase in total health care spending to the rate of growth of the state’s gross domestic product for the first five years, through 2017, and then even lower for the next five years, to half a percentage point below the economy’s growth rate. The savings are projected to be as high as $200 billion over a 15-year period.
Setting goals is a necessary step, but there is skepticism among health care analysts that these targets could be met in such a short time given the lack of a strong enforcement mechanism in the legislation.
That does not mean the bill is completely toothless. It will establish a commission to monitor the growth in spending and require that health care providers or insurers explain themselves if their costs rise above the target growth rate. If there is no valid reason, the commission can demand that an organization submit a plan to bring its spending back in line. As a last resort, the commission can impose a $500,000 fine if it finds that the organization failed to make a good-faith effort. Many analysts expect the state will have to become increasingly aggressive in demanding cost cutting by providers and insurers if savings do not materialize.
The bill also contains other policy changes. It encourages more hospitals and doctors to set up “accountable care organizations” that would move away from traditional fee-for-service billing, which encourages needless tests and procedures. How successful those organizations will be at cutting costs is uncertain.
The law requires the state’s Medicaid program, state employee health care program and all other state-financed health care programs to adopt alternatives to fee-for-service payments, like paying a flat fee for all the care a patient will need over a year or bundling payments for doctors and hospitals to coordinate a patient’s care.
Other useful provisions include a requirement that health care providers report regularly on cost trends and quality measures, which should help patients shop comparatively; a new $60 million fund to invest in programs to reduce obesity, diabetes, asthma and other chronic diseases; $30 million to accelerate conversion to electronic health records; and malpractice reforms that could reduce litigation without imposing caps on damage awards.
Some critics worry that the state will not have the personnel and resources to do an effective job of enforcing these provisions. Others warn that the bill could impose burdensome regulations on health care providers and damage a cornerstone of the state’s economy.
Still, hospital and doctors’ groups have been supportive, and the bill was approved unanimously in the Senate and overwhelmingly in the Assembly. That may be a sign, some say, that the bill lacks the teeth needed to control the way providers set prices.
But don’t count Massachusetts out. It led the way in expanding coverage. What happens there on cost control will offer valuable lessons for the rest of the country.

Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. and the health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, cited “troubling indications” that some providers are billing for services never provided and vowed to prosecute. They sent a letter to five major hospital trade associations on Monday, two days after an article in The Times described in detail how greater use of electronic records might be making it easier for hospitals and doctors to submit erroneous payment claims.
A Times analysis of Medicare data compiled by the American Hospital Directory found that hospitals received $1 billion more in Medicare reimbursements in 2010 than they had in 2006, at least in part by changing the billing codes they assign to patients in emergency rooms.
The findings involved two kinds of potential abuses. One is “cloning,” in which a doctor cuts and pastes information from a patient’s electronic record to suggest that the services were performed again at the later date, or possibly uses the same documentation for other patients as well. The other is “upcoding,” in which hospitals may exaggerate the intensity of care provided or the severity of a patient’s condition to justify higher billings.
Similar abuses appear to be occurring in how doctors charge Medicare for office visits, according to regulators and a parallel investigation by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization. There may be innocent explanations for some of these higher claims. Doctors may have underbilled in the past and now find it easier to meet billing and reporting requirements thanks to electronic records. In some hospitals, the patients may actually be sicker than in previous years.
But The Times’s reporters found disturbing evidence of sales pitches by software vendors telling doctors they could increase their incomes with the help of electronic records, huge error rates detected by contractors handling Medicare claims in Texas and Oklahoma, and a case where an emergency room doctor in Virginia billed Medicare for a complete physical exam, which was never done.
The administration is taking a properly forceful approach. It has stepped up its monitoring and prosecutions for fraud. It should also move more quickly to set up national guidelines on how to bill properly for services.
Electronic health records have great potential to track patient care and prevent costly duplicate services. It is important that they not be undermined by abuses during the phase-in period.

Small wonder that the idea has been promoted by the Obama administration, with strong bipartisan and industry support. The government has given $6.5 billion in incentives, and hospitals and doctors have spent billions more.
But as health care providers adopt electronic records, the challenges have proved daunting, with a potential for mix-ups and confusion that can be frustrating, costly and even dangerous.
Some doctors complain that the electronic systems are clunky and time-consuming, designed more for bureaucrats than physicians. Last month, for example, the public health system in Contra Costa County in California slowed to a crawl under a new information-technology system.
Doctors told county supervisors they were able to see only half as many patients as usual as they struggled with the unfamiliar screens and clicks. Nurses had similar concerns. At the county jail, they said, a mistaken order for a high dose of a dangerous heart medicine was caught just in time.
The first national coordinator for health information technology, Dr. David J. Brailer, was appointed in 2004, by President George W. Bush. Dr. Brailer encouraged the beginnings of the switch from paper charts to computers. But in an interview last month, he said: “The current information tools are still difficult to set up. They are hard to use. They fit only parts of what doctors do, and not the rest.”
Long before computers, many hospitals and doctors charged for services in ways that maximized insurance payments. Now critics say electronic records make fraudulent billing all too easy, and suspected abuses are under investigation by the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Like all computerized systems, electronic records are vulnerable to crashes. Parts of the system at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were down recently for six hours over two days; the hospital had an alternate database that kept patients’ histories available until the problem was fixed.
Even the internationally respected Mayo Clinic, which treats more than a million patients a year, has serious unresolved problems after working for years to get its three major electronic records systems to talk to one another. Dr. Dawn S. Milliner, the chief medical informatics officer at Mayo, said her people were “working actively on a number of fronts” to make the systems “interoperable” but acknowledged, “We have not solved that yet.”
Still, Dr. Milliner added that even though there a lot of challenges, the benefits of information technology are “enormous” — improved safety and quality of care, convenience for patients and better outcomes in general.
Patients at Mayo’s headquarters in Rochester, Minn., and its Arizona and Florida sites can see their records online, even via an iPhone app; those in Mayo’s network of doctors’ offices and hospitals in the upper Midwest will eventually have similar access.
In the rare event that a large-scale system goes down at Mayo, backup measures are ready, teams are called in to make rapid repairs, and if necessary “everyone is ready to go on paper,” Dr. Milliner said.
Reliable data about problems in the electronic systems is hard to come by, hidden by a virtual code of silence enforced by fears of lawsuits and bad publicity. A recent study commissioned by the government sketches the magnitude of the problem, calling for tools to report problems and to prevent them.
Based on error rates in other industries, the report estimates that if and when electronic health records are fully adopted, they could be linked to at least 60,000 adverse events a year.
The report, to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, analyzed ways of forestalling hundreds of information technology “hazards” at seven hospitals and health systems. A typical example would be drug orders transmitted by an electronic app to a pharmacy using a different app.
“It’s hard to keep them speaking the same language, to automatically link a medication in one app to exactly the same medication and dose in the other app,” said Dr. James M. Walker, chief health information officer of the Geisinger Health System, who led the study.
The Obama administration will issue a report on patient safety issues in early November, the current national coordinator, Dr. Farzad Mostashari, said in an interview. That report was requested last year by a panel on health I.T. safety at the Institute of Medicine, a unit of the National Academies of Science.
The institute recommended that the government create an independent agency like the National Safety Transportation Board to deal with patient safety issues, and it called for an end to “hold harmless” clauses that protect software manufacturers from lawsuits but can limit the freedom of doctors and hospitals to publicly raise questions about errors or defects.
Elisabeth Belmont, a lawyer for the MaineHealth system, based in Portland, advises hospitals to reject contract language that could leave them responsible for settling claims for patient injuries caused by software problems. “One software vendor was surprised when my client opted to walk away and purchase the software from another vendor who had a more reasonable approach on these issues,” she said.
The institute also recommended that software manufacturers be required to report deaths, serious injuries or unsafe conditions related to information technology. So far, however, neither a new safety agency nor such a reporting system has been adopted.
Some of the largest software companies have opposed any mandatory reporting requirement. But Gail L. Warden, chairman of the institute’s patient safety panel, said in an interview that the industry was divided on the issue; some companies were accustomed to regulations for their widely used medical devices for imaging, for example.
Critics are deeply skeptical that electronic records are ready for prime time. “The technology is being pushed, with no good scientific basis,” said Dr. Scot M. Silverstein, a health I.T. expert at Drexel University who reports on medical records problems on the blog Health Care Renewal. He says testing these systems on patients without their consent “raises ethical questions.”
Another critic, Dr. Scott A. Monteith, a psychiatrist and health I.T. consultant in Michigan, notes that Medicare and insurance companies generally do not pay for experimental treatments that have not proved their effectiveness.
A Medicare administrative contractor, National Government Services, said recently that it would deny payment for treatments using “cloned documentation” copied from electronic records rather than individualized patient notes composed by doctors and nurses to show medical necessity. Dr. Monteith said the electronic systems were “disrupting traditional medical records and, beyond that, how we think” — the process of arriving at a diagnosis. For example, the diagnosing process can include “looking at six pieces of paper,” he said. “We cannot do that on a monitor. It really affects how we think.”
Deborah Burger, a registered nurse for more than 30 years who works with pain medicines and anti-anxiety drugs for colonoscopy patients, said electronic systems offered “drop-down menus of so-called best practices.”
“The problem is each patient is an individual,” said Ms. Burger, who is president of the California Nurses Association. “We need the ability to change that care plan, based on age and sex and other factors.”
She acknowledged that the system had one advantage: overcoming the ancient problem of bad handwriting. “It makes it easier for me to read progress notes that physicians have written, and vice versa,” she said.
Some experts said they were hopeful that the initial problems with electronic records would be settled over time. Dr. Brailer, who now heads Health Evolution Partners, a venture capital firm in San Francisco, said that “most of the clunky first-generation tools” would be replaced in 10 years. “As the industry continues to grind forward, costs will go down,” he said. “Tools are being simplified.”
Mark V. Pauly, professor of health care management at the Wharton School, said the health I.T. industry was moving in the right direction but that it had a long way to go before it would save real money.
“Like so many other things in health care,” Dr. Pauly said, “the amount of accomplishment is well short of the amount of cheerleading.”

Optimistic predictions by RAND in 2005 helped drive explosive growth in the electronic records industry and encouraged the federal government to give billions of dollars in financial incentives to hospitals and doctors that put the systems in place.
“We’ve not achieved the productivity and quality benefits that are unquestionably there for the taking,” said Dr. Arthur L. Kellermann, one of the authors of a reassessment by RAND that was published in this month’s edition of Health Affairs, an academic journal.
RAND’s 2005 report was paid for by a group of companies, including General Electric and Cerner Corporation, that have profited by developing and selling electronic records systems to hospitals and physician practices. Cerner’s revenue has nearly tripled since the report was released, to a projected $3 billion in 2013, from $1 billion in 2005.
The report predicted that widespread use of electronic records could save the United States health care system at least $81 billion a year, a figure RAND now says was overstated. The study was widely praised within the technology industry and helped persuade Congress and the Obama administration to authorize billions of dollars in federal stimulus money in 2009 to help hospitals and doctors pay for the installation of electronic records systems.
“RAND got a lot of attention and a lot of buzz with the original analysis,” said Dr. Kellermann, who was not involved in the 2005 study. “The industry quickly embraced it.”
But evidence of significant savings is scant, and there is increasing concern that electronic records have actually added to costs by making it easier to bill more for some services.
Health care spending has risen $800 billion since the first report was issued, according to federal figures. The reasons are many, from the aging of the baby boomer population, to the cost of medical advances, to higher usage of medical services over all.
Officials at RAND said their new analysis did not try to put a dollar figure on how much electronic record-keeping had helped or hurt efforts to reduce costs. But the firm’s acknowledgment that its earlier analysis was overly optimistic adds to a chorus of concern about the cost of the new systems and the haste with which they have been adopted.
The recent analysis was sharply critical of the commercial systems now in place, many of which are hard to use and do not allow doctors and patients to share medical information across systems. “We could be getting much more if we could take the time to do a little more planning and to set more standards,” said Marc Probst, chief information officer for Intermountain Healthcare, a large health system in Salt Lake City that developed its own electronic records system and is cited by RAND as an example of how the technology can help improve care and reduce costs.
The RAND researchers pointed to a number of other reasons the expected savings had not materialized. The rate of adoption has been slow, they said, and electronic records do not address the fact that doctors and hospitals reap the benefits of high volumes of care.
Many experts say the available systems seem to be aimed more at increasing billing by providers than at improving care or saving money. Federal regulators are investigating whether electronic records make it easier for hospitals and doctors to bill for services they did not provide and whether Medicare and other federal agencies are adequately monitoring the use of electronic records.
Technology “is only a tool,” said Dr. David Blumenthal, who helped oversee the federal push for the adoption of electronic records under President Obama and is now president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit health group. “Like any tool, it can be used well or poorly.” While there is strong evidence that electronic records can contribute to better care and more efficiency, Dr. Blumenthal said, the systems in place do not always work in ways that help achieve those benefits.
Federal officials say they are drafting new rules to address many of the concerns about the current systems.
A handful of lawsuits have been filed over the systems. In the fall of 2010, for example, Girard Medical Center, a small hospital in Crawford County, Kan., hired Cerner Corporation to install an electronic records system. The hospital was hoping to obtain federal financing for it.
But after receiving $1.3 million in payments, Cerner employees failed to get the system up and running in time for the hospital to qualify for federal incentive payments. The company then notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner last year. The case is in arbitration. A lawyer for Girard and a spokeswoman for Cerner declined to comment.
Late last year, a physician practice in Panama City, Fla., filed a lawsuit against the health care technology firm Allscripts after the company stopped supporting an electronic records system called MyWay that it had sold to 5,000 small-group physicians at a cost of $40,000 per physician. The lawsuit said that the system had problems and that the physician group was unable to meet the criteria for federal incentive money. A spokeswoman for Allscripts said it would defend itself vigorously.
The 2005 RAND report helped Cerner executives and others sell the new systems, despite criticism at the time that the analysis was too rosy. RAND said that the report was not influenced by its financial backers and that, in fact, it disclosed the corporate sponsorship prominently in the report itself.
The study was harshly criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating expected savings.
The new analysis was not sponsored by any corporations, said Dr. Kellermann, who added that some members of RAND’s health advisory board wanted to revisit the earlier analysis.
Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the nation’s first health information czar under President George W. Bush, said he still believed tens of billions of dollars could eventually be squeezed out of the health care system through the use of electronic records. In his view, the “colossal strategic error” that occurred was a result of the Obama administration’s incentive program.
“The vast sum of stimulus money flowing into health information technology created a ‘race to adopt’ mentality — buy the systems today to get government handouts, but figure out how to make them work tomorrow,” Dr. Brailer said.

Although the chief goal has been to improve efficiency and cut costs, a disappointing report published last week by the RAND Corp. found that electronic health records actually may be raising the nation’s medical bills.
But the report neglected one powerful incentive for the switch to electronic records: the resulting databases of clinical information are gold mines for medical research. The monitoring and analysis of electronic medical records, some scientists say, have the potential to make every patient a participant in a vast, ongoing clinical trial, pinpointing treatments and side effects that would be hard to discern from anecdotal case reports or expensive clinical trials.
“Medical discoveries have always been based on hunches,” said Dr. Russ B. Altman, a physician and professor of bioengineering and genetics at Stanford. “Unfortunately, we have been missing discoveries all along because we didn’t have the ability to see if a hunch has statistical merit. This infrastructure makes it possible to follow up those hunches.”
The use of electronic records also may help scientists avoid sidestep the rising costs of medical research. “In the past, you had to set up incredibly expensive and time-consuming clinical trials to test a hypothesis,” said Nicholas Tatonetti, assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia. “Now we can look at data already collected in electronic medical records and begin to tease out information.”
Recent work by Dr. Altman and Dr. Tatonetti, published in 2011, offers a compelling case study. As a graduate student at Stanford, Dr. Tatonetti devised an algorithm to look for pairs of drugs that, taken together, cause a side effect not associated with either drug alone. One pairing popped up when he used his new software to search the Food and Drug Administration’s database of adverse drug reports: Paxil, a widely used antidepressant, and Pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug.
Neither was known to raise blood sugar, but Dr. Tatonetti’s results suggested they might when taken together.
For confirmation, he and Dr. Altman turned to Stanford University Medical Center’s electronic medical records. The scientists needed to find patients who were prescribed either Paxil or Pravastatin, had a blood sugar test, were then prescribed the second medication, and had another blood sugar test — all within a period of a few months.
Finding such patients was a tall order, but the medical center’s database was large enough that eight cases surfaced. In most, patients had experienced a significant increase in blood sugar. The researchers expanded their search to databases at Harvard and Vanderbilt. They found about 130 cases that fit the improbable criteria — and more evidence that patients given both drugs showed a rise in blood sugar.
The F.D.A. is currently evaluating the data to see if they warrant new information on the drugs’ labels. “I underestimated the abilities of a clever informatician to figure out algorithms for data mining,” said Dr. Altman, once a critic of this sort of “data mining.”
“We didn’t need to set up a clinical trial,” he said. “We didn’t need to enroll a single research subject.”
Kaiser Permanente, which documented the connection between Vioxx and heart trouble nearly a decade ago by reviewing internal medical records, is now testing preliminary evidence that men taking statin drugs for cholesterol have a lower risk of a recurrence of prostate cancer. The organization is also evaluating diabetes protocols, using a database of more than 25,000 people over age 80 with diabetes — a difficult population to study in clinical trials.
“That’s a remarkably rare opportunity to look at a population that has many other health issues going on,” said Elizabeth A. McGlynn, director of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Effectiveness and Safety Research. “The sheer volume and the richness of the data will enable us to have insights that are beyond anything we could have had any other way.”
But the challenges posed by this sort of research are significant. The information entered into a medical record may be wrong, and diagnostic codes are notoriously unreliable, according to Dr. Tatonetti, partly because they are also used for billing. And doctors don’t think like researchers.
“If a patient gets well after treatment, a physician may not feel the need to follow up with a lab test because it doesn’t have any clinical usefulness,” Dr. Altman said. “But that’s exactly the kind of data a researcher looks for.”
Perhaps the most pressing issue is patient privacy. Electronic health records must be “de-identified” before they can be used for research. That requires more than simply removing a name. Any information that might identify the patient must be excised. At the same time, researchers have to be able to tell when they’re looking at records from the same patient, which may be stored in several databases.
“One patient may be in as many as 20 different databases,” said Dr. William S. Dalton, founding director of the Personalized Medicine Institute at Moffitt Cancer Center, which is currently tracking more than 90,000 patients at 18 different sites around the country. Moffitt combines information from the electronic medical record with data from X-rays and other imaging studies, tumor tissue cultures and even genetic profiles.
“There’s an immense amount of information and different databases, all using different data dictionaries,” Dr. Dalton said. “And they don’t all agree.”
Kaiser Permanente, which has a database of 9 million patients, stores about 30 petabytes of data — more than three times the digitized storage of the Library of Congress. The organization adds about two terabytes of data a day. (A petabyte is a thousand terabytes, and a terabyte is a thousand gigabytes.)
Despite the challenges, a growing number of academic medical centers and health organizations are de-identifying patient records to make them available to researchers.
The University of California’s medical centers and hospitals recently merged systems to create a database with more than 11 million patient records. The F.D.A. has launched a rapid-response surveillance system, called Mini-Sentinel, that combines data from the medical records of more than 100 million individuals. In another collaboration, called eMerge, institutions around the country are combining genetic information with electronic medical record data.
The gold standard of medical research, the randomized, controlled trial, or R.C.T., isn’t going to go away, experts say. But evidence culled from electronic medical records promises to broaden knowledge beyond what can be learned in a carefully structured study.
“R.C.T.’s have their own sorts of biases,” said Dr. Jonathan Darer, in the division of clinical innovation at Geisinger Health System. “Frequently they exclude the most important populations. It’s great to do guidelines for patients who only have diabetes, for example. Unfortunately those aren’t the patients I see in my clinic, where they also have osteoporosis or hypertension or dementia and other health problems. What I really need is help with those complex patients.”
Electronic records are “way less controlled, way less scientifically designed” than the information-gathering techniques used in huge trials, Dr. Altman said. But they offer researchers far more data to work with.
“There’s a growing sense in the field of informatics that we’ll take lots of data in exchange for perfectly controlled data,” he said. “You can deal with the noise if the signal is strong enough.”

While proponents say new record-keeping technologies will one day reduce costs and improve care, profits and sales are soaring now across the records industry. At Allscripts, annual sales have more than doubled from $548 million in 2009 to an estimated $1.44 billion last year, partly reflecting daring acquisitions made on the bet that the legislation would be a boon for the industry. At the Cerner Corporation of Kansas City, Mo., sales rose 60 percent during that period. With money pouring in, top executives are enjoying Wall Street-style paydays.
None of that would have happened without the health records legislation that was included in the 2009 economic stimulus bill — and the lobbying that helped produce it. Along the way, the records industry made hundreds of thousands of dollars of political contributions to both Democrats and Republicans. In some cases, the ties went deeper. Glen E. Tullman, until recently the chief executive of Allscripts, was health technology adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign. As C.E.O. of Allscripts, he visited the White House no fewer than seven times after President Obama took office in 2009, according to White House records.
Mr. Tullman, who left Allscripts late last year after a boardroom power struggle, characterized his activities in Washington as an attempt to educate lawmakers and the administration.
“We really haven’t done any lobbying,” Mr. Tullman said in an interview. “I think it’s very common with every administration that when they want to talk about the automotive industry, they convene automotive executives, and when they want to talk about the Internet, they convene Internet executives.”
Between 2008 and 2012, a time of intense lobbying in the area around the passage of the legislation and how the rules for government incentives would be shaped, Mr. Tullman personally made $225,000 in political contributions. While tens of thousands of those dollars went to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, money was also being sprinkled toward Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic senator from Montana who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Jay D. Rockefeller, the Democrat from West Virginia who heads the Commerce Committee. Mr. Tullman said his recent personal contributions to various politicians had largely been driven by his interest in supporting President Obama and in seeing his re-election.
Cerner’s lobbying dollars doubled to nearly $400,000 between 2006 and last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While its political action committee contributed a little to some Democrats in 2008, including Senator Baucus, its contributions last year went almost entirely to Republicans, with a large amount going to the Mitt Romney campaign.
Current and former industry executives say that big digital records companies like Cerner, Allscripts and Epic Systems of Verona, Wis., have reaped enormous rewards because of the legislation they pushed for. “Nothing that these companies did in my eyes was spectacular,” said John Gomez, the former head of technology at Allscripts. “They grew as a result of government incentives.”
Executives at smaller records companies say the legislation cemented the established companies’ leading positions in the field, making it difficult for others to break into the business and innovate. Until the 2009 legislation, growth at the leading records firms was steady; since then, it has been explosive. Annual sales growth at Cerner, for instance, has doubled to 20 percent from 10 percent.
“We called it the Sunny von Bülow bill. These companies that should have been dead were being put on machines and kept alive for another few years,” said Jonathan Bush, co-founder of the cloud-based firm Athenahealth and a first cousin to former President George W. Bush. “The biggest players drew this incredible huddle around the rule-makers and the rules are ridiculously favorable to these companies and ridiculously unfavorable to society.”
This industry, which was pioneered in the late 1970s, first gained widespread attention in 2004 when President Bush in his State of the Union speech called for digitizing national health records.
“After that, every technology C.E.O. wanting a piece of health care would have visited me every day if I had let them,” said David Brailer, whom President Bush appointed as the nation’s first health information czar. Over the next few years, Cerner and many of the other health care data companies increased their presence on Capitol Hill.
The records systems sold by the biggest vendors have their fans, who argue that, among other things, the systems ease prescribing medications electronically. But these systems also have many critics, who contend that they can be difficult to use, cannot share patient information with other systems and are sometimes adding hours to the time physicians spend documenting patient care.
“On a really good day, you might be able to call the system mediocre, but most of the time, it’s lousy,” said Michael Callaham, the chairman of the department of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, which eight months ago turned on its $160 million digital records system from Epic. Michael Blum, the hospital’s chief medical information officer, said a majority of doctors there like the Epic system.
Whatever the case, the legislation has been a windfall to top executives at the leading health records companies. Neal L. Patterson, who grew up on a farm near Manchester, Okla., population 100, co-founded Cerner in 1979. As Cerner’s sales have soared in recent years, so have Mr. Patterson’s fortunes. From 2007 to 2011, he received more than $21 million in total compensation, according to the executive compensation research firm Equilar, and his stake in the company is worth $1 billion.
In recent years, Mr. Patterson and his wife, Jeanne Lillig-Patterson, who ran as a Republican for Congress in 2004, have emerged as social and business leaders in the Kansas City, Mo., area. Mr. Patterson is also co-owner of a real estate development firm whose ventures include a 1,200-acre community near Kansas City called the Village of Loch Lloyd, featuring a Tom Watson-designed golf course.
A spokeswoman for Cerner said Mr. Patterson was unavailable for comment.
The medical records industry did not have much of a presence in Washington before President Bush highlighted it in 2004. Then in November that year, the industry created its first association, HIMSS, which includes health care providers, corporations and not-for-profit organizations, to make the case for electronic records. Its founding members included Allscripts, Cerner and Epic.
Four years later, in December 2008, H. Stephen Lieber, chief executive of the group, wrote an open letter to President-elect Obama calling for a minimum government investment of $25 billion to help hospitals and physicians adopt electronic records. The industry ultimately got at least $19 billion in federal and state money.
In the months after that windfall arrived, sales climbed for leading vendors as hospitals and physicians scrambled to buy systems to meet tight timetables to collect the incentive dollars. At Allscripts, Mr. Tullman soon announced what looked like a game-changing deal: the acquisition of another records company, Eclipsys, for $1.3 billion.
“We are at the beginning of what we believe will be the fastest transformation of any industry in U.S. history,” Mr. Tullman said when the deal was announced.
Last spring, some of the Eclipsys board members left after a power struggle; Mr. Tullman left in December. He is now at a company he co-founded that focuses on solar energy — another area that, after Obama administration and Congress expanded government incentives in the 2009 stimulus bill, has been swept by a gold-rush mentality, too.

The organization, which combines a nonprofit insurance plan with its own hospitals and clinics, is the kind of holistic health system that President Obama’s health care law encourages.
Kaiser has sophisticated electronic records and computer systems that — after 10 years and $30 billion in technology spending — have led to better-coordinated patient care, another goal of the president. And because the plan is paid a fixed amount for medical care per member, there is a strong financial incentive to keep people healthy and out of the hospital, the same goal of the hundreds of accountable care organizations now being created.
“Over the course of the last 15 years, they’ve been just going into high gear and doing everything right,” said Dr. Thomas S. Bodenheimer, a health policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco who recently chose Kaiser as his own health plan.
Yet even with all of its effort, its chairman and chief executive, George C. Halvorson, acknowledges Kaiser has yet to achieve the holy grail of delivering that care at a low enough cost. He says he and other health systems must fundamentally rethink what they do or risk having cost controls imposed on them either by the government or by employers, who are absorbing the bulk of health insurance costs. “We think the future of health care is going to be rationing or re-engineering,” he said.
Mr. Halvorson is convinced that Kaiser’s improvements in the quality of care save money. But he also says that the way to get costs lower is to move care farther and farther from the hospital setting — and even out of doctors’ offices. Kaiser is experimenting with ways to provide care at home or over the Internet, without the need for a physical office visit at all. He also argues that lower costs are going to be about finding ways to get people to take more responsibility for their health — for losing weight, for example, or bringing their blood pressure down.
“The obesity work is incredibly difficult,” he said. “It’s very, very hard to move the needle.”
Other health care experts say that while Kaiser has a place in the future, whether it is the best model for the country’s health care remains unclear. “They have not translated some of their strengths into better prices,” said David Lansky, the president and chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents employers on the West Coast, many of whom purchase coverage from Kaiser for their workers.
And there are other concerns, such as whether an all-encompassing system like Kaiser’s can really be replicated and whether the limits it places on where patients can seek care will be accepted by enough people to make a difference. Or whether, as the nation’s flirtation with health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.’s, in the 1990s showed — people will balk at the concept of not being able to go to any doctor or hospital of their choice.
“The more you restrict the patient’s ability to do what they want, you risk reigniting the backlash we had in the past,” Mr. Lansky said.
In many ways, Kaiser has been ahead of the curve on health care for decades. Started by a surgeon running a tiny hospital near Desert Center, Calif., to serve construction workers, Kaiser became an H.M.O. with its own doctors and hospital in the mid-1940s and expanded beyond California over the next 50 years. But, as H.M.O.’s fell out of favor, it was forced to leave states like New York, Connecticut and Texas.
But Kaiser persevered, and its membership, which peaked in 1998, is now about the same as its previous high of 9.1 million, about three-quarters of whom are in California. It still operates in a half-dozen states from Maryland to Hawaii and is looking to expand in the Mid-Atlantic region, where membership had been dropping.
The organization, with some $50 billion in annual revenue, owns 37 hospitals and employs 17,000 doctors, all on salary. And its integrated model is in favor again. Hospitals across the country are buying physician practices or partnering with doctors and health insurers to form accountable care organizations, or A. C.O.’s, as a way of controlling more aspects of patient care. Doctors are also creating so-called medical homes, where patient care is better coordinated.
The days when doctors, hospitals and other providers are paid separately for each procedure will disappear eventually, health experts say. Instead, providers will have financial incentives to encourage them to keep people healthy, including lump sums to care for patients or provide comprehensive care for a specific condition. “All of care is going to move down this path, and it has to,” Mr. Halvorson said. “Medical homes are doing it; the very best A. C.O’s are going to figure out how to do it.”
The move by hospitals to buy physician practices is being viewed cautiously by health experts, who say there are downsides to the creation of large health care systems that may be motivated by the desire to increase their clout in the market, making it easier to fill beds and charge the insurers more for care. “They become these huge local monopolies,” said Dr. Robert Berenson, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute.
But having an integrated system seems essential to the success of Kaiser and a handful of similar, if smaller, organizations, like Intermountain Healthcare in Utah and Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, although some work with doctors whom they do not employ. In California, Kaiser controls nearly every aspect of a patient’s care, from providing the M.R.I. for a diagnosis to filling a prescription at one of its pharmacies to running a hospital where the patient undergoes surgery.
“We have all the pieces,” said Philip Fasano, Kaiser’s chief information officer. “Anything a patient needs you get in the four walls of our offices,” he said. As a result, while Kaiser can point to an analysis done by Aon Hewitt, a benefits consultant, showing that its plans are typically at least 10 percent less expensive than others, especially where they control all the providers, its costs are more like the average in places in Ohio, where it does not have its own hospitals and offer as broad a range of services.
And some patients outside of California, where Kaiser operations are less concentrated, complain about being forced to travel for treatment by Kaiser providers. Arva Priola, a 62-year-old Kaiser patient in Fredericksburg, Va., said her Kaiser doctors “are wonderful,” but that the plan recently started requiring her to get some treatments where they had physical facilities.
To get IV antibiotics after surgery, for example, she recently had to drive an hour and a half to a Kaiser office in Tysons Corner, Va. “Who wants to drive when you’re sick?” she asked. Kaiser says it is adding more services closer to Fredericksburg.
A California state agency recently criticized Kaiser for the long wait times its members had for mental health services and for providing inaccurate information about what services it provides. Kaiser says it has corrected the misinformation and is working to reduce and better track member wait times.
Where Kaiser has a head start that others may have difficulty catching up to is its use of electronic records and technology systems for tracking patient care.
When Dr. Jennifer Slovis, a Kaiser internist in Oakland, recently saw a patient, she was able to spot that the patient had an abnormal blood test several years ago. By reading through the patient’s medical history, she determined he was now overdue for an M.R.I. to check the status of a growth in his brain. She was able to e-mail his endocrinologist and schedule the necessary tests without the patient having to make an appointment with the specialist or her having to make her own diagnosis. “It saved a lot of starting over,” she said.
In the last five or so years, Kaiser has also been using the information to identify those doctors or clinics that excel in certain areas, as well as those in need of improvement. The organization has also used the records to change how it delivers care, identifying patients at risk for developing bed sores in the hospital and then sending electronic alerts every two hours to remind the nurses to turn the patients. The percentage of patients with serious pressure ulcers, or bed sores, dropped to well under 1 percent from 3.5 percent.
“The tool is an enabler to give information to people who give a damn,” said Dr. Jack Cochran, the executive who represents Kaiser’s physicians through the Permanente Federation.
Mr. Halvorson, the Kaiser chief, who plans to retire at the end of this year, says the organization is providing evidence to other health systems that re-engineering works. “All of that adds up to better care and cheaper care,” he said.

The idea was to keep them out of the hospital, and that effort — combined with dozens more like it — is starting to make a difference: across the city, doctors are providing less, but not worse, health care.
For most health care providers, that would be cause for alarm. But not for Advocate Health Care, based in Oak Brook, Ill., a pioneer in an approach known as “accountable care” that offers financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to cut costs rather than funnel patients through an ever-greater volume of costly medical services. Under the agreement, hospital admissions are down 6 percent. Days spent in the hospital are down nearly 9 percent. The average length of a stay has declined, and many other measures show doctors providing less care, too.
This approach is one small part of a growing effort by providers to hold down costs without restricting needed care. Nationwide, health care spending has grown over the last three years at the slowest rate since the federal government started keeping data more than 50 years ago. While the bulk of that is related to the poor economy, changes among insurers and health care providers have contributed as well. If the trend continues, even at a reduced pace, it could help alleviate Washington’s long-term deficit problems and ease the strain on family budgets.
“The part that’s not driven by the economy, that’s the part we can theoretically control,” said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. “If we can shave even a small percentage off of it, it has a huge impact on public programs, a huge impact on premiums, a huge impact on employers.”
But even as more health systems seek to replicate Advocate’s early success, its experience shows just how hard it may be to expand the approach and keep medical costs from resuming their relentless rise.
“It’s hard to imagine that you could start from scratch and do this and be successful in three years,” said Dr. Lee Sacks, Advocate’s chief medical officer, noting that other systems may find it far harder to flip the traditional fee-for-services system on its head. “We had a running head-start going back to 1995.”
Nonetheless, the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s health care law, has helped encourage a shift to Advocate’s payment model. Such agreements were merely a theory four years ago. But an estimated 428 accountable-care organizations now cover four million Medicare enrollees and millions more people with private insurance.
Under Advocate’s deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield, certain patients are assigned to the accountable care framework — about 380,000 — and their health costs are projected. If Advocate achieves savings below that amount while meeting explicit quality targets, it splits the money with the insurer. If not, its revenue is at risk.
In some ways, accountable care resembles earlier efforts to control medical spending, including the health maintenance organizations that proliferated in the 1980s but fell out of favor, in part because they severely limited patients’ choices. But accountable care differs by giving doctors and hospitals a direct financial stake in saving money and a reason to invest in various programs of preventive care rather than relying exclusively on the fees they would normally earn from providing services.
“There’s an enormous amount at stake in getting these reforms to work,” said Alan Krueger, the chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.
To help control costs, Advocate has hired scores of workers to coordinate care and keep an eye on the highest-cost patients, like those who are obese or have diabetes. It started providing doctors’ offices with report cards on their performance. Dozens of quality-control measures cover items as varied as blood pressure, rehospitalizations for asthma attacks or the use of expensive imaging machines.
On a blustery spring morning, those changes were visible in Advocate care centers across the metropolitan area. Sumera Khan, a clinical pharmacy specialist, popped into the hospital room of Noraine Scarpelli, an elderly woman with congestive heart failure, to check her prescription drug levels, an additional level of scrutiny that can help prevent complications. In another building, Dr. Karen O’Mara flicked between eight computer screens, peering at intensive care patients miles away, ready to alert a doctor if they looked in distress.
Advocate, a faith-based nonprofit, has an advantage over other health systems just jumping into what is more broadly known as “value-based care.” In the late 1990s, well before it forged its contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Advocate began taking steps to control costs and improve quality. A decade ago it adopted a “clinical integration” program, requiring doctors to work together on patients in common. It was also a pioneer in the use of electronic health records.
“A lot of these early adopters were systems that were already putting things in place,” said Ani Turner of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the Altarum Institute, a national health care research group based in Ann Arbor, Mich. “In a way, the contracts are rewarding behaviors they were already pursuing.”
So far, Advocate has achieved a small but significant savings of about 2 percent below projected costs, Blue Cross Blue Shield said, but it is not clear whether it can continue to make progress. Already, some Advocate hospital chiefs have expressed fears over losing revenue and warned about the threat to their financial performance. Doctors fret that their incomes may suffer. “We’re doing it because it’s the right thing to do for patients,” said Dr. Stuck, the Advocate family physician. “We’re not making more money.”
At the same time, Advocate and Blue Cross Blue Shield have no way to prevent patients that fall under the accountable-care agreement from seeing doctors outside Advocate’s network. That means patients might see doctors without an incentive to cut costs as well as deliver excellent care, eroding or even erasing the cost savings the agreement achieves.
“You’re trying to overlay a payment design onto a benefit model that allows a patient to go anywhere he wants,” said Steve Hamman of Blue Cross Blue Shield, noting that patients can undermine the advantages of the new approach if they ignore the advice or insist on unnecessary tests and procedures. “We can talk all we want about provider accountability and how important that is. But there is a measure of patient accountability that is critical as well.”
For all the obstacles, most health economists agree that accountable care organizations are one of the most promising recent developments in the giant industry. Kaufman Hall, a consulting firm that studied Advocate’s results, said its research showed that the older and the bigger a value-based care system, the more capable it proved at controlling costs — and the more it was able to influence the larger community of health care providers.
“Doctors who practice with Advocate often also practice at other hospitals,” said Mark Grube, Kaufman Hall’s managing director. “What is occurring is that even when they are practicing at hospitals that are not under value-based contracts, they’ve changed how they practice. We’re seeing declines in utilization there, too.”
That ultimately might be what helps the accountable care model catch on and hold down spending in the longer term.
“You can see a synergy with all these initiatives,” said Ms. Turner of the Altarum Institute. “There are a lot of forces out there trying to move things in the same direction.”

The measure allowing such data collection is one of a handful that the Texas Medical Association is pushing this legislative session to help modernize medical practices. The association is also backing bills that would standardize preauthorization forms used by health plans for prescription drugs and health care services.
“A lot of these things are easy fixes,” said Dr. Michael Speer, president of the Texas Medical Association. “It’s just a matter of getting enough people to come together and agree that it’s the right fix.” (The Texas Medical Association is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) The association, which represents more than 47,000 physicians and medical students, asserts that time and money are wasted on bureaucracy, and that each physician spends nearly $83,000 a year on administrative costs. It donated more than $1.3 million to state candidates in 2011 and 2012.
Medical practitioners must follow myriad procedures for billing private and public health plans. Many hire additional staff members to handle the paperwork, and simple errors can obstruct payment.
“It’s an extremely inefficient business model,” said Dr. Bernard Swift Jr., chief executive of Texas MedClinic, a network of urgent-care facilities.
Dr. Swift said Senate Bill 166, which is awaiting the governor’s signature, would eliminate repetitive paperwork by allowing licensed health care providers to collect accurate patient information from a driver’s license. Now, only hospitals in Texas are authorized to do so.
Senate Bills 644 and 1216, which have been approved by the Senate and referred to a House committee, would standardize the preauthorization forms required for prescription drugs and health services.
If health plans used the same or similar forms, it “could make a dramatic difference in the amount of manpower hours” spent on paperwork, said Representative John Zerwas, a Republican from Simonton. Dr. Zerwas, who is also an anesthesiologist, sponsored S.B. 644.
Although insurance industry representatives originally opposed the preauthorization form bills, they support the revised versions of the legislation that would set up expert advisory councils at the Texas Department of Insurance to ensure that the state’s standardized forms match federal standards and allow for electronic transmission of the records.
“Let the experts determine form and format,” said David Gonzales, executive director of the Texas Association of Health Plans. In health care, “standards at the national level are the preference. You don’t want 50 different state approaches.” (The Texas Association of Health Plans is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)
As physicians adapt their practices to the digital era, collecting accurate patient data — like that from a driver’s license — will help improve payment systems, ensure patient safety and prevent insurance fraud, said Nora Belcher, executive director of the Texas e-Health Alliance, an association of health technology stakeholders.
“What’s really best for the patient is complete data at the point of care,” Ms. Belcher said.

Dr. Ellen Hodges only wishes it could be so easy.
She oversees health care for a population of 28,000, mostly Alaska Natives, here in the state’s far west end, spread out over an area the size of Oregon that has almost no roads. People can travel by boat or snow machine at certain times of the year, but not right now: the Kuskokwim River, which wends through Bethel to the Bering Sea, is choked with unstable melting ice in late May, magnifying the isolation that defines everything in what may be America’s emptiest corner.
“If you have a road, you’re not remote,” Dr. Hodges said.
The complex machinery of health care is being reimagined everywhere in the nation through the combined prism of new regulations and shifting economics, even here on the continent’s frosted fringe.
The grandly named Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, for example, where Dr. Hodges is chief of staff, is scrambling this spring to install a new electronic medical records system. That is a hallmark of the federal health care overhaul, compounded out here by the fact that computers run by generators in far-flung villages are subject to brownouts and fuel shortages.
Cost controls are also the way of the medical frontier no matter where you look. In other places, such constraints may be driven by insurance companies; here, by sequester-driven budget cuts to the federal Indian Health Service. The agency is the 50-bed hospital’s main support in treating the tribes and villagers who have lived for thousands of years in the boggy crescent of lowlands where the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers carve their paths to the sea.
The 56 tribes in the region voted in the mid-1990s to bundle their health care money from the federal government to finance the hospital. Grants supplement the work.
But the one thing that shapes every care decision, from the routine to the catastrophic, is the map. Triage in medical decisions, logistics and money is all filtered through an equation of time and distance on a vast and mostly untracked land.
Is air transport justified for medical reasons? Too slow to make a difference? Too dangerous in bad weather to attempt? What should a health worker on the ground — in most villages a local resident trained by the hospital — be told to do, or not do?
“There are judgment calls that you never have to make in the lower 48,” said Dr. David Bielak, 31, a family medicine practitioner who started coming here last fall in temporary stints from his home near San Jose, Calif.
And many of those decisions, often based on telephone descriptions from a villager, can be weighty. None of the more than four dozen communities served by the hospital have a doctor in residence.
“It’s the middle of the night, and you get a call from a clinic way up in the middle of nowhere where something very, very strange has happened,” Dr. Bielak said. “A lot of it is dark: a lot of alcoholism, suicidal ideation, a lot of abuse.”
A lack of running water and sewer systems in many villages in turn compounds the struggle to make, or keep, people well in a place long marked by poverty and isolation.
Take a glimpse, for example, into Alexandria Tikiun’s world: At age 25, with four children at home to care for, she is a community health aide, the closest thing to an M.D. in her village, Atmautluak, population about 400.
The aide system itself is uniquely Alaskan. It was developed in the 1950s, during an outbreak of tuberculosis, when the first health aides were trained to dispense medicine. Now, in sessions here at the hospital, Ms. Tikiun and 150 other aides, mostly women, learn medical skills that include trauma response, pregnancy testing and vaccination, all based on a book that they call their bible, which walks them through a kind of algorithm of step-by-step questions leading to treatment protocols.
On tougher cases, Ms. Tikiun consults by telephone with a doctor in Bethel. For medical checkups, she can use a telemedicine machine that allows, say, a child’s ear-exam results to be sent electronically from the village clinic to a specialist in Anchorage or elsewhere. X-rays are read by radiologists in Ohio.
But life in the Alaskan bush, with all its attendant risks and mayhem, is never far away. Ms. Tikiun said she once spent two hours on the floor of a pickup truck, ministering to an accident victim with multiple fractures and lacerations as her driver raced down the frozen Kuskokwim River ice road, bound for Bethel’s nine-bed emergency room.
The added stress of the work, said another village aide, Randall Gamball, is social. In a tiny village, every patient is without exception also an acquaintance or a relative.
“It’s really tough to work on someone you know,” Mr. Gamball said.
The hospital’s flight paramedics, meanwhile, have to be ready with unpredictable medical emergencies and a sometimes radically ferocious climate at the same time. Whiteout conditions and temperatures 40 degrees below zero are not uncommon in winter.
Mark Stevens, a paramedic originally from eastern Washington, described one particularly memorable rescue: His team — two paramedics and a pilot — landed their propeller plane on a village airstrip, but then freezing fog closed in, coating everything with thick, heavy ice.
It took three hours of frantic scraping — two crew members at the plane, the other with the patient — before they could head back.
Every flight must be a consensus, Mr. Stevens said, and any member of the three-person team can veto the plan if conditions seem unsafe. “It’s three to go, one to say no,” he said.
Doctors and nurses are also mostly from the lower 48, doing stints here of a week or a month. Sometimes, being thrown together in an isolated place has unexpected benefits. Dena Gray and Gary Holmes, both registered nurses — he’s from Alabama, she’s from Oklahoma — met at the hospital. Last month, they flew to Las Vegas and married.
Others fall in love with the patients, or the tundra, or some combination. Dr. Hodges, 38, came to Bethel on a two-year contract, vowing to leave at the first possible opportunity. That was 10 years ago.

A dozen clinic employees, who spend intense, chaotic days treating an unending stream of Louisville’s poor and uninsured, stared stonily at handouts he had brought as he made his pitch.
The visitor was Danny DuBosque, a “coach” hired to help the nonprofit clinic adapt to the demands of the federal health care overhaul. He had come to discuss a new appointment system, one that will let patients see a doctor or nurse within a few days of calling, instead of weeks or months.
“It’s a huge satisfier,” he declared — management-speak that fell flat with Dr. Michelle Elisburg, a pediatrician who was scheduled to see 26 patients that day.
“It puts me on edge,” said Dr. Elisburg, who has spent her career treating the poor. “Under this model, it’s first come first served, whoever calls fastest. But that’s not necessarily the patient who really needs to be seen.”
Mr. DuBosque, 35, raised his arms, a plea for patience. “We’re going to take the next few years going through and untangling all these issues,” he said before hurrying to another meeting.
“It’s frightening,” Dr. Elisburg, 42, murmured as Mr. DuBosque left.
The debate that morning was just one expression of the tensions rippling through medical offices around the country in the countdown to January, when the Affordable Care Act will require most Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. For doctors and their staffs, this is a period of fevered preparation for the far-reaching changes that are soon to come as the law moves out of the realm of political jousting and into the real world.
To follow how the historic law is playing out, The New York Times will look periodically at its impact in Louisville, a city of 600,000 that embodies both the triumphs and the shortcomings of the medical system in the United States.
The nation’s first hand transplant was performed here, as was the world’s first implant of a self-contained artificial heart. One of the nation’s largest insurers, Humana, is based here, and the city’s downtown area alone has four hospitals and a medical school. Health care increasingly fuels the local economy, accounting for many of the largest employers and a growing number of start-ups.
Yet for all the resources and expertise, the health outcomes in Kentucky remain “horrendous,” as Gov. Steven L. Beshear, a Democrat, put it recently. The state has some of the nation’s highest rates of smoking, obesity and deaths due to cancer and diabetes. At this point, the only sure thing about putting the law’s many pieces in place here is that it will not be easy.
The potential benefits are huge. Some 90,000 people could get medical coverage in this city alone. It could create thousands of jobs in Kentucky and, if its aspirations are realized, provide better care at lower cost. Yet the law still provokes suspicion and confusion, among both health care providers and the uninsured population it is meant to help.
Community clinics like the one Mr. DuBosque was visiting, one of seven in a network here called Family Health Centers, are at the front lines of the change. They expect that their patient load could double, even as they struggle to recruit doctors and other staff members. They serve people who, because of poverty or entrenched habits, often have a hard time staying healthy and tend to put off preventive care. Now these clinics are anticipating competition from private providers who may see newly insured patients — no matter how poor — as opportunities for profit. So they are working on improving the patient experience and their own efficiency.
The legislation allots $11 billion over five years to improve and expand community clinics across the nation. Family Health Centers is getting $5.4 million to renovate a clinic for the homeless and move a downtown clinic to a much bigger building, adding dental and X-ray departments and a pharmacy. The organization hopes to eventually serve 10,000 additional patients at that site alone, if it can hire enough doctors and nurses to treat them. Meanwhile, it is using federal stimulus money to convert 60,000 paper charts to electronic medical records, and trying to improve patient access with the new scheduling system and other changes.
“We have to change from being the provider of last resort to the first choice for the community we serve,” said Bill Wagner, the longtime executive director of Family Health Centers. “Everything we do needs to say, ‘You’re valuable to us.’ ”
Soft of voice and low-key, Mr. Wagner, 60, nonetheless acknowledges that the stakes for Family Health Centers are unnervingly high. He gets to work at 6:30 a.m. these days, relies on a steady stream of caffeine and clears his head with weekend motorcycle rides.
“We couldn’t have more balls in the air right now,” he said.
Patients and Problems
The West End of Louisville is a patchwork of poor neighborhoods, where asthma, high blood pressure and other chronic conditions are stubbornly common. In Portland, a neighborhood of one-way streets and faded shotgun homes, the biggest Family Health Centers clinic provides basic care to some 16,000 patients per year, regardless of ability to pay.
Here, Alaina Brohm, a brisk nurse practitioner, treats a diverse and challenging population: the unemployed, the chronically depressed, the obese, patients with advanced diabetes and feeble hearts. Ms. Brohm, 30, could be making more money at the retail clinics popping up in drugstores and supermarkets, diagnosing strep throats and bladder infections. Maybe someday she will. But for now, she wants a bigger challenge.
“I knew I would see it all here — a lot of chronic conditions, the worst of the worst,” she said. “I know a little bit about everything.”
Few in Louisville may feel the effects of the new health care law as tangibly as the uninsured patients who churn through Ms. Brohm’s cramped exam rooms — and how they will respond to the law is one of the crucial questions that will determine whether it succeeds. For now, many seem either wary of it or uninformed.
Marchelle Edwards, 55, had been absent from the clinic for more than a year when she arrived there one Monday in May. She had a painful infection in her foot, linked to uncontrolled diabetes. She had stopped taking medicine to control her blood sugar after her prescription ran out months earlier. She also had a bladder infection and a thyroid condition that was making her hoarse. Her daughter Tammy, who had driven her to the clinic, reported that she was subsisting on Pepsi and junk food and feeling tired all the time.
Ms. Edwards seemed to be a walking example of the potential benefits of the same-day appointment system that Mr. DuBosque had been pitching. “I just couldn’t get an appointment in here,” she said, alluding to the long wait time and why she had not bothered trying.
“Even if you made an appointment and it was two months out,” Ms. Brohm softly chided, “it would be a lot sooner than waiting a year.”
The last time Ms. Brohm had seen Ms. Edwards, in April 2012, she had referred her to a podiatrist affiliated with University Hospital, which provides most of the city’s specialized indigent care. But Ms. Edwards, a former food service worker, said she had stopped seeing the podiatrist because he charged $35 per visit.
“I stay at home and I hurt,” she said.
Ms. Brohm started her back on two medicines: one to regulate her blood sugar, and another to help with pain in her feet, a result of nerve damage from the diabetes. One would be free through a pharmacy discount program for the poor; the other would be $6 a month, an expense Ms. Edwards said was prohibitive.
“There’s only so much I can do with your toes, O.K., without surgery,” Ms. Brohm told her. “You’re going to need another referral to a podiatrist, another appointment with a financial counselor. Let me grab you a list.”
She left the room to get one, but Ms. Edwards stalked out, scowling, before she could return. Her daughter shook her head.
“Not having insurance,” Tammy Edwards said, “not being able to get the treatments and stuff that she really needs, it’s depressing for her.”
Ms. Edwards will almost certainly qualify for Medicaid under an expansion next year, which means she would pay nothing or a few dollars for most drugs and medical care, with a maximum of $450 a year.
Yet Ms. Brohm wonders whether Ms. Edwards will pursue the care she needs even if she gets Medicaid. “She’s scared of health care,” Ms. Brohm said after the appointment. “She’s one of the ones that’s more in denial. I guess it’s her defense mechanism: ‘If I don’t find out, then I won’t know.’ ”
Ms. Edwards’s case raises a crucial question about the health care law: Will insurance necessarily make unhealthy people healthier?
David Elson, 59, who has congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, skipped an appointment at the clinic in April because he could not afford the fee. He earns enough to pay the highest fee on the clinic’s sliding scale: $65 per visit, he said, and more if he needs blood work. He came one recent evening for an urgent visit, laboring to breathe.
Mr. Elson, who has his own business installing alarm systems, used to pay $125 a month for health insurance, he said. But then he developed diabetes, and his premium soared to more than $500 a month. He dropped the policy years ago.
His nurse practitioner, Susan Elrod, quickly determined that he had fluid in his lungs. Ashen and slumped, he had gained 50 pounds in two months — all water weight, she said — because his weakened heart had not been pumping efficiently enough. He now weighed 309 pounds, and his legs had swelled so much that large lesions had opened on them, fluid seeping out.
“We’re going to have to send you to the emergency room,” Ms. Elrod told him. “Do you feel strong enough to drive, or would you like me to call an ambulance?”
Mr. Elson grimaced, realizing he now faced a far greater expense than what he had saved by skipping his last appointment. He was already struggling to pay for his insulin — $240 a month, he said — and other drugs, which filled a plastic bag he had brought with him.
“I can’t afford to go,” he said, looking blank, after Ms. Elrod had left the room.
He went nonetheless, but not until the next morning, when a neighbor could drive him.
Mr. Elson said he earned about $24,000 a year, too much to qualify for Medicaid even under the expansion. It will cover people with incomes up to $15,856 for a household of one.
But Mr. Elson could still get federal subsidies starting next year to help him buy private coverage through the insurance marketplace, or exchange, that Kentucky is creating under the law. People with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty level — about $46,000 for an individual — will be eligible for such subsidies if they buy coverage through an exchange. But Mr. Elson said he was certain the cost would still be too high.
“I don’t see it helping anybody,” he said, “just making everybody get insurance.”
In fact, Mr. Elson might pay about $130 a month for coverage if he signed up for a medium-cost plan, according to an estimate by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research group. He would qualify for a subsidy that would cover 80 percent of his premium costs. The law will also prohibit insurance companies from turning him away or charging him more because he is sick.
Even Ms. Brohm, the nurse practitioner, is suspicious of the law and confused about the changes it will bring. For one thing, she worries that poor people who become eligible for Medicaid under the expansion will be required to pay a part of their medical costs.
“If it does help out with the expensive stuff, that will be very exciting,” she said. “But my concern is if they have to pay anything, will things still be done? Sometimes even a small percentage is too much for people.”
The law’s divisiveness, meanwhile, makes her uncomfortable. She knows of a restaurant chain that may be sold, she said, because the owner cannot afford to provide insurance for his employees, as the law will soon require.
“If it becomes something a lot of people argue about,” she said, “that frightens me.”
Changes on the Way
At a meeting of the Family Health Centers medical staff in May, Ms. Brohm and her colleagues listened as Dr. Peter Thurman, the medical director, delivered a pep talk of sorts. He was pressing them to complete a day’s worth of online courses about the electronic records system that the clinics were poised to adopt. More training would come later in the year.
“It’s self-preservation, in my opinion,” Dr. Thurman said.
The topic shifted to the new appointment system, which only one of the clinics, known as Fairdale, had adopted so far. The early news was good: the average no-show rate had dropped from 21 percent in March to 10.5 percent in May.
“This thing is working,” Dr. Thurman proclaimed, and went on to credit Mr. DuBosque. “Danny’s been a godsend for us, I’ll just be honest with you.”
Later that day, Mr. DuBosque drove to the Fairdale clinic on the south side of Louisville, to get some firsthand feedback. The staff had more good news: fewer patients were turning to private urgent-care centers, a growing source of competition for Family Health Centers.
“They’re acting shocked: ‘What, we can get in today?’ ” said Saundra Kay Webb, a receptionist.
Technically, Mr. DuBosque’s job is to help Family Health Centers get certified as a “patient-centered medical home.” Under that model, teams of providers take a highly organized approach to patient care, with a focus on customer service. Better access is a central goal, which is why Family Health Centers is cutting its wait time for appointments.
Electronic medical records are also essential to the medical home model, partly to reduce what Mr. DuBosque called “the sheer work of keeping tabs on things with paper charts.”
Among other things, he is learning that change sometimes comes more slowly in community clinics than in the fiercely competitive hospital sector, where he used to work. For example, Mr. DuBosque thinks it would be smart to start and end the workday later at Family Health Centers, because patients are reluctant to show up for early-morning appointments. But the idea is not catching fire.
“There’s a whole host of things we’re going to have to fight through with that,” he said. “We have a lot of staff with some established routines and schedules. But I think it’s a no-brainer.”
Doctors working full time at Family Health Centers earn about $127,000 a year, far less than many of their counterparts in private practice. In the last year alone, the clinics lost five doctors, including one who moved, one who retired and one who took a higher-paying job at a hospital. Nurse practitioners are filling the void. They now make up 60 percent of the medical staff at the seven clinics, and their role will continue to grow.
But they, too, are in high demand, and their salary at Family Health Centers, about $67,000 a year for a full-time position, comes up short compared with the private sector.
If Family Health Centers sees enough new revenue, raising salaries will be a top priority. But as with so much of the Affordable Care Act, there are still far more questions than answers.
“Will it allow a community health center to be competitive on M.D.’s against the hospitals?” Dr. Thurman asked. “I just don’t know.”
Financial Considerations
One afternoon last month, Mr. Wagner, the director of Family Health Centers, canceled his appointments and hurried to the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort, about an hour away. Governor Beshear was announcing that he would expand Medicaid in the state, a measure called for under the health care law but one that many states are opting out of. By the governor’s estimate, it would allow up to 308,000 additional Kentuckians into the program, almost half of the state’s uninsured population.
Mr. Wagner was eager to bear witness to an announcement that he deemed historic, the culmination of a goal he has spent his career trying to achieve. The Medicaid expansion could also solve Mr. Wagner’s budget problem. Family Health Centers is facing a deficit of about $3 million in its overall annual budget of $30 million, largely because so many of its 42,000 patients, 54 percent, are uninsured.
“Right now we’re living off our reserve fund, and that can only last so long,” Mr. Wagner said.
Then it was back to his office in Louisville to keep planning. That day he learned that community clinics around the country would receive $150 million to help sign up people for insurance. Family Health Centers anticipates getting about $300,000, which it will use to get the word out starting this summer. Under the law, people can start signing up in October for coverage that starts in January.
“We will undoubtedly be hiring staff who will sit in the lobbies with patients — with laptops, with tablets — to provide assistance in enrolling online,” Mr. Wagner said.
October will be a critical month at Family Health Centers. The insurance sign-up period will begin just as construction on the new downtown clinic gets under way. At the same time, the huge Portland clinic will go live with the electronic medical records, and it will have just adopted the new appointment system.
Ms. Brohm, the nurse practitioner, will be married by then, returning from her honeymoon to what may feel like a strange new world. Ms. Elrod, her colleague, will have cut her hours at Family Health Centers and started working in the relative calm of a private doctor’s office. Short of a miracle, neither Ms. Edwards nor Mr. Elson, their chronically ill patients, will have health insurance yet. But if the outreach campaign succeeds, they will have learned of their options and may be poised to sign up.
The day after Mr. Elson was admitted to the hospital, Ms. Elrod called to check on him. His breathing had improved, and the hospital had prescribed a different diuretic to help him excrete water. He had lost 10 pounds so far and would lose 20 more by the end of his five-day stay. She told him to follow up at the clinic after his release.
“Get on my schedule for Tuesday night, O.K.?” she said, then paused for his response. “O.K., if you have the money. I understand, Mr. Elson. O.K. Bye.”

In the United States, 93 percent of hospitals are now using at least some electronic medical records and 2.2 percent have given up paper records completely, according to the consulting firm HIMSS Analytics.
The federal government has been pushing for electronic medical records for a decade, arguing that they will improve health care and bring down costs. That is still a matter of debate. Critics charge that the system is hobbled by poorly designed software and that some hospitals are using electronic medical records to bill more for the same services.
But a new study suggests that electronic medical records may have another, entirely different use: as a Rosetta Stone for our DNA. Researchers are using them to trace links between genes and disease.
It has been 13 years since scientists first published the rough draft of the human genome and yet they are still just beginning to work out how our DNA influences our health. Most insights in recent years have come from so-called genome-wide association studies.
To run such a study, scientists find a lot of people with the same condition — diabetes, for example, or Alzheimer’s disease. Then they take samples of DNA from the subjects and search them for mutations that are unusually common in people with the disease compared with people without it.
Since 2005, scientists have carried out more than 1,500 genome-wide association studies, discovering thousands of links between gene variants and various conditions. But these studies have only put a dent in the genome’s mysterious complexity.
Many of the gene variants they have uncovered have only a tiny influence on the risk of getting a particular disease. And when scientists have replicated genome-wide association studies, some links between genes and diseases have faded away.
A study published this week in Nature Biotechnology opens up a new way to search for these links: by turning genome-wide associations on their head.
In the new approach — called phenome-wide association studies — scientists start with a gene variant and then search among thousands of conditions for a match.
To find those matches, scientists comb through electronic medical records.
The new study was carried out by scientists from a consortium of medical research institutions. Known as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network — eMERGE for short — it was founded in 2007 and includes institutions like the Mayo Clinic and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
The eMERGE network has developed software to extract and analyze information from their electronic medical records. Those records rarely include genetic information, but the researchers have also been setting aside blood samples from patients for genetic studies. After making the two sets of information anonymous, the researchers combined them into a single database.
The eMERGE team has now taken the database out for a test run. Looking at previously published genome-wide association studies, they identified 77 gene variants with strongly supported links to diseases. The scientists then tried to replicate the results.
To do so, they started with the gene variants and looked through the electronic medical records of their patients for any unusually common conditions. “We have everything they come to the doctor for,” said Dr. Joshua C. Denny, a biomedical informatics researcher at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a co-author of the new study.
In 51 out of 77 cases, Dr. Denny and his colleagues ended up with the same link. With 1,358 different conditions to choose from in the electronic medical records, it was practically impossible for them to do so well simply by chance.
“It’s a phenomenal proof of concept,” said Robert C. Green, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School. The new study has persuaded him that electronic medical records are a reliable source of scientific information — even though they weren’t originally designed with such research in mind. “Warts and all, we can use them to do science,” Dr. Green said.
The eMERGE team then searched for new links of their own. They surveyed 3,144 gene variants identified in past genome-wide association studies to see if they also influenced any other diseases. They discovered 63 new links to diseases, ranging from skin cancer to anemia.
This finding also has exciting potential. Scientists have long known that a single gene can have a variety of effects on our health. That is because genes are biological multitaskers, helping carry out different functions in the body.
But genome-wide association studies — which are designed to examine a single condition — have done a poor job of uncovering these effects. Electronic health records, the new study suggests, have the power to reveal them.
Such studies could help link seemingly unrelated symptoms, Dr. Denny suggested. They could also point to potentially harmful side effects of a drug. On the other hand, they could also guide research into new uses for drugs. “If you have a drug that targets a certain gene, you can understand what range of diseases you can use that drug to treat,” said Dr. Denny.
The eMERGE database now has information on about 51,000 patients and the researchers are currently expanding their phenome-wide association studies accordingly. Daniel MacArthur, a geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital who was not involved in the new study, predicted that larger databases of electronic health records will allow scientists to find links between diseases and rare gene variants that are so far impossible to detect. “This is exciting stuff,” he said.
Even larger studies are on the horizon. The Department of Veterans Affairs, for example, has set up the Million Veteran Program, which will combine electronic medical records and a DNA database from volunteers. They now have 240,000 veterans enrolled.
“Unfortunately,” said Dr. MacArthur, “applying this on a larger scale in the U.S. is complicated by the dire state of electronic medical records.”

Developments
Pandemics: Somber Recount
The H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009 claimed far more victims than previously thought, according to a new study from the World Health Organization. About 203,000 people worldwide died from flu and respiratory problems, far higher than the 18,449 laboratory-confirmed cases that the W.H.O. stood by as its official count in 2009. Add in deaths from heart failure and other secondary consequences of the flu, the study said, and the toll rises to about 400,000.
The new total closely matches the conclusions of a 2012 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The W.H.O. was initially reluctant to estimate fatality rates.
Archaeology: Birthday Surprise
Underneath a temple in Nepal thought to be the birthplace of Buddha, architects uncovered a timber shrine erected as early as the sixth century B.C. Though little is known of Buddha’s life, previous evidence favored a birth date no earlier than the third century B.C. If the new discovery truly was a Buddhist shrine, or even the site of Buddha’s birth, it could push those estimates back centuries.
Writing in the journal Antiquity, the researchers called their find “the first archaeological evidence regarding the date of the life of Buddha.”
Prevention: A Vaccine Scorecard
Childhood vaccines have prevented more than 100 million cases of serious contagious disease in the United States since 1924, according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In an impressive example of what can be accomplished by building and analyzing vast data sets, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh tracked public reports of 56 diseases going back to the 19th century. They determined the number of prevented diseases by tracking the decrease in disease reports after vaccines became available.
The researchers stopped short of estimating how many deaths were prevented, though one of the authors said it was probably three to four million.
Medicine: Big Data in Health Records 
Speaking of vast data sets, some scientists have found a new use for electronic medical records: searching through thousands at a time to find links between diseases and genes. In a reverse approach to genome-wide association studies, in which researchers take DNA samples from people with the same disease and search them for similar gene mutations, scientists have begun searching medical records for specific gene mutations and then determining whether the carriers share any diseases.
These health records were not designed with research in mind, but the results so far are promising. “Warts and all, we can use them to do science,” said Robert C. Green, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School.
Coming Up
Astronomy: A Comet’s Last Act
It’s not looking good, but satellites and stargazers will watch the sky this week to see if anything remains of Comet ISON. The so-called comet of the century appeared to vaporize last Thursday after passing within a million miles of the sun. Hours later, it reappeared, only to fade again over the weekend. The light show long expected this week probably will not happen, scientists said, but a silver lining has emerged: By tearing apart before our eyes, ISON could provide better information about its composition and hints of how the planets formed than if it had remained intact.

But despite Mr. Obama’s promises in the last two months to “leap into the 21st century,” there is little evidence that the administration is moving quickly to pursue an overhaul of the current system in the coming year.
Outside experts, members of Congress, technology executives and former government officials say the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s website is the nearly inevitable result of a procurement process that stifles innovation and wastes taxpayer dollars. The Air Force last year scrapped a $1 billion supply management system. Officials abandoned a new F.B.I. system after spending $170 million on it. And a $438 million air traffic control systems update, a critical part of a $45 billion nationwide upgrade that is years behind schedule, is expected to go at least $270 million over budget.
Longstanding laws intended to prevent corruption and conflict of interest often saddle agencies with vendors selected by distant committees and contracts that stretch for years, even as technology changes rapidly. The rules frequently leave the government officials in charge of a project with little choice over their suppliers, little control over the project’s execution and almost no authority to terminate a contract that is failing.
“It may make sense if you are buying pencils or cleaning services,” said David Blumenthal, who during Mr. Obama’s first term led a federal office to promote the adoption of electronic health records. But it does not work “when you have these kinds of incredibly complex, data-driven, nationally important, performance-based procurements.”
The Standish Group, an information technology firm, deemed just 4.6 percent of large-scale government contracting projects executed in the past decade to be successful. More than half were “challenged,” and about 40 percent simply “failed.”
Multinational companies with large legal teams are often successful at winning years-long government contracts. But officials say technology innovation — particularly on web-based projects like the health care site — is often found in smaller firms, like many in Silicon Valley, that lack the size and the know-how to navigate the costly procurement maze.
“It’s a punishing and punitive environment to work in,” said Stan Z. Soloway, the chief executive of the Professional Services Council, a trade group, and a former Clinton administration official.
Officials said the administration was conducting a “review of options” for improving the government’s use of technology and was beginning to discuss the issue with stakeholders inside and outside government. But they declined to say whether Mr. Obama would call for changes in how Washington delivers technology projects during his State of the Union address early next year and whether the White House had any specific plan to make good on the president’s oft-stated interest in tackling the thorny, bureaucratic issue.
“This administration has made considerable progress in reforming federal I.T. management practices,” said Steven Posner, a spokesman for the White House budget office, citing new open-data and cloud-computing initiatives. “As the president made clear, significant challenges remain in the area of federal I.T., and we need to continue improving the way we deliver technology.”
In Mr. Obama’s first term, the administration pushed agencies to move away from expensive, dedicated hardware by adopting more flexible and cheaper Internet-based services when possible. Officials also began requiring agencies to replace proprietary data with modern open formats that can be easily understood by the public and the private sector.
But lawmakers and others said the Obama administration was doing too little to fix the fundamental problems, and they predicted that the issue would ultimately fall to Mr. Obama’s successor.
Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said the budget office, formally known as the Office of Management and Budget, refused to back bipartisan legislation that would consolidate responsibility for technology projects in a single person at each agency and increase the transparency of government spending on technology.
“O.M.B. takes the position, as it usually does, that we don’t need legislation to address these issues,” said Mr. Connolly, who represents a Washington suburb with hundreds of federal technology contractors. “O.M.B. was really our biggest stumbling block. It was maddening.”
Officials denied Mr. Connolly’s charge, saying the administration is open to legislation but has “some concerns” with the bill in the House because it does not apply to the Pentagon. A Senate version of Mr. Connolly’s legislation in the House was introduced last week by a Democrat and a Republican, but it also centers on the civilian agencies.
Aides pointed to the president’s recent comments about procurement as evidence that the administration is eager to confront the broader problem.
In an interview on MSNBC last month, Mr. Obama bemoaned systemic problems in big technology projects, saying that “our I.T. systems, how we purchase technology in the federal government, is cumbersome, complicated and outdated.”
He reiterated that thought in a news conference on Friday, and he has pledged to “refocus” on the issue during the rest of his term.
Last Tuesday, Mr. Obama met with 15 executives from some of the nation’s largest technology companies, including Tim Cook of Apple and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. Administration officials said the meeting was a first step in confronting the broader issue highlighted by the health care website debacle.
Technology experts across the political spectrum agree there are many problems to fix, from the White House down to the civil servants who administer the half-trillion dollars the government spends a year on procurement contracts, about 15 percent of its total budget.
“It’s not just the contracting rules,” Mr. Soloway said. “It’s the human capital, the way the government buys services, the way the government determines its own requirements, the lack of collaboration within government, the lack of collaboration between the government and the private sector, the outdated systems within government.”
Jim Johnson, the chairman of the Standish Group, said the government often required sweeping, singular contracts for projects that private businesses would complete for in pieces.
“It’s an iterative style,” Mr. Johnson said. “That’s how Google does it. That’s how eBay does it.” Mr. Johnson said the government’s successes tended to come from small, focused projects, which might attract more competitive bids. The success rate for small-scale government contracting projects in the past decade, according to his firm’s analysis, is nearly 55 percent.
The red tape also makes it difficult, if not impossible, for federal agencies to get the technology they need fast enough. “Agency leadership’s need for speed and agility has far outstripped the procurement and finance models,” Richard Spires, a former chief information officer of the Department of Homeland Security, told a congressional panel this year.
In addition, strict rules prevent the government from working closely with contractors once it has hired them. Dr. Blumenthal, the former Obama administration official, said the government system of managing technology projects was broken.
“I think there has to be some middle ground between the current straitjacket and the perfect process that allows any kind of vetting you might want to have,” said Dr. Blumenthal, who was responsible for distributing $30 billion in federal money to doctors and hospitals.
“I didn’t realize how much of a constraint or how disabling it was until I went to the private sector,” added Dr. Blumenthal, now the president of a foundation engaged in research on health and social policy issues.
Administration officials said they agreed with critics that the government needed to move away from an old-fashioned method of technology development that relies on a single, large vendor to develop technology in years-long contracts.
Experts said the HealthCare.gov debacle might ignite movement toward common-sense changes. “There’s certainly momentum,” said Mike Hettinger of the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group.
But Mr. Connolly, the Virginia lawmaker, said he saw little evidence of a new push by the administration, even as he expressed hope Mr. Obama would make the issue more of a priority.
“The president gets it,” Mr. Connolly said. “Now we need to make sure the people who work for him get it.”

Pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in genetic studies in the frenzy after the sequencing of the human genome a decade ago, only to find it did not lead to the expected bonanza of new drugs.
Now, however, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a fast-growing biotechnology company, is undertaking an ambitious new genomics effort, in partnership with the Geisinger Health System, which treats three million people in Pennsylvania.
Regeneron will sequence DNA from about 100,000 volunteers among Geisinger’s patients, seeking genetic variants linked to different diseases that may provide clues to developing new drugs. Geisinger, in turn, hopes to use the genetic information to improve patient care.
“Scientifically and medically, it’s pretty exciting,” said Dr. Leslie G. Biesecker, chief of the genetic disease research branch at the government’s National Human Genome Research Institute, who is familiar with the project. “As far as I’m aware, it’s the largest clinical sequencing undertaking in this country so far by a long shot.” He added that the move of sequencing into general health care “is going to change medicine.”
Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, the chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said the plummeting cost of DNA sequencing and his own company’s scientific capabilities point toward a more successful effort this time.
“We think we are the right one that can address a lot of the limitations that have kept this from turning into reality before,” he said. Regeneron has opened a genetics research center in Tarrytown, N.Y., where the company is based.
It now costs several thousand dollars to sequence a complete genome, meaning to determine the order of the three billion chemical units of DNA — usually represented by the letters A, C, G and T — in a person’s chromosomes. Even that is still too expensive for a project of this scope. So at first Regeneron will sequence just the exome, the 1 to 2 percent of the DNA that contains the recipes for proteins. A complete exome can be sequenced for less than $1,000.
Similar projects are also beginning, though mostly in the public sector. Britain and Saudi Arabia have each announced plans to sequence 100,000 genomes. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs plans to collect DNA from one million veterans. Various medical centers and health systems have smaller projects.
The biotechnology giant Amgen paid $415 million about a year ago to acquire deCODE Genetics, which had determined, partly through calculations, the genome sequences of 300,000 people in Iceland.
Dr. Yancopoulos might be excused his brashness in predicting success. After two decades of setbacks in developing drugs, Regeneron has broken into the top ranks of the biotechnology industry with its blockbuster product, Eylea, which was approved in 2011 as a treatment for the eye disease called age-related macular degeneration.
Dr. Yancopoulos, who has been at Regeneron since 1989, shortly after the company was founded, earned more than $80 million in compensation in 2012, mostly from stock. The company’s founder and chief executive, Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, was ranked last year by Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News as the life science industry’s third-wealthiest executive, based on the $1.13 billion worth of Regeneron stock he held.
Regeneron and its partner, Sanofi, are in a race against Amgen to be the first to market with a powerful type of cholesterol drug that works by blocking the activity of a protein called PCSK9.
The drugs are based on human genetic discoveries of exactly the type Regeneron hopes to make with its new project. This discovery, however, came from academic scientists who found that people with mutations in the PCSK9 gene had extremely low cholesterol.
David B. Goldstein, a professor of genetics at Duke University, applauded Regeneron’s effort, but said it might be hard for the company to beat academic centers in finding important mutations. “I don’t think there’s a tremendous proprietary value,” Dr. Goldstein said.
Dr. Yancopoulos agreed in part, saying that many of Regeneron’s findings would be made public anyway. But he said the company would have an advantage in developing drugs because it would be the most familiar with the data and because it had leading technology for putting human genes into mice for use in experiments.
The previous generation of gene-hunting studies sampled the DNA of people at particular spots in the genome. Those studies found many common genetic variations that raise or lower the risk of various diseases, but only by a small amount.
The new projects, by sequencing the entire exomes or genomes of huge populations, are looking for rarer variations that might have a bigger influence on disease risk.
“You want the low-frequency, high-impact variants because they are the ones that are going to have more impact on the biology,” said Dr. Jeffrey Gulcher, chief scientist at NextCODE Health, a deCODE spinoff that sells software and services for genomic studies.
Studies trying to link genes to diseases require information on the health of the people whose DNA is being studied. That is where Geisinger comes in. It has extensive electronic medical records on its patients and has already collected 45,000 DNA samples.
To protect patient privacy, the medical information and DNA samples given to Regeneron will be anonymous. But Geisinger will know who the patients are and can use that information in their care.
For instance, if the sequencing finds that a patient has a mutation indicating a high risk of getting breast cancer, the person might be informed and steps might be taken to prevent the disease, said David H. Ledbetter, a geneticist and chief scientific officer at Geisinger. Certain mutations could also provide information helpful in choosing the best drug treatment for the patient.
Regeneron and Geisinger did not disclose financial details of the arrangement. Sequencing 100,000 exomes will probably cost about $100 million over five years, an amount Regeneron can easily handle.
Regeneron will also pay Geisinger, but the health system said it was not selling its patients’ DNA and medical information for a profit. “They are covering our cost,” said Dr. Glenn D. Steele Jr., the chief executive of Geisinger.
He said Geisinger knew it would need genetic information to provide better care, but decided to “farm out” the “factory work” of sequencing and that the health system would share in the proceeds of any drugs developed from the information. Regeneron said it might also collaborate with other academic centers and health systems.

They raised their hands and delivered well-rehearsed statements to our elected representatives.
It’s a familiar bit of theater, but their messages about the security of our personal data when we pay using plastic were startling.
“The innovations that are driving the industry forward and presenting consumers with exciting new methods of making purchases is also rapidly expanding beyond the bounds of our existing regulatory and consumer protection regimes,” went  the written testimony of James A. Reuter, speaking on behalf of the American Bankers Association. “And, as has historically been the case, the criminals are often one step ahead as the marketplace searches for consensus.”
William Noonan of the Secret Service echoed this sentiment in his testimony, noting the rapid increase in the number of criminals trying to acquire financial information and the sophistication of their methods. That gave Mallory Duncan of the National Retail Federation plenty of cover to declare outright, “Data breaches are a fact of life in the United States.”
This sounds a lot like resignation, though some of it is mere posturing as the various parties try to pass the buck and the bill for the damages. But if breaches are nearly inevitable for now, important questions arise: What are your odds of being swept up in all this, and how do you reduce them?
First, some numbers. If you want a good scare, take a look at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse’s interactive chronology of United States data breaches.
A full search since the beginning of 2005 turns up 4,167 breaches that exposed 663,587,386 records of personal information. It is an incomplete list, perhaps by many millions, since thieves often extract information without victims ever knowing.
Nevertheless, January’s tally of instances in which data became vulnerable include the University of California, Davis health system, Snapchat, Coca-Cola, the message boards of the Straight Dope website, Skype, the Wichcraft sandwich chain, the federal Veterans Affairs Department and a county social worker in North Carolina who was supposed to be helping minors and disabled adults and instead stole personal information to aid an income tax fraud scheme. These are the facts of life to which Mr. Duncan referred.
Javelin Strategy and Research released the results of its annual survey of criminal activity this week and found 13.1 million victims in the United States of what it calls identity fraud, which it defines as any unauthorized use of personal information for financial gain. This can include a $3 credit card charge that you did not authorize, and as with any survey, it relies on the memories and interpretations of a diverse array of individuals.
The most eyebrow-raising numbers are the findings that 30.5 percent of people who were swept up in a breach of some sort in 2013 became victims of some kind of identity fraud. That is up from roughly 12 percent just three years ago, as criminals become better at stealing credit and debit card numbers and selling them quickly.
If those figures are right, does that mean that of the 40 million credit and debit card numbers thieves sucked from Target’s payments system, scofflaws will end up using more than 12 million of them successfully? Probably not.
As with any breach, the thieves may not put all the card numbers up for sale. Buyers may not buy all the ones on the market and may not use everything they buy. Then there is the publicity, vigilance and pre-emptively canceled cards that resulted from the large numbers of people involved. “For now, everyone is watching this like a hawk,” said Al Pascual, Javelin’s senior analyst of security, risk and fraud.
But let’s be real about the Target breach and similar ones where thieves get card numbers and, sometimes, email addresses. If you use a credit card to buy things, you’re hopefully reading your statement carefully at least once a month. If a rogue purchase shows up, you call the card issuer, the issuer removes the purchase and that’s usually the end of it. I often cross my fingers when this happens and keep the card, hoping to avoid the rigmarole of changing card numbers and resetting a bunch of automated monthly subscriptions and bills. Still, it’s maybe two hours of work if it comes to that.
Debit card users have bigger problems. Let’s assume that if the thieves did manage to get encrypted PINs from Target, they were unable to crack the code (and withdraw money from A.T.M.’s). Any ordinary debit card purchase sucks the money from the user’s checking account. Unless you’re looking at your balances each day, you may not notice the illicit purchase right away. Once notified, your bank may take days to investigate and put the money back. Automated mortgage payments and other bills may bounce, causing a host of hassles and potential dings on your credit report.
In a world of inevitable breaches, using a debit card for everyday purchases involves some risk. While it’s great for budgeting, users need to check the account activity daily. It’s also wise to have spare cash in a different account to draw on in case a big fraudulent charge leaves the other one temporarily short.
Thieves who have both card numbers and email addresses may try to send messages, pretending to be from the card company, in an attempt to phish for additional information. The note might instruct you to click a link, which may lead to malware on your computer that can extract usernames and passwords and other information. Or you could end up at a site that resembles your bank’s, where you may type in a bunch of personal data. If thieves can get your Social Security number, for instance, they may be able to open new accounts in your name.
Sadly, the default assumption these days has to be that every email asking for personal information — or really any electronic correspondence from a financial institution at all — is fake. That seems extreme, but all it means is that if any of the notes are sounding alarms about your account, type in the web address of the company and look up its call center number. That way, you can talk to a representative who can tell you if the email warnings are legitimate.
You think you would never fall for this, but people slip up. Verizon’s most recent annual fright show of a report on data breaches around the world attributes 29 percent of them to this sort of people-to-people breach, at least in part. There is a bit of bribery and extortion in this category, but 77 percent of the social breaches happen through phishing. And while the person responsible for clicking the wrong link is often unknown, seasoned executives and managers are at least partly to blame 27 percent of the time. They tend to be the primary targets, but it’s worth noting that cashiers, call center workers and guards are one of the links just 11 percent of the time.
I anticipate messing this up sooner or later, which is why I have a security freeze on my credit files. As a result, only companies that I currently do business with can get access to my credit reports. Given that most entities will not open a new account without a credit check, it is the best defense that exists against the most troublesome form of identity theft, in which thieves try to establish new accounts in someone else’s name. For a few bucks, I can temporarily lift the freeze when I want to apply for new lines of credit.
Leading a cash-only life is a theoretical possibility, but it boxes you out of most online shopping and makes traveling difficult. Going cash-only mostly means endless trips to the A.T.M. and all the fees and hassle that come with it.
So cards still offer more benefits than drawbacks for people who don’t get into debt, even if the gap between the two seems to be narrowing. With the right tactics, however, it’s easy enough for most people to greatly bolster their odds of avoiding the worst of the problems.

216,312,2014-02-26T00:00:00Z,article,Study Finds Limited Benefit to Some â€˜Medical Homesâ€™,530d23d938f0d825c76ec074,"subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, organizations:Rand Corp, organizations:Journal of the American Medical Assn, organizations:National Committee for Quality Assurance, glocations:Pennsylvania",Business,0.0,None,"RAND Corporation researchers said that small or medium-size pilot practices did not always meet expectations of improved care, but that they could still benefit patients.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/your-money/study-finds-limited-benefit-to-some-medical-homes.html,974,"RAND Corporation researchers said that small or medium-size pilot practices did not always meet expectations of improved care, but that they could still benefit patients.","You may have heard the term “medical home” to describe a way of organizing doctors’ practices to provide more comprehensive, less costly, patient-friendly treatment. Insurance companies often offer more money to practices that become recognized as medical homes, which use a team approach to coordinate care. States are even looking to medical homes to help save money in their Medicaid programs.
Now, a study of one large, long-running pilot of the medical home approach has found that it resulted in limited quality improvement, and that it didn’t save money, over a three-year period.
The report, by researchers at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group, appears in the Feb. 26 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study evaluated the Southeastern Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative, one of the nation’s earliest and largest medical home pilots. The Commonwealth Fund and Aetna Inc. provided funding for the study.
The pilot included patients in 32 small- and medium-size primary care practices and four different health plans. Researchers compared them with patients in 29 other practices that did not participate in the pilot; over all, the study examined data from about 120,000 people.
The study found that the pilot practices successfully adopted medical home techniques, like creating lists of patients who were overdue for certain services, and received formal recognition as medical homes. The practices were recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which promotes medical homes as a path to better, less expensive care for patients. The N.C.Q.A. has designated more than 6,800 practices as medical homes — often, practices promote this recognition as a marketing tool.
The study found no reduction in patients’ use of emergency rooms or hospitals, however. Practices in the pilot did a better job of monitoring patients with diabetes for kidney disease, the study found, and quality improved for some other aspects of diabetes care, too. But the study found no improvements in other areas, like asthma care and cancer screening. Over all, it found improvements in just one of 11 quality measurements.
Dr. Mark W. Friedberg, a RAND researcher and the study’s lead author, said the results did not necessarily mean that the medical home concept was not beneficial. Rather, it suggests that meeting the concept’s dual goals of better quality and cost containment is challenging, and that the details of how the approach is executed matter. (Previous studies showing cost savings with medical homes have involved larger, integrated health systems, rather than pilots of smaller, independent medical practices.) “Expectations for medical homes are really high,” Dr. Friedberg said. “Right now, it’s a work in progress.”
He said the study was significant, however, because of its size, length of time and the number of health plans involved. He cited several factors that might help explain why the pilot did not show bigger improvements in quality and cost.
For instance, while the pilot emphasized quality of care for diabetes and asthma, participating practices did not have financial incentives to contain costs. And, while most of the practices in the pilot took new steps to improve quality, not as many increased the availability of night and weekend hours, which could have created savings by reducing unnecessary emergency room visits. (More than half the practices in the pilot offered extended hours, but the number of offices doing so did not increase significantly during the study period, Dr. Friedberg said.)
RAND and other researchers are also conducting studies of other medical home pilots, including those in other regions of Pennsylvania. Those studies may help shed more light on what factors make a medical home successful or not, he said. “We need to evaluate them,” he said, to help pinpoint what elements are essential, and refine the model.
Margaret E. O’Kane, president of the N.C.Q.A., said she found the study frustrating because it was based on standards in place in 2008, when the research began. Its medical home standards were updated in 2011, and the committee is about to adopt new standards for 2014 shortly, she said. One example of a change, she said, is that the standards now recommend focusing care management efforts on “high needs” patients rather than patients over all, to obtain the most “bang for the buck.” “The pace of health care research is grindingly slow,” she said. “It feels like being judged on old data.”
Here are some questions to consider about medical homes:
■ Where did the idea of making a doctor’s practice a “medical home” originate?
The notion of medical homes, also called “patient-centered medical homes,” first emerged as a way to manage the care of children with complex medical needs, but has since expanded to include all children and adults. It emphasizes a team approach to care coordinated by a primary care doctor with the help of technology like electronic medical records, and convenient access to care for patients, such as through expanded office hours.
■ Should I seek treatment from a practice that has been recognized as a medical home?
Ms. O’Kane said that in focus groups conducted in 2011, patients overwhelmingly reported a preference for treatment in medical homes: “It’s really great to have walk in and have the doctor know who you are, and coordinate your care,” she said. The RAND study did not look specifically at benefits from the patient’s perspective, in terms of cost. But for you as an individual, “there’s no downside, and potentially an upside,” Dr. Friedberg said. Since the study did find some improvements in quality of care, patients in Pennsylvania with diabetes, in particular, might benefit from seeking care at a participating practice.
■ Where can I find a practice that operates as a medical home?
The National Committee for Quality Assurance has a search tool on its website, recognition.ncqa.org, where you can find practices near you that have been recognized as meeting its criteria.

And so far, it is working out for him. His employer, a big hospital system, provides expensive equipment, takes care of bureaucratic chores and has buffered him from the turmoil of his rapidly changing business.
“This is just a much saner place for me right now,” said Dr. Jonsson, 52, who left private practice to work for the system, Baptist Health, in 2012. “I’m probably going to live another five years.”
About 25 miles away in the more affluent suburb of Crestwood, Dr. Tracy Ragland, 46, an independent primary care physician, is more anxious about the future of her small practice. The law is bringing new regulations and payment rates that she says squeeze self-employed doctors. She cherishes the autonomy of private practice and speaks darkly of the rush of independent physicians into hospital networks, which she sees as growing monopolies.
“The possibility of not being able to survive in a private practice, especially primary care, is very real,” she said.
Dr. Jonsson and Dr. Ragland represent two poles of that primary care system. Both live and work on the outskirts of Louisville, with the patience required of family practitioners who spend long days troubleshooting routine problems like back pain and acid reflux. But the similarities in their practices end there.
About 265,000 residents of Kentucky have signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and most have been found eligible for Medicaid, which the state expanded under the law. Primary care offices are supposed to be their point of entry into the health care system, providing the preventive care and upkeep that are crucial to improving the nation’s health.
As an independent physician, Dr. Ragland must carefully devise strategies to keep her three-person practice afloat amid rising overhead, flat or dropping reimbursement rates, and new federal rules, many of them related to the health care law.
She said that she embraced the goal of extending health coverage to far more Americans, but that Medicaid paid too poorly for her to treat any of the new enrollees. And while she is accepting some of the private plans sold through Kentucky’s new online insurance exchange, she has rejected others — again, because she considers the payment too low.
Only about 40 percent of family doctors and pediatricians remain independent, according to the American Medical Association — and many, including Dr. Ragland, feel that harsh economic winds that were already pushing against them have been accelerated by the Affordable Care Act.
“We’re in an unknown time,” she said.
Dr. Jonsson is less mired in the daily worries of running a medical business. His hospital system, with far more bargaining power than a private practice, negotiates with insurers on his behalf, pays his overhead and malpractice insurance, and handles much of the ever-expanding paperwork. It provides him with an X-ray machine and a costly system for keeping digital patient records, a move encouraged by the new law. He has been able to take his first long vacations in years, including a recent month in his native South Africa.
“It’s that stability factor,” Dr. Jonsson said. “People know they can get a certain amount of salary, and the hospital’s not going anywhere, you know?”
Since the passage of the act in 2010, hospital systems have been acquiring physician practices to shore up their market positions and form networks to take advantage of incentives under the new law. For now, Baptist is taking a financial hit by putting so many doctors on staff: Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its credit rating in September, citing “increased losses from an aggressive and rapid physician employment strategy.”
Baptist enlisted about a dozen of its primary care providers in the Louisville region to take on new Medicaid patients, officials there said, both to get more paying customers in the door and, as a nonprofit system with a stated charitable mission, to help more of Kentucky’s poor get medical care under the law.
“We all have to sort of dig in and work hard and see what happens,” Dr. Jonsson said.
Unhurried Visits
Dr. Ragland is both a general internist and a pediatrician, treating infants to patients in their 90s. Her office is on a winding road lined with horse pastures and upscale subdivisions, with a big sun-splashed waiting room and a Pilates studio next door. She grew up on a farm and does not bother wearing a white coat.
One Monday this month, she saw 15 patients at an unhurried pace, partly because she had some no-shows because of bitterly cold weather.
There was Marcia Robinson, 54, who learned she had shingles in December and was seeking follow-up care before a Caribbean vacation; Dylan Waddle, 10, who had a bad cough; and Margaret Smith, 77, who was dealing with a painful wisdom tooth.
“She’s very attentive,” Mrs. Smith, a retired piano teacher, said of Dr. Ragland. “She doesn’t just cut you off.”
Dr. Ragland has seen a handful of newly insured patients since Jan. 1, but most of her adult patients have insurance through their jobs or Medicare. Some have switched to the new private exchange plans that her office takes — all except those offered by Humana, a large insurer based in Louisville, which she said would have reimbursed 20 percent less than what her office gets for Humana plans outside the exchange. Still, she does not hesitate to recommend the exchange to her patients if she thinks it could help them.
Halfway through her day, Dr. Ragland walked into an exam room and found Aline Burgin, 61, waiting for her. “I haven’t seen you in a while!” she said, noting that Ms. Burgin’s last visit was two years earlier. Ms. Burgin, who works the overnight shift at a nursing home, said she had temporarily dropped her employer-sponsored insurance because it was too expensive.
“It’s $170 out of my paycheck every two weeks,” she said.
“Did you go to the exchange to see if you could qualify for some help?” Dr. Ragland asked.
Ms. Burgin agreed to take the phone number for Kynect, the state exchange. Then she lingered in the exam room, telling Dr. Ragland about her sister’s recent death from emphysema and the guilt she felt about not being with her that day. Dr. Ragland listened for nearly 10 minutes, nodding her head and saying, “Mm-hmm.”
By the time they were finished, 30 minutes had passed — 10 minutes longer than the usual appointment time. It is that kind of flexibility that Dr. Ragland said she treasured about private practice.
“Some patients need five minutes; some patients need all kinds of time and follow-up,” she said. “I never want to be in a situation where my employer tells me I need to be more productive or I’m going to have a severe cut in my pay.”
The next morning, Dr. Ragland and her partners had their monthly meeting with a private consultant they hired recently to take over their billing and help them maximize reimbursements. They talked about their effort to recruit a fourth partner, which has stalled partly because so many young doctors now prefer to work for hospitals. And they examined spreadsheets showing their productivity over the previous month, including how many patients each doctor had seen and how much they had billed for each visit. Productivity was down because of harsh weather.
“I want to rent a truck and pick up patients and say, ‘Go to the doctor!' ” said the consultant, January Taylor-Mills.
One investment Dr. Ragland has delayed making is in a sophisticated electronic records system; for now the doctors are using what Ms. Taylor-Mills called a “very basic” model that is essentially free but not as comprehensive as those used by hospital systems.
As a survival tactic, the practice has joined an “accountable care organization” — a network of physicians, in this case independent, who coordinate care for a group of patients. These networks, encouraged by the new law, reap financial rewards if they improve patients’ health and spend less doing it. Dr. Ragland said her accountable care organization is eager to prove that it can succeed “at probably lower cost than a lot of the hospital systems.”
Ms. Taylor-Mills asked the partners if they were aware that under the Affordable Care Act, primary care doctors could temporarily get reimbursed for seeing Medicaid patients at much higher Medicare rates. The doctors were unmoved; the law raised the rates only for 2013 and 2014.
“It’ll go back down,” said one, Dr. Tony Karem. “It’s all a big game, I think.”
An Influx of Patients
In his Baptist Medical Associates office across from a drab shopping center in Taylorsville, Dr. Jonsson chugged through 30 patient visits one Wednesday in January. He hustled between exam rooms carrying a laptop equipped with voice recognition software, provided by Baptist, that allows him to dictate notes into patients’ digital records.
“There’s no question I have more time,” he said, comparing his life now to when he owned a private practice. But, he added, “I work hard when I’m here.”
For now, hospitals generally provide doctors like him with a baseline salary and potential bonuses tied to productivity — a system likely to change as the Affordable Care Act calls for basing payment on results instead of volume.
His office is utilitarian: a single long hallway lined with exam rooms that Dr. Jonsson, a nurse practitioner and a physician assistant shuttle between. In the waiting room, fliers for other Baptist services — weight-loss surgery, addiction treatment, home health aides — share rack space with magazines like Field and Stream.
Dr. Jonsson, a competitive kayaker who advocates a plant-based diet to anyone who will listen, quickly dispensed with a back pain case and a follow-up visit for chest pain that seemed to be acid reflux. There were also patients with leg cramps, obsessive compulsive disorder, pneumonia and rheumatoid arthritis, most of whom had followed Dr. Jonsson when he went to work for Baptist — or as Steven Pippin, the chest pain patient, put it, “when Obamacare came along.”
Down the hall, Melissa Thomas, the physician assistant, was examining Craig Dooley, a newly insured patient who had limped into Dr. Jonsson’s office with a catalog of ailments, including pain in his knees and shoulders. A physical exam, his first in more than six years, turned up other concerns: possible heart and prostate problems that called for referrals to specialists. He had traveled about 20 miles from Louisville, he said, because he could not find a doctor who would take his newly acquired Medicaid closer to home.
“I wouldn’t normally come all this way,” said Mr. Dooley, 56, who left with referrals to an orthopedist, a urologist and a cardiologist, and an appointment for an overdue colonoscopy. “But I can’t complain. This is good insurance, and I’m overjoyed by having it.”
Dr. Jonsson is accepting new Medicaid patients under the Affordable Care Act because his rural practice has room to grow, said Donna Ghobadi, an assistant vice president at Baptist. In particular, Ms. Thomas and Darline Caldwell, the nurse practitioner, are still building their patient base; Baptist considers these types of providers, who have less training but work with doctors as a team, crucial to taking on new patients in the Affordable Care Act era.
“It’s a way to expand capacity without maybe so much the cost of a physician,” Ms. Ghobadi said.
Dr. Jonsson owned his practice in Louisville for a decade — and did not accept Medicaid, for the same reasons that Dr. Ragland generally does not — but sold it in 2010, months after the Affordable Care Act passed. He did so, he said, expressly out of concern that the law and related requirements were about to ratchet up the pressures and expense of private practice. In particular, he dreaded having to buy and learn how to use an electronic records system, not only because such systems are expensive but because doctors’ productivity slows down while they are learning the computerized systems, threatening tight margins.
“I’m not sure how I could have done it,” Dr. Jonsson said.
When he is done seeing patients, he tends to the grapevines he recently planted on his property with plans to make wine.
“I don’t have to go look at anything related to the finances of the office,” he said. “I can actually go dig a hole on my farm.”
Support for Doctors
On a recent blue-sky morning, Dr. Ragland drove to the State Capitol in Frankfort with a mission: proposing that Kentucky provide scholarships to medical and nursing students who agree to practice primary care in underserved areas for at least three years. She is on the board of the Greater Louisville Medical Society — part of an attempt to become “more outward-looking,” she said — and wants to offer ideas for easing a worsening shortage of primary care doctors.
She sat down with State Representative Larry Clark, the Kentucky House speaker pro tem, and State Representative Jimmie Lee, who oversees the House human services budget. Mr. Lee peered at her, arms crossed, as she made her pitch. Money was tight, he told her, and a new bill that would give experienced nurse practitioners more leeway to practice independently — being voted on by a committee that day — would likely do more to address access issues because there would never be enough primary care doctors.
“I’ve got seven doctors in my family, and there’s not one of them who’s a family practice doctor,” Mr. Lee said. “I’ll tell you why: because they don’t make any money.”
Dr. Ragland smiled, resolute. “Listen, I’m pro-nurse practitioner — very much,” she said. “There’s no question we have to have them, but until we supplement their training they can’t substitute for us, representative.”
The lawmakers suggested a second meeting with members of Gov. Steven L. Beshear’s administration and ushered Dr. Ragland out. She made her way to the building’s cafeteria, where a group of nurse practitioners were celebrating the unanimous committee vote in favor of the bill expanding their authority.
“I don’t get the emphasis on primary care is so important, but primary care physicians aren’t,' ” she said, sitting across the room from the group.
Over the following weeks, the nurse practitioner bill won passage in the Legislature, and Governor Beshear signed it into law. Dr. Ragland had another meeting with the lawmakers, who agreed to keep discussing her proposal and perhaps bring some version of it to the Legislature next year.
In Taylorsville, the new patients are still coming. Dr. Jonsson’s practice has seen dozens of them — even though he left on Jan. 17 for five weeks in South Africa, where he helped at a remote clinic. While he was gone, Ms. Caldwell, the nurse practitioner, and Ms. Thomas, the physician assistant, handled the patient flow.
He had never been able to take more than a week off in private practice, he said — “if you did, you really didn’t earn anything that month because it all went to overhead” — and Baptist’s willingness to let him do so was another source of new happiness. The typical fears about hospital employment — pressure to refer only to other Baptist doctors, for example, or to bring in as much revenue as possible — have not burdened him, he said, at least not yet.
“I don’t know where I’ll be in 10 years,” he said, acknowledging that the uncertainty pervading his profession may lead him down yet another path. “Hopefully I’ll be here and hopefully I’ll be happy, right?”

Tamekia Toure, 40, is typical of the clinic’s new patients, a single mother and recent arrival from Alabama with diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic pain and, for much of her adult life, no health insurance. For her, the new law is a godsend, providing Medicaid coverage that she would not have received before.
Then there is Donna Morse, 61, a widowed dental hygienist and yoga buff who is long overdue for a mammogram and blood work. She lost her insurance last year because it did not meet the new law’s standards. Now she has a new plan with much higher premiums, and which few doctors and hospitals will accept. So she too, warily, has landed at the clinic, one of seven here called Family Health Centers.
David Elson, 60, who has been coming to Family Health Centers for several years now, is a self-employed businessman with a multitude of health problems and medical bills. Despite chronic ailments, he went without insurance for years before enrolling in a subsidized private plan. He has not paid the first month’s premium, and could well fall back into the ranks of the uninsured.
“If you don’t have it, you don’t have it,” he said of the money he owed his new insurer.
A critical phase for the Affordable Care Act ends on Monday, with the closing of the first enrollment period for new insurance plans offered under the landmark law. The Obama administration, which initially predicted that seven million people would sign up for private plans, said last week that more than six million had done so. Independent analysts estimate that more than four million others have enrolled in Medicaid through the law’s expansion of that program.
The law still faces steep challenges in Kentucky and nationwide, not only from energized political opponents who plan to attack it until Election Day, but also from skeptical consumers who think the cost of many new plans is too high, and the choice of doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs too limited. In Kentucky, where sign-ups for Medicaid have far outnumbered those for private coverage, opponents — including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader and an unwavering critic of the law — are predicting higher costs for the state.
Yet beneath the loud debate, the law is quietly starting to change the health care landscape. In Kentucky alone, more than 350,000 people — about 8 percent of the state’s population — have signed up for coverage. Insurers and medical providers are reporting steady demand from the newly covered for health care, ranging from basic checkups to complex surgical procedures.
And in the daily bustle of the seven Family Health Centers clinics scattered around Louisville, a city of 600,000, the law’s early effects are starting to show.
Across the country, community health centers serve more than 20 million people a year, providing primary and preventive care in low-income neighborhoods where private doctors are scant. Their patients are disproportionately uninsured — just over half of the 38,000 patients at Family Health Centers last year had no coverage — and unhealthy.
Like many of those clinics, Family Health Centers is counting on the law to deliver thousands of new paying patients that could help erase debt, raise salaries and hire new staff members.
But the changes are also causing fatigue — and flashes of anger — among the organization’s employees, who are struggling to adjust to a new electronic records system and worrying about accommodating a steady stream of newly insured patients, many of whom require extra attention.
A day after seeing Ms. Toure for the first time, Maria Catalano, a nurse practitioner, listened uneasily as Bill Wagner, the executive director of Family Health Centers, updated the staff on the early effects of the law. More than 54,000 people in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, have gotten coverage since enrollment began on Oct. 1, and Family Health Centers alone has helped nearly 5,000 people apply.
Ms. Catalano raised her hand. “So we don’t have a stop point?” she asked as others nodded in agreement. “We’re just going to keep accepting new patients, new patients, new patients?”
Relief, and Then Worry
Ms. Toure could not believe her luck on the day she arrived for her first appointment. A month earlier, she had moved back to Louisville, her hometown, from rural Alabama, where she had paid dearly for insurance through a minimum-wage job at a gas station. There were additional out-of-pocket costs for drugs and doctor visits, and so she often went without care.
She had been uninsured for long periods of her adult life, suffering through toothaches that hurt “worse than labor pain,” and relying on her mother, a fellow diabetic, to mail her some of her own medication.
“I would never want anyone to go through the pain and torment that I went through as far as not being able to take medicine,” she said.
When she returned to Louisville with her four children, she went to apply for food stamps and learned she could also apply for health insurance through Kynect, the state’s new online marketplace. With no income except her 16-year-old son’s disability check, she qualified for Medicaid — which would not have been possible in Alabama, one of 24 states that has not expanded Medicaid.
“The first thing in my mind was just happiness,” Ms. Toure said.
Since receiving coverage, Ms. Toure has seen a dentist to get a painful tooth removed. New Medicaid patients can also see private orthopedists, neurologists and other specialists, addressing problems they may have endured for years. Newly insured patients have flooded Family Health Centers with requests for referrals; its largest clinic, in Louisville’s impoverished West End, had a backlog of several hundred requests in mid-March and was hiring temporary workers to help patients arrange appointments.
“People have insurance, and they’re getting important care,” said Janet Kleinhelter, a medical receptionist at Family Health Centers who is spending long days working through the backlog of referral requests. “But we weren’t quite prepared for this.”
Ms. Toure had been off her medications for a month when she arrived at Ms. Catalano’s clinic, near the famous Churchill Downs racetrack. She got a thorough workup, new prescriptions and referrals to a weight-loss specialist and a hospital for an X-ray of her spine. As a Medicaid patient, she paid nothing. “I like you guys,” she said, beaming beneath her stylish bob.
But even as she felt the relief of being insured, Ms. Toure faced a new potential problem. After her appointment that day, she went to a job interview at Amazon, which has warehouses in the area, and got hired.
She was elated to find work so quickly — “In Alabama, it took me years,” she said — but also a little scared. Would her new income make her ineligible for Medicaid, so soon after she had signed up? With the expanded program, this so-called churning in and out of Medicaid, based on changes in income, is expected to be common, and for many, problematic.
“I really expect to lose it,” Ms. Toure said.
Higher Costs Now for Some
When Ms. Morse, the dental hygienist, came for her first appointment at Family Health Centers that same morning, she had finally given up smoking, five years after her husband died of lung cancer. But she had gained 20 pounds as candy became her substitute vice. In October, she had been shocked to learn that her longtime insurance policy through Humana was getting canceled.
“I’m really not very happy with what my experience has been,” Ms. Morse said.
She is among several million Americans, many of them middle class, who lost insurance last year because those plans did not provide all the benefits required under the law. The wave of cancellations, coupled with the stumbling rollout of the online marketplace, caused a political crisis for President Obama that continues to affect Democrats around the country.
After she lost her old plan, Humana sent her a chocolate bar — dark and “heart healthy,” the wrapper said — to thank her for her loyalty. She is off candy now, but she saved it as a memento.
She then went to work researching plans through Kynect, and learned that because of her earnings — in addition to her hygienist’s salary, she gets some income from her husband’s life insurance policy — she did not qualify for a subsidy. So she is paying $448 a month for a new Humana plan, up from the $258 monthly premium she paid before.
Needing to find a new doctor, she called several who would not take her new insurance. So she arrived at Family Health Centers, which she would not have considered before. “They were not in the best area,” she explained.
At her first appointment, on her lunch break, Ms. Morse was dressed in a royal-blue uniform and clasping her hands as she talked with Ms. Catalano and Tanisha Thompson, a nurse-practitioner student. Her blood pressure was borderline high, and she needed a mammogram and a colonoscopy.
“I’ll do whatever y’all say,” Ms. Morse said.
Ms. Morse, who lives with her grown daughter in a bungalow-style home with a porch swing in a quiet neighborhood in Louisville’s South End, did not want to go on blood pressure medication just yet, preferring a holistic approach. But her blood work showed her cholesterol was high enough to require medicine immediately.
So she drove to the Walgreens near her house to pick up the prescription, but discovered that the chain did not accept her new Humana policy, a so-called narrow network plan with a limited number of providers.
But despite that problem, and the cost of her new plan — which she called “a kick in the butt” — she declared herself “very pleasantly surprised” with her experience at the clinic. And unlike many who have had policies canceled because of the law, she said she could see its benefits.
“I’m really thankful that a lot of people are getting health care that couldn’t have it in the past,” she said.
Now, she just hopes that she will qualify for a subsidy after she retires, perhaps later this spring.
“Then maybe I’ll be able to be part of health reform,” she said.
Selecting the Right Plan
Mr. Elson, the self-employed businessman, is just the kind of person who should benefit from the Affordable Care Act. Diabetes has taken a toll on his body and his finances, weakening his heart and kidneys and leaving him with so much debt that bankruptcy is a lurking possibility.
He went to Family Health Centers last fall to see about signing up for coverage and learned he was eligible for a substantial subsidy, $252 a month. But he found the choices so overwhelming that he put off a decision, losing the paperwork amid the clutter of his shotgun home.
Months passed. The harsh winter proved terrible for his business installing burglar alarms. Off his diabetes medicines because he could not afford them, Mr. Elson had emergency surgery to stanch bleeding at the back of his eyes — another bill he could not pay — and spent many hours in bed, the warmest place in his house.
“The work just dried up,” Mr. Elson said recently over a dinner of chicken and ribs.
In February, he went to his kidney doctor, who said that his blood pressure was up. He complained of a pain in his chest, and she told him to get an echocardiogram, “preferably today.” When he went to pay for the doctor visit, he was told that the fee for uninsured patients had risen to $70, more than three times the cost for previous appointments. He left without the echocardiogram and has not returned.
But later that week, Mr. Elson did return to Family Health Centers and, with the help of a counselor, chose a plan, one of the few that all of his doctors would accept. With the subsidy, he would owe $350 a month toward the premium. The midlevel plan, offered by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, had a deductible of $2,600. But his income, about $28,000 last year, was low enough to qualify for additional help paying out-of-pocket costs for health care and medications up to that amount.
Mr. Elson was satisfied. But his nurse practitioner at Family Health Centers, Susan Elrod, was worried: “He’ll never be able to afford that.”
Nationally, as many as about 20 percent of those who signed up for coverage that took effect in January have failed to pay their premiums on time, according to insurance companies and industry experts. Others may be keeping up with their premium costs but struggling to meet high deductibles, which many of the new plans have.
Mr. Elson is long divorced and lives alone but has an affectionate relationship with his daughter, who lives several states away. He carefully tends his backyard garden, jarring tomatoes and storing them on a shelf in his kitchen. Perhaps partly because of his advanced disease, he can be forgetful and disorganized: His home is strewn with alarm equipment, buckets of empty diet soda cans and unopened mail. In January, he said, he neglected to bill his customers who pay monthly.
“I plum forgot,” he said, shrugging.
His first premium payment was due March 8, for coverage that was to take effect March 1, and he missed the deadline. Several customers owed him money, he said, and after paying his rent, water bill and the fee for a car he had rented after his van broke down, he did not have enough money left for insurance.
He got some free diabetes medicine from Family Health Centers in February, but it was meant to last only a few weeks.
“That’s the next bill I’m paying,” he said. “You can trust me on that.”
Challenges for Providers
Family Health Centers has always been one of the few medical providers in Louisville to take all comers, regardless of their ability to pay, and it will not abandon that role in the Affordable Care Act era, said Mr. Wagner. Even last month, as a record percentage of its patients presented insurance cards, almost 30 percent of the medical appointments were still for “self-pay” customers with no coverage.
But already, the change in its patient mix is striking. The number of visits by Medicaid recipients last month was 30 percent higher than in February 2013. Visits by uninsured patients fell by 52 percent, to 1,760 from 3,697. Visits by patients with private insurance dropped slightly, but Mr. Wagner hopes they will rise as more people like Ms. Morse discover Family Health Centers and like what they find.
For now, the new revenue from Medicaid — which reimburses community health centers at a higher rate than private doctors — should help Family Health Centers erase a $2 million deficit in its $28 million budget, Mr. Wagner said.
With the new revenue, he also hopes to raise salaries and recruit new doctors to replace several who left over the last year. Mr. Wagner is in negotiations with five candidates; if he succeeds in hiring them, it could help ease the pressure on nurse practitioners, who now make up 60 percent of the clinic’s medical staff, but who rely on doctors for advice and support.
Ms. Elrod, the nurse practitioner who treats Mr. Elson, was among the staff members who were feeling demoralized as the enrollment period drew to a close, even as they were happy to see more patients getting coverage. She said it has been tough getting used to the electronic record system and a new “open-access” scheduling system, which is supposed to eliminate long waits for appointments but has kept some patients from seeing their usual doctors or nurse practitioners.
Dr. Michelle Elisburg, a pediatrician at Family Health Centers, sounded equally worn as she spoke of her frustrations with electronic records, which swallow more of her time than paper charts used to. “Hours at home,” she said, “signing all the charts, all completely uncompensated.”
Mr. Wagner, a Louisville native in his fourth decade at the clinic, keeps pleading for perseverance.
“It’s been the year of the most change of any year since I’ve been here,” he told the staff not long ago. “We’re reinventing the wheel.”

But it still does not do enough to advance the goal President Obama set two years ago for “clear rules of the road” on privacy.
In January, Mr. Obama asked John Podesta, a senior adviser, to take on this issue. Like a previous report  on privacy published in 2012, the new one does a fine job of laying out some of the benefits and problems associated with the extensive collection and use of personal data by businesses and institutions. (The new report does not cover the activities of intelligence agencies.)
Mr. Podesta and his team note that such data can be incredibly useful. To take one example, careful analysis of the voluminous health records collected by hospitals and doctors’ offices could help identify the spread of infectious diseases. But the data can also be used by businesses to discriminate against certain groups, like the poor or minorities, by making it easy to avoid selling a product or service to some people or to charge them higher prices.
Some of the report’s recommendations are right on the mark. It proposes strengthening the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which was passed in 1986, so that law enforcement agencies have to seek the same court approval to gain access to digital content like email that they need for physical information like letters. Currently, law enforcement agencies can obtain email messages from companies like Google without first obtaining a warrant from a court if those messages have been opened or if they have been on a computer server for more than 180 days. The report also recommends extending to foreigners the privacy protections that are afforded to Americans.
But other proposals could weaken privacy protections if the administration does not proceed carefully. For example, Mr. Podesta and his team want Congress to pass a law that would require companies to disclose publicly instances when personal information is stolen from their computer systems. But many consumer advocates are rightly worried that a poorly written federal law could pre-empt even stronger disclosure requirements enacted by some states like California.
Another recommendation, which is included in a technical analysis that accompanies Mr. Podesta’s report, argues that policy makers “should focus more on the actual uses of big data and less on its collection and analysis.” The problem with this idea is that consumers have the most control over their information when it is being collected. Once businesses have amassed the information, it can be hard, if not impossible, for individuals to know how it will be used in the future.
Most Americans think current laws are insufficient to protect their privacy, according to a Pew Research survey. Mr. Obama has previously said he feels the same way. The Podesta report offers some good recommendations that deserve enactment, even as the administration refines other proposals that still need work.

When a rare ice storm threatened New Orleans in January, some residents heard from a city official who had gained access to their private medical information. Kidney dialysis patients were advised to seek early treatment because clinics would be closing. Others who rely on breathing machines at home were told how to find help if the power went out.
Those warnings resulted from vast volumes of government data. For the first time, federal officials scoured Medicare health insurance claims to identify potentially vulnerable people and share their names with local public health authorities for outreach during emergencies and disaster drills.
The program is just one of a growing number of public and corporate efforts to take health information far beyond the doctor’s office, offering the promise of better care but also raising concerns about patient privacy.
In some cities, text messages remind parents to get their children vaccinated. Elsewhere, emergency medical services sift records to identify — sometimes to law enforcement officials — “frequent fliers” who take repeated, costly ambulance trips. In New Orleans, a health care information exchange notifies primary care physicians when their patients are admitted to hospitals, offers insurers the ability to sift the data for “high-cost users” and permits authorized individuals to “break the glass” in emergencies — viewing records of patients who have not previously given permission and cannot speak for themselves. And a federal program allows data sharing with public health officials to monitor “mental health conditions” and other illnesses in hazardous situations, like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
“There are a lot of sensitivities involved here,” said Kristen Finne, a senior policy analyst at the Department of Health and Human Services. “When we started this idea,” she said, referring to using Medicare data for disaster assistance, “there was a lot of ‘are you crazy?’ ”
Ms. Finne noted that the program was painstakingly designed to comply with privacy laws.
Aspects of the Medicare program were tested in New Orleans; in Broome County, N.Y., which includes Binghamton; and in Arizona. The program was presented to state and local public health officials last month. “We are now moving to scale this really across the country,” said Dr. Nicole Lurie, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response.
The health officials’ intention was to be more proactive in finding vulnerable people like those who suffered and died in disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy. When government teams knocked on doors last year to verify the data and gauge reactions, nearly all the residents allowed them in. Only those who asked how they were found were told.
About a dozen advocates for people with disabilities who were briefed by officials generally expressed support and appreciation of the concern for their community’s needs in emergencies.
Others find the program troubling, however well intentioned. “I think it’s invasive to use their information in this way,” said Christy Dunaway, who works on emergency planning for the National Council on Independent Living, which supports disabled people living at home.
She and others said they were worried that identified individuals could be forced to evacuate to shelters that cannot accommodate people with disabilities, or that incomplete data could provide false assurances of government rescue.
For now, at least, federal officials have resolved not to identify people in “stigmatized groups” who might need help in emergencies, such as those with mental illnesses or intellectual disabilities, or those who are obese.
Dr. Karen DeSalvo, a former New Orleans health director who helped develop the Medicare pilot program and now leads the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, said that the program protected patient privacy and that its benefits outweighed its risks. “This is the next chapter of what good data can do for good purposes,” she said. The federal government has spent more than $22 billion for the digitizing of health records.
“We are all going to have to, I’m hoping, come to some consensus with how we’re balancing privacy and security with the need to save somebody’s life,” Dr. DeSalvo said.
The idea for the program began in Tuscaloosa, Ala., after a tornado struck in April 2011. An ambulance rolled up to one of the houses left standing to take a woman to the hospital because she had run out of oxygen. “That’s kind of crazy, why can’t somebody bring her an oxygen tank?” Dr. Lurie recalled thinking after watching the scene.
She witnessed a similar phenomenon in New York after Hurricane Sandy. Patients who relied on medical equipment needed a place to plug it in before draining the batteries. Many crowded into emergency rooms, stressing the health care system. Others had no way to call for help. Eventually, emergency teams knocked on every door of darkened high-rises, because officials did not know where the people who needed assistance were.
“All of these people just came out of the woodwork,” Dr. Lurie said one public health official told her after a disaster in New England.
“I started to seethe,” Dr. Lurie said. “It’s your job to know who lives in your community.” And if local officials did not, she added, it was the federal government’s responsibility to help.
Respecting the importance of federal and state laws that restrict the disclosure of medical data, the officials found a legal route for Medicare to transfer data on patients’ bills for medical equipment to public health authorities who have systems in place to protect patient privacy. They published a description of it in the Federal Register.
“Now every Medicare beneficiary, at least theoretically, is on notice that their information could be shared in this way,” said Kevin Horahan, a policy analyst with Dr. Lurie’s office.
New Orleans was the first test site. One day last June, with a pretend hurricane bearing down on the city, local officials received 611 names and addresses of residents who depended on oxygen equipment and ventilators. The next day, they sent police, fire and emergency services personnel, along with public health officials and credentialed citizen volunteers, to visit about a third of the homes and see how reliable the information was.
Ms. Finne, the Health Department official, joined a team canvassing one of the poorest sections of New Orleans. “We went and knocked on doors and asked, ‘Does Mrs. Smith live here and have an oxygen concentrator?’ ” she said. Revelations of surveillance on American citizens by the National Security Agency had hit the news five days earlier. “It was one of those situations that you’re like, how are these people going to respond to us showing up?” she said. “Why is government showing up at my doorstep?”
A few residents refused to open their doors, but a vast majority were grateful, Ms. Finne said. The information was both accurate and revealing. In one neighborhood, not a single person with an electronic breathing device had a backup battery in case of a power failure. More than half of those asked said they would need assistance in the event of a hurricane. However, only 15 of the 611 had enrolled in the city’s special needs registry, for those requiring assistance in an emergency. Results of the survey were posted online on Thursday and set to be published in the July issue of the American Journal of Public Health.
A recent power failure affected René Brunét Jr., the 92-year-old owner of New Orleans’ oldest operating movie theater, the Prytania. He uses a ventilator to support his breathing. “I was frightened to death when I was without oxygen for so long,” he said in an interview.
During the drill last June, he was not among those visited by the public health teams. “Believe me, we would have welcomed it,” said his wife, Muriel S. Brunét, 70.
Dr. Lurie’s office is developing a device that can alert family members or rescuers when batteries on medical equipment are low. The Department of Health and Human Services also plans to release an interactive online map this year indicating how many Medicare beneficiaries have wheelchairs and other medical equipment in various ZIP codes, in part to help health officials think about where to place shelters, stockpile supplies, and inform hospitals and power companies about potential needs.
“Even that information is light-years ahead of what they have currently,” Ms. Finne said.

President Obama announced Mr. Shinseki’s departure after a 45-minute Oval Office meeting between the two men that ended a week of mounting demands from both parties for the secretary to step down. Mr. Obama, who appeared pained at the turn of events, hailed Mr. Shinseki as having an unquestioned commitment to the nation’s veterans, but he said the political storm had made Mr. Shinseki’s continuing leadership untenable.
“We don’t have time for distractions,” Mr. Obama said. “We need to fix the problem.”
Fixing the problem at the department now becomes an urgent political matter for the president, once again raising questions about whether the candidate who pledged in 2008 and 2012 to make government work efficiently has lost grasp of the government he now leads.
The department’s troubles, however, remain a far more serious concern for the millions of veterans whose access to timely health care has been steadily eroding as waves of wounded soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan have converged with those who returned from earlier wars.
Most of the veterans now seeking treatment at department facilities are aging Vietnam-era service members, many with chronic illnesses like diabetes that require long-term care or with cancer and cardiovascular disease that require complicated and expensive treatment. Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are further straining the system with mental health problems like post-traumatic stress disorder.
Veterans’ demand for medical services is soaring. The number of outpatient visits to V.A. health care facilities has grown by 26 percent over the last five years, to 94.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the department. Over the same period, the number of staff doctors and nurses has grown by 18 percent.
The effort to resolve the fundamental problems at the department will also play out in Congress, where Republicans say the problem is not a lack of money — the department’s $154 billion annual budget has more than doubled since 2006 — but rather inefficiencies in the delivery of care. Democrats say that the problem is a serious shortage of doctors and not enough hospitals.
“This is going to be a slow grind,” a senior administration official said of the need to overhaul the department. “A lot of the problems, they are not just systemic, but they are chronic. It’s like, roll up your sleeves, start digging into the culture and get rid of people who are impeding necessary change.”
“It won’t be pretty,” said the official, who asked for anonymity to be blunt about the challenge facing Mr. Obama in the months ahead.
One immediate question is whether the departure of Mr. Shinseki will have any real impact on the agency’s deep-seated problems. Mr. Shinseki apologized in a speech on Friday morning, before Mr. Obama accepted his resignation, saying that he was “too trusting” of some people working for him. He criticized a “systemic, totally unacceptable lack of integrity” at some veterans health care centers that he said he could not explain.
Defenders of Mr. Shinseki point out that problems at the Veterans Affairs Department, the country’s largest health care system, were far worse during the Vietnam era. Despite the current problems, many veterans say that the quality of care delivered — once they are able to get into the system — is much better today.
In addition, the veterans agency has a history of innovation in its health care programs, including advances in the treatment of spinal cord injuries, improvements in artificial limbs, increased use of electronic health records and the investigation of medical errors.
But the problems described Friday in an internal audit are remarkably similar to those documented six years ago in a report to the department by Booz Allen Hamilton, the management consulting company. The Booz Allen report found “chronic delays in care” at veterans hospitals and clinics, resulting in part from “the current shortage of nurses, nurse practitioners, primary care providers and specialty physicians.”
Mr. Shinseki had already been challenged by some of those problems during his five years at the department’s helm. A year ago, he and Mr. Obama had what aides described as a “come to Jesus” meeting in which the president demanded that Mr. Shinseki deal with a huge backlog of disability claims that were delaying benefits to veterans.
But the recent allegations that officials manipulated waiting lists for thousands of veterans across the country exposed even bigger issues. The department’s internal audit, which Mr. Shinseki presented to the president on Friday, attributed the scheduling scandal to the agency’s “overarching environment and culture which allowed this state of practice to take root.”
The audit said that the department’s culture “must be confronted head-on if it is to evolve to be more capable of adjusting systems, leadership and resources to meet the needs of veterans and families.”
The audit was unsparing in its documentation of the extent of problems. It found, for example, that at least one instance of reporting false patient wait-time data had occurred in nearly two-thirds of the department’s facilities. “Such practices are sufficiently pervasive to require V.A. to re-examine its entire performance management system,” the audit said.
The seeds of Mr. Shinseki’s departure may have been planted years ago, when he established standards that his supporters said were admirable but unrealistically high. He set 125 days as the goal for processing disability claims and was then blamed for the backlog that ensued. For new patients, he required that veterans be seen within two weeks.
In the audit, that 14-day standard was singled out as an “organizational leadership failure” and a major problem in providing timely care, second only to a shortage of doctors.
In announcing Mr. Shinseki’s departure, Mr. Obama said a number of department officials, including in Phoenix, the medical center that spawned the current scandal, would be fired. He also said that bonuses would not be paid to senior V.A. health care executives.
Now, the challenge for Mr. Obama will be finding someone who has the ability not just to lead a department with nearly 300,000 employees, but also steer it in a new direction. Mr. Obama said Friday that Sloan Gibson, Mr. Shinseki’s deputy and the president’s choice to be the acting secretary, will not lead the department over the long run.
“There is a need for a change in culture within the V.H.A.,” Mr. Obama said, referring to the Veterans Health Administration, “and perhaps the V.A. as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed.”
Among the names mentioned as Mr. Shinseki’s possible successors by lawmakers and officials at veterans organizations are Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, who was under secretary of Veterans Affairs from 1994 to 1999; Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, a veteran who served as assistant secretary at the department; Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana; and Jim Webb, a veteran who was a Democratic senator from Virginia and a secretary of the Navy.
The president may also face a difficult time getting Congress to agree on legislation and financing to make the necessary changes. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have demonstrated vastly different visions for reforming the department.
Speaker John A. Boehner said Friday that “until the president outlines a vision and an effective plan for addressing the broad dysfunction at the V.A., today’s announcement really changes nothing.”
Republicans like Representative Jeff Miller of Florida, who is chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, blamed how the department’s resources were divvied up for much of its problems. “The middle-management administrative functions have grown exponentially over the last few years,” Mr. Miller said.
Senator Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent and chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said that although more accountability was needed, lack of resources was a major problem.
“I suspect very strongly there are parts of the country that we simply do not have the number of doctors and nurses we need, and those will cost money,” he said.
Part of the department’s problems stems from sheer size: Not only is it the nation’s largest health care system — with nine million enrolled veterans served at 150 medical centers and 800 outpatient clinics — it is among the largest workers’ compensation systems, charged with disbursing annual disability payments to nearly four million veterans.
In addition, many of the more recent patients are seeking treatment for profound injuries that would not have been survivable in earlier wars but are today, in part because of mandatory body armor and improvements in front-line medical care.

Of the eight million people who signed up for private health plans through insurance exchanges under the new health care law, two million reported personal information that differed from data in government records, according to federal officials and Serco, the company hired to resolve such inconsistencies.
The government is asking consumers for additional documents to verify their income, citizenship, immigration status and Social Security numbers, as well as any health coverage that they may have from employers. People who do not provide the information risk losing their subsidized coverage and may have to repay subsidies next April.
Federal subsidies for the purchase of private insurance are a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. More than eight out of 10 people who selected health plans through the exchanges from October through mid-April were eligible for subsidies, including income tax credits. So far this year the federal government has paid out $4.7 billion in subsidies, and the amount is expected to total $900 billion over 10 years.
Since June 1, the government has notified hundreds of thousands of people that “the information in your application doesn’t match what we found in other records.” Accordingly, the notice says, “you need to follow up as soon as possible and provide more documents to make sure the marketplace has the correct information.”
“If you don’t send the needed documents,” it says, “you risk losing your marketplace coverage or help you may be receiving to pay for such coverage.”
The government has a long list of documents that consumers can use to establish their eligibility. These include copies of birth certificates, Social Security cards, high school diplomas, driver’s licenses, pay stubs and voter registration cards.
“The law requires us to double- and triple-check this data,” said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, so “we’re reaching out to consumers — via mail, email and phone calls — to encourage them to provide supporting documentation.”
Mara Youdelman, a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for low-income people, said: “In some cases, consumers say they already sent the documents to the federal marketplace. They don’t understand why they are being asked to send them in again.”
Even though consumers have sent documents to Serco’s office in London, Ky., the government cannot always link the documents to applications for coverage filed months earlier. In addition, some consumers report persistent problems when they try to upload documents through HealthCare.gov.
For months, Republicans have asserted that the administration was lax in verifying the income and eligibility of people who applied for insurance subsidies.
The government enrolled people “before the systems were in place to accurately confirm eligibility,” said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee.
In some cases, the government told consumers that they had been found eligible for subsidized insurance and could enroll right away. But to keep the coverage, it said, they had to “send the marketplace more information” to verify their eligibility.
Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota, said “many Americans are going to find out that they owe money to the Internal Revenue Service because their premium tax credits were paid incorrectly.”
Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, said such remarks showed the Republicans’ “unending zeal to undermine the Affordable Care Act.”
At the same time, supporters of the health care law worry that some of its chief beneficiaries will be upset if they find next spring that their tax liability is greater than they expected.
Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said he believed that the government would not find major discrepancies in the amounts most consumers should receive in premium tax credits. But he said, “We share concerns that the longer the process of verifying and resolving inconsistencies takes, the more some consumers will owe when they reconcile their tax returns.”
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that subsidies this year will average $4,400 for each person who receives a subsidy. Federal law generally limits the amount that lower- and moderate-income people may be required to repay. A family of four with an annual income of $80,000 could be required to repay as much as $2,500.
Executives at Serco, the federal contractor, said that technical problems with HealthCare.gov had limited their ability to investigate discrepancies.
Until late May, a Serco executive said, the company had to rely on “manual processes” to resolve conflicts between information provided by consumers and information in government databases.
The government was supposed to develop a system to scan documents and transfer information automatically into electronic files, but the system was not developed, so Serco employees had to type in the information. Serco said it took an hour to perform tasks that were expected to take just five minutes.
Subsidies depend on household income and the number of people in a family seeking assistance. But internal memorandums from the Department of Health and Human Services say that the insurance exchanges had no way to verify family size.
The government has also had difficulty checking information about employer-sponsored insurance. The Obama administration delayed until 2015 a requirement for employers to inform the government of insurance that they provide. Workers are generally ineligible for subsidies if they have access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage that meets basic federal standards.

The company also announced a partnership with Epic Systems, one of the largest suppliers of electronic medical record systems in the United States. This has led many to speculate that a new age is upon us, with patients having much greater access to health information, as well as the ability to share it with their doctors.
Let me be clear about one thing: I love information technology. I’m an early adopter of all kinds. I own an iPhone and many other Apple products. I have also received many grants and published many papers on the use of mobile technology for chronic disease management. I’m as pro-I.T. and pro-mobile technology as they come.
Yet I’m very skeptical we will see any great changes in the near future because of this development. A lack of true communication between information systems poses a huge challenge for these types of products. Although a law known as the Hitech Act, enacted as part of the stimulus package in 2009, encouraged hospitals and medical offices to start using electronic health records systems, it didn’t adequately address how to make different systems talk to each other. And so it’s common for practices, hospitals and emergency rooms to be unable to share data because they don’t use the same types of systems.
In addition, both Epic and Apple are known for being closed with respect to data access. That means patients who use these services would be forced to remain in those systems or face losing their data.
But the issues surrounding the technology pale in comparison with those surrounding people themselves. In 2009, Charles Friedman proposed a “fundamental theorem of biomedical informatics.” It stated that a human working with a resource like information technology is better than a human alone. But it also stated a corollary, that people are more important than technology. This is a key point. Real change happens when people change their behavior, not when new technology appears.
Let’s confront some of the issues on the patient side first. Not everyone wants to share daily data with physicians. Patients can be notoriously uncompliant with our recommendations. Take diabetes: Adherence to insulin regimens is “generally poor,” and not just because injecting insulin can be painful and, if done in public, uncomfortable for some.
I’ve studied this myself. We interviewed adolescents with diabetes, and their parents. Both groups were often skeptical about sharing too much information. No one likes to be nagged. In fact, one of our biggest concerns was that if technology caught patients not doing what they were supposed to, they’d stop using it.
We also need to be realistic about who is going to use this technology, and how much it can help them. Older patients, the very sick and the poor — those who need the most assistance — will probably be the least likely to do so, in part because they’re typically not heavy users of Apple products.
The biggest barrier, however, is physicians. No doctor, no matter how dedicated, wants to know every glucose value of every patient every day, or each patient’s daily weight or blood pressure measurement. Physicians barely have enough time to get their work done as it is. None of them could survive this information overload. Sometimes these individual data points aren’t even important, but when they are — for example, blood-sugar readings for diabetics — physicians might worry about being held liable for missing an abnormal reading. More than a third of physicians have reported personally missing test results that led to care delays for their patients because they are already overwhelmed by alerts and data.
An alternative solution, and one we attempted in our research, is to create systems in which patients’ data are monitored automatically to detect both good and bad outcomes. Then, physicians or their staff could be notified to contact patients if something goes awry.
This still creates a lot of work for offices and hospitals. Contacting patients can be hard and time-consuming. The results of our work were a modest success at best, and only with respect to short-term outcomes. It’s difficult for individual offices to create these systems, and there’s no reason to believe that if Apple or Epic did so that individual doctors’ offices would find them easy to use.
Moreover, doctors will not want to invest their time or money until a critical mass of patients demand it. They aren’t going to design systems for the small number of original users. Nor are they going to change the way their offices function for them. And until they do so, the early adopters will have no one using the large amounts of data they are collecting and sending.
It’s unbelievably hard to change physician behavior. It’s even harder to get them to use electronic health records and information technology. Before the Hitech Act, back in the “dark ages” of 2006, only 11 percent of office-based physicians had electronic health records that met criteria for a “basic system.” That number rose, after a lot of spending, to 48 percent of office-based physicians in 2013.
But that’s a “basic system,” not one that’s ready to accept data sharing from patients’ iPhones. Moreover, and this can’t be minimized, one of the most significant factors leading to physician dissatisfaction isn’t reduced salaries or malpractice — it’s interacting with an electronic health record. Doctors don’t like them, and they often have good reasons for feeling this way.
These systems often don’t work as advertised. They’re expensive. They can be difficult to use and maintain. They can interfere with clinical practice. They can increase inefficiency. They can even get in the way of a good doctor-patient relationship. Until these factors are fixed, the likelihood of a big expansion into iPhone Health sharing seems small, no matter how excited those promoting it may be.
“Shared information could revolutionize health care,” proclaimed a paper in Modern Healthcare. The abstract read: “Hospitals soon may learn the value of shared information technology. The idea of ‘community health information networks’ is picking up steam as payers and policymakers look for ways to control costs and measure the quality of care.” That paper was published in 1992. I’m still waiting.

In a report to Congress on Tuesday, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, Daniel R. Levinson, said that the exchanges, which enrolled eight million people, did not have adequate safeguards “to prevent the use of inaccurate or fraudulent information when determining eligibility.”
Moreover, in a companion report, the inspector general said that the government had been unable to verify much of the information reported by people applying for insurance coverage and financial assistance to help pay premiums.
“As of the first quarter of 2014,” Mr. Levinson said, “the federal marketplace was unable to resolve about 2.6 million of 2.9 million inconsistencies” — 89 percent of the discrepancies — because its automated eligibility system was “not fully operational.”
Most of the discrepancies involved citizenship, immigration status or income.
The conflicts do not imply wrongdoing. But without resolving the many inconsistencies, Mr. Levinson said, “the marketplace cannot ensure that an applicant meets each of the eligibility requirements.”
Even when consumers provided “appropriate documentation,” he said, the government was often unable to resolve conflicts between federal records and data on application forms, signed by consumers under penalty of perjury.
The administration, he said, did not have effective controls in place to perform basic tasks like validating Social Security numbers and verifying the identity of people who applied by telephone.
Federal officials are running insurance marketplaces for three dozen states. The other states are running their own.
Mr. Levinson said that an electronic “data services hub,” which links federal and state agencies, had problems, so states could not always verify data reported by people seeking subsidized insurance. Even when the data hub was working, he said, some information provided by federal agencies appeared to be inaccurate or outdated.
“One marketplace cited situations in which infants and young children included on applications were erroneously identified as incarcerated, according to federal data,” the inspector general said. Another marketplace “reported that it had about 15,000 applications that it could not verify, because of data hub outages.”
Four of the state marketplaces told the inspector general that they could not resolve some data discrepancies because of problems in their own information technology systems. The states were Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Vermont.
Republicans in Congress said the findings supported their contention that the administration had rushed to pay subsidies before it could verify eligibility.
“The administration moved forward with implementation despite repeated warnings that the systems were not ready,” said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said, “Regardless of your political affiliation, the findings in these reports should concern every taxpayer.”
Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal exchange and supervises the state exchanges, said the problems were not surprising.
“This is the first year that consumers have applied for coverage through the marketplaces,” she said. “Therefore, consumers are inexperienced with the eligibility process, which could lead to application mistakes.”
But to date, Ms. Tavenner said, “there has been no evidence of an applicant defrauding the federally facilitated marketplace or a state-based marketplace in order to unlawfully enroll in a qualified health plan or take advantage” of subsidies for which the person was ineligible.
Moreover, she said, consumers will face a reckoning at tax time next spring. People who have received more in subsidies than they are entitled to may have to repay some or all of the difference with their income taxes.
Cleaning up problems in the federal and state exchanges is one of the biggest challenges facing the new secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell.
The inspector general’s report on “internal controls” was required under a law adopted last October. The same law called for the health secretary to certify that the exchanges were verifying eligibility before the government started paying subsidies. Kathleen Sebelius, then the health secretary, provided those assurances in a letter to Congress dated Jan. 1, two weeks before the subsidy payments began.
In view of the new findings, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Tuesday that those assurances were misleading.
The federal government has paid out $4.7 billion in subsidies this year. The administration said last week that most people would be able to renew subsidized coverage without filing an application and without going back to HealthCare.gov.

In June of 2009, the doctor and writer Atul Gawande published a piece in The New Yorker called “The Cost Conundrum,” which examined why the small border city of McAllen, Tex., was the most expensive place for health care in the United States.
The article became mandatory reading in the White House. President Obama convened an Oval Office meeting to discuss its key finding that the high cost of health care in the country was directly tied to a system that rewarded the overuse of care. The president also brought up the article at a meeting with Democratic senators, emphasizing that McAllen represented the problem that needed to be fixed.
Five years later, the situation has changed. Where McAllen once illustrated the problem of American health care, the city is now showing us how the problem can be solved, largely because of the Affordable Care Act that Mr. Obama signed into law in 2010.
In his article, Dr. Gawande cited studies showing that patients in high-cost areas like the Rio Grande Valley, which includes McAllen, were much less likely to receive preventive services like cancer screenings or vaccines, but far more likely to be prescribed costly drugs, invasive procedures and expensive diagnostic tests. And they were not any healthier for it: Compared with places like El Paso, McAllen had worse health outcomes, despite spending twice as much per capita on Medicare.
The problem was that doctors in McAllen were responding to reimbursement incentives in the American health care system that rewarded activity rather than value. The more procedures and visits a doctor billed, the more he got paid.
The Affordable Care Act was designed to change that. One of its provisions created the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which rewards doctors for keeping their patients healthy. Participation in the program requires primary care doctors to create networks, called accountable care organizations, or A.C.O.s, to better coordinate patient care. These networks are reimbursed for delivering high-quality care below a baseline of historical Medicare costs.
In 2012, doctors in McAllen formed the Rio Grande Valley Accountable Care Organization Health Providers, and signed up for this experiment. The early results are in, and they are stunning: From April 2012 to the end of 2013, the Rio Grande Valley A.C.O. saved more than $20 million from its Medicare baseline.
(One of us, Farzad Mostashari, is the C.E.O. of Aledade, which works with primary care physicians to help them form A.C.O.s; the other, Bob Kocher, is a partner in the venture capital firm Venrock, an investor in Aledade. We are not involved in the Rio Grande Valley A.C.O.)
From the beginning, physicians in the Rio Grande Valley A.C.O. analyzed data from their electronic health records to identify — and then focus on — high-risk patients. Patients who couldn’t get to the office were visited at home; those who had trouble communicating with their doctors were given cellphones.
Preventive care became a central focus. Doctors advised patients about diet and lifestyle changes that could prevent future health problems, and developed personal care plans for patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Patients who had recently had a hospital stay were scheduled for rapid follow-up visits to make sure that their recoveries were on track.
These changes didn’t just save money; they also improved patients’ health. From 2012 to 2013, the number of patients achieving control of their diabetes rose 11.8 percentage points. The number receiving vaccinations rose 12.2 percentage points.
This is not an isolated case. Today, more than 5.3 million Medicare beneficiaries nationwide are served by more than 360 A.C.O.s, which have helped hold spending hundreds of millions of dollars below Medicare targets for this period. Many primary care physicians — who are responsible for directing the vast majority of health care costs — are forming A.C.O.s, and more private health plans are setting up these reimbursement structures as well.
A continued slowing of health care cost growth will owe a good deal to this revolution in how we pay for medical care. It is a transformation that was sparked by the Affordable Care Act, and is now being played out throughout the country — even in the little Texas city of McAllen.

Gelot says that little has frustrated him more than the digital record system he installed a few years ago.
The problem: His system, made by one company, cannot share patient records with the local medical center, which uses a program made by another company.
The two companies are quick to deny responsibility, each blaming the other.
Regardless of who is at fault, doctors and hospital executives across the country say they are distressed that the expensive electronic health record systems they installed in the hopes of reducing costs and improving the coordination of patient care — a major goal of the Affordable Care Act — simply do not share information with competing systems.
The issue is especially critical now as many hospitals and doctors scramble to install the latest versions of their digital record systems to demonstrate to regulators starting Wednesday that they can share some patient data. Those who cannot will face reductions in Medicare reimbursements down the road.
On top of that, leading companies in the industry are preparing to bid on a Defense Department contract valued at an estimated $11 billion. A primary requirement is that the winning vendor must be able to share information, allowing the department to digitally track the medical care of 9.6 million beneficiaries around the globe.
The contract is the latest boon to an industry that taxpayers have heavily subsidized in recent years with over $24 billion in incentive payments to help install electronic health records in hospitals and physicians’ offices.
While most providers have installed some kind of electronic record system, two recent studies have found that fewer than half of the nation’s hospitals can transmit a patient care document, while only 14 percent of physicians can exchange patient data with outside hospitals or other providers.
“We’ve spent half a million dollars on an electronic health record system about three years ago, and I’m faxing all day long. I can’t send anything electronically over it,” said Dr. William L. Rich III, a member of a nine-person ophthalmology practice in Northern Virginia and medical director of health policy for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
Dr. Gelot, the ear, nose and throat specialist, uses a system made by Practice Fusion. His local medical center, Vidant Roanoke-Chowan Hospital, relies on a program built by Epic Systems.
There is no evidence that either company does a better or worse job of sharing information. But Epic and its enigmatic founder, Judith R. Faulkner, are being denounced by those who say its empire has been built with towering walls, delberately built not to share patient information with competing systems.
Almost 18 months after an Epic system was installed at UnityPoint Health-St. Luke’s hospital in Sioux City, Iowa, physicians there still cannot transmit a patient care document to doctors two miles south at Mercy Medical Center, which uses a system made by another major player in the field, the Cerner Corporation.
Where interconnectivity between systems does occur, it often happens with steep upfront connecting charges or recurring fees, creating what some see as a digital divide between large hospital systems that have money and technical personnel and small, rural hospitals or physician practices that are overwhelmed, financially and technologically.
The University of California Davis Health System has 22 specialists installing the technology so that doctors can share patient data between its Epic system and other internal systems, like the hemodynamic monitors in its critical care unit, or with some non-Epic systems outside the hospital.
“We’re a huge organization, so we can absorb those costs,” said Michael Minear, the chief information officer at the U.C. Davis Health System. “Small clinics and physician offices are going to have a harder time.”
Separately, through its maintenance contracts and other agreements, Epic charges a fee to send data to some non-Epic systems.
Epic is not alone in charging various fees, nor is there evidence that its fees are more expensive than its peers. But the barrier created by these types of charges “affects the small and rural providers much more significantly,” Morgan Honea, executive director of the Colorado Regional Health Information Organization, a public health information exchange, said in recent policy hearings in Washington.
While nearly all of the leading companies in this area have come under fire for their inability to easily share information, Epic faced some of the strongest attacks this summer.
A research report from the RAND Corporation described Epic as a “closed” platform that made it “challenging and costly for hospitals” to interconnect with the clinical or billing software of other companies. Shortly after, Representative Phil Gingrey, a Georgia Republican and a doctor, assailed the company in public hearings in Washington for the same shortfalls.
Executives at Epic rejected the criticism, labeling it as “vendors throwing smoke screens,” but for the first time, the company hired a Washington lobbying firm to improve its image.
Epic argues that its customers — some of the biggest hospitals in the country — share more records than any other. In interviews with nearly 200 providers for a study that will be released in early October, executives at the research firm Klas said Epic’s scores were “as good or better than most of the other vendors” in its ability to share information with other systems.
Moreover, at the request of Epic executives, several customers, including the Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles, the Yale New Haven Health System, and New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital, sent emails to The New York Times saying they were able to share records through Epic.
A sort of Microsoft of the Midwest, built on a sprawling campus on nearly 1,000 acres of farmland near Madison, Wis., the privately held Epic has emerged as a leader in the race to digitize patient medical records. Its systems hold the health records of nearly half the country.
The explosion in demand under the technology incentive plan has been a windfall for Epic. Ms. Faulkner is estimated to be worth $2.3 billion.
In a rare interview, Ms. Faulkner said the industry made great strides this year and noted that Epic’s customers were sending increasing numbers of records each month.
She and other company executives argued that the company was actually one of the first to create rules around sharing information and a platform to do so.
In 2005, when it became clear to her that the government was not prepared to create a set of rules around interoperability, Ms. Faulkner said, her team began writing the code for Care Everywhere. Initially seen as a health information exchange for its own customers, Care Everywhere today connects hospitals all over the country as well as to various public health agencies and registries.
“Let’s say a patient is coming from U.C.L.A. and going to the University of Chicago, an Epic-to-Epic hospital. Boom. That’s easy,” Ms. Faulkner said. “These are hospitals that have agreed to the Rules of the Road, a legal contract, that says the other organization is going to take good care of the data.”
Careful in her choice of words, Ms. Faulkner offered muted criticism of regulators for, essentially, failing to create what she did — a contract to help providers connect to one another and a way to authenticate that only the correct person could view the patient information.
“I’m not sure why the government doesn’t want to do some of the things that would be required for everybody to march together,” she said.
Regulators responded that interoperability was a “top priority” and that they recently set out a 10-year vision and agenda to achieve it, in an emailed statement from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.
The office’s spokesman added that achieving interoperability “requires stakeholders to come together and agree on policy-related issues like who can access information and for what purpose.”
Dr. Gelot says he hopes interoperability comes sooner rather than later.
“The systems can’t communicate, and that becomes my problem because I cannot send what is required and I’m going to have a 1 percent penalty from Medicare,” Dr. Gelot said. “They’re asking me to do something I can’t control.”

Among them, health officials said, are the four people who shared an apartment with the patient, Thomas E. Duncan, and medical workers who treated him. Another 40 people are being monitored daily but are considered at relatively low risk, officials said. No one has developed any symptoms of the disease.
For those who have been exposed to the virus, there is nothing to do but wait.
“There really isn’t anything that can be done to prevent Ebola from developing if infection has occurred,” said Beth P. Bell, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
While officials said the risk of the disease spreading widely were minimal, they warned that others might fall ill. “There certainly is a possibility that some of the people who have been in close contact with the patient might get sick with Ebola,” Dr. Bell said.
The first signs of the illness often appear within eight to 10 days, but can take as long as 21 days.
Mr. Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia on Sept. 20. Ebola cannot be spread until a person is symptomatic, and Mr. Duncan told doctors he first felt ill on Sept. 24. As he became sicker, the amount of virus in his system increased, and so did the risk of contagion.
Anyone who came into contact with him between Sept. 24 and Sept. 28, when he was placed in isolation at the hospital, is considered at risk of infection.
The four people who shared an apartment with Mr. Duncan before he was hospitalized remained in quarantine on Friday, and Texas officials apologized to them both for their failure to communicate and for not moving more quickly to have the apartment cleaned of possibly infectious materials.
After much delay, the cleanup began at the Ivy Apartments Friday afternoon as workers in yellow protective suits scoured the property, taking any item that might harbor the virus, which can survive outside the body for several hours on hard surfaces and for several days in pools of fluid. At least two of the contractor’s trucks were parked outside of Apartment 614, where Mr. Duncan had been staying. The green trucks were brightly painted and had advertising slogans on them, including “Cleaning Guys, Haz-Mat Clean-Up” and “The Annihilator.”
The top elected official in Dallas County, County Judge Clay Jenkins, said he visited the family on Thursday night to apologize. He said that they were understandably scared and confused, and that he hoped to find them more comfortable accommodations.
“I want to see them treated as I would want my own family treated,” Mr. Jenkins said.
The disease centers and the Department of Transportation have different protocols for handling medical waste associated with diseases such as Ebola, which led to a greater delay in getting the apartment cleaned.
Kasey Bonner, the coordinator for the Cleaning Guys, the company hired by C.D.C. to do the job, said its workers were not allowed to enter the apartment on Thursday night because the company did not have permission to transport hazardous material on Texas highways.
“We were contracted to clean and contain the affected material and anything that has come in contact with that patient,” Ms. Bonner said “There was no protocol put in place for handling Ebola on Texas highways.”
She said that the problem had been resolved and that they were in the process of cleaning the home.
The confusion was indicative of the myriad local, state and federal protocols and levels of preparedness that have raised questions about the ability of the nation’s health care infrastructure to handle an epidemic.
“There are many, many problems that have been revealed by this single case,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University.
Among the mistakes was the failure in communication at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital when Mr. Duncan first arrived showing symptoms of Ebola on Sept. 25. While both Mr. Duncan and the person who brought him to the hospital told the nurse in the emergency room that he had been in Liberia, the center of the Ebola epidemic, that information was not relayed to the diagnostic team.
Without that crucial information, doctors sent Mr. Duncan home. He returned three days later, critically ill. He was then placed in isolation, where he remains in serious but stable condition.
In a statement released late Thursday, the hospital sought to explain early missteps and said it was going to integrate its electronic record keeping system to prevent such failures of communication.
“Protocols were followed by both the physician and the nurses,” the hospital said. “However, we have identified a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records interacted in this specific case. In our electronic health records, there are separate physician and nursing work flows.”
They promised to blend those work flows and said the system is being “modified to specifically reference Ebola-endemic regions in Africa.”
The effectiveness of the electronic record keeping system varies widely in hospitals and health care systems across the country, in part because the new systems are often layered on older systems and are not integrated. For instance, according to health experts, a hospital may create one electronic system for billing, another one for X-rays and lab tests and yet another for the diagnostic team. Some hospitals have been more aggressive than others in integrating these systems.
But Dr. Redlener said that anyone working in the hospital should have been aware that the information gathered by the nurse doing triage was not automatically relayed to the doctors. And, he said, given the numerous C.D.C. alerts about Ebola and the intense media coverage of the disease, hospital employees should have been especially alert to any symptomatic patient who had traveled recently from West Africa
“Right now,” he said, “with this unbelievable focus on Ebola, that someone would not get up and say, ‘I have a possible Ebola here’ — it is impossible for any hospital in the U.S. not to be acutely aware of Ebola and what needs to happen.”

Some wore gowns that left their necks uncovered and haphazardly applied surgical tape to the bare spots. And it was two days after the Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted before personnel began wearing biohazard suits.
For Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the last two and a half weeks have been a nightmare without end. And with the announcement early Wednesday that a second nurse who cared for Mr. Duncan had been infected, scrutiny of the hospital intensified as officials sought to calm both workers and patients.
Long regarded as one of the finest hospitals in Texas, Presbyterian has faced continuing criticism — first for its initial misdiagnosis of Mr. Duncan, which delayed his care and placed others at risk; then for issuing contradictory statements about why its doctors did not suspect Ebola; and now for failures in safety protocol that led to the infections of two of its own. If the hospital has served as a canary in a coal mine for the country’s Ebola response, the results have not inspired confidence.
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who has received his own measure of criticism for the C.D.C.’s response, seemed to acknowledge as much on Wednesday when he described some of the hospital’s lapses. He also announced that the second nurse would be flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has successfully treated two American Ebola patients in one of the country’s four special biocontainment units.
The C.D.C. flooded Presbyterian this week with teams of infection-control experts and crisis managers. “We’re working very closely with the hospital in Dallas to promote a safe environment for the care of everyone at that hospital, for the patients and for the workers,” Dr. Frieden said.
Until three weeks ago, few questioned Presbyterian’s status. With nearly 900 beds and 1,000 doctors, it is the eighth-largest hospital in Texas and has excelled in delivering both cardiac care and babies: more than 5,000 births a year. Regular evaluations by Medicare and the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, have largely been sterling.
Known here as Presby, it is the hospital of choice for some of the region’s richest and most prominent residents. The maternity wing is named for Margot Perot, the wife of the technology magnate and former presidential candidate Ross Perot. The board chairwoman at the hospital’s parent company, Texas Health Resources, is Anne T. Bass, the wife of the billionaire investor Robert M. Bass.
Its supporters question whether any hospital would have performed much better under similar circumstances: the unannounced arrival in its emergency room of the first Ebola case to be diagnosed in the United States. But local officials agree that Presbyterian’s reputation has taken a pounding, and that it will take time to repair it.
“I’m sure it has suffered,” said Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s top elected official. “It has had a great reputation as a great hospital.”
Things may get worse before they get better at the massive complex of blond brick buildings. Health care officials have started to express concern that the hospital’s staff, particularly its nurses, may stay away from their jobs, and the company has already had to recruit nurses and volunteers from other hospitals to meet heightened staffing demands. On Wednesday morning, the hospital’s gleaming hallways and teak-paneled waiting rooms were eerily quiet.
“It has always been considered the Neiman Marcus of hospitals, because a lot of wealthy people came here,” Suzanne Worthing said while waiting, virtually alone, for her husband to have an ultrasound. “Now we wonder if it’s going to become the J. C. Penney.”
Ms. Worthing said that one of her children had been delivered at Presbyterian, and that she and other family members saw doctors there regularly. But she acknowledged that she and her husband had thought twice about keeping Wednesday’s appointment.
“We thought about not having it done,” she said. “It’s the Ebola epicenter.”
There has been no comprehensive investigation to date of the hospital’s missteps, and health officials remain uncertain about precisely how the two young nurses, Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Joy Vinson, 29, were exposed. But the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Texas Department of State Health Services are evaluating the hospital’s performance.
Dr. Frieden said that workers had followed an evolving set of protocols to protect themselves in the first days after Mr. Duncan’s hospitalization. Some, he said, donned three or four layers of protective equipment and closed openings with tape in the belief that it would afford greater safety.
“In fact, by putting on more layers of gloves or other protective clothing, it becomes much harder to put them on, it becomes much harder to take them off, and the risk of contamination during the process of taking these gloves off is much higher,” he said.
Some nurses have said they received inadequate and ever-changing guidance on proper techniques.
Dr. Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer at Texas Health Resources, said in an interview Wednesday that workers had not started wearing full biohazard suits until two days after Mr. Duncan was admitted, when tests confirmed that he had Ebola. He said that until then, the hospital had been following C.D.C. protocols to wear masks, gloves, gowns and shields.
Hospital officials have generally kept their remarks to a minimum, issuing brief statements and appearing at only a few of the nearly daily news conferences here. Some of their statements have included inaccurate dates for Mr. Duncan’s treatment. After first saying the hospital had failed to diagnose his Ebola infection on Sept. 25 because a doctor had not seen electronic medical records prepared by a nurse, officials later said that had not been the case.
On Friday, the hospital hired Burson-Marsteller, the global public relations firm, to help tell its side.
Speaking at the news conference where Ms. Vinson’s infection was announced, Dr. Varga acknowledged that the hospital had made mistakes.
“We’re a hospital that may have done things different with the benefit of what we know today,” he said. “But make no mistake: No one wants to get this right more than our hospital, the first to diagnose and treat this insidious disease.”
In a subsequent interview, Dr. Varga explained how the hospital believed Mr. Duncan, who died last week, had been misdiagnosed. He said a nurse had not asked Mr. Duncan about his travel history, a key element of Ebola screening, until two hours after he arrived in the emergency room. The nurse noted, he said, that Mr. Duncan had come from West Africa, but did not communicate that to the doctor who re-interviewed Mr. Duncan 10 minutes later. The doctor somehow came away with different information, that Mr. Duncan was a local resident. Dr. Varga said he did not know how that had happened.
“We didn’t correctly diagnose Mr. Duncan’s initial symptoms, and we’re sorry about that,” he said. “It wasn’t the outcome we were hoping for.”
Dr. Varga denied that the infection of a second nurse suggested that the hospital had a systemic problem.
“Let’s be clear,” he said. “We’re a hospital that serves this community incredibly well, and we have for nearly half a century.”
Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas opened as a faith-based nonprofit in 1966 in what were then sparsely populated northern suburbs. In 1997, Texas Health Resources was formed by merging the hospital with others in Fort Worth and Arlington. The hospital’s most recent tax filings, from 2012, show that it had $613 million in revenue and $1.1 billion in net assets. The hospital’s president at the time was paid $1.1 million.
In Medicare’s most recent ratings, the hospital scored well on surgery, obstetrics, and cardiac and stroke care. But it did less well, below state and national averages, on assessments of its emergency department. For instance, it took an average of 52 minutes for an emergency patient to be seen by a doctor or nurse, twice the state and national averages.
Court records also reveal several recent cases of bad outcomes in the emergency room. In 2012, for instance, one of the hospital’s own doctors, Rachel Dunagin, showed up at the emergency room with breathing problems. The lawsuit she later filed, which was dismissed after an out-of-court resolution, charged that a nurse had caused nerve damage and a permanent disability while inserting an IV line.
Another patient, Dwain Williams, said in a telephone interview that he had gone to the emergency room in July 2013 after coughing up blood. Records provided by Mr. Williams and evaluated by doctors consulted by The New York Times show that the hospital failed to determine that he had tuberculosis and sent him home with antibiotics, as was the case on Mr. Duncan’s first visit. Mr. Williams, who was insured by Medicare, received a correct diagnosis two weeks later in Los Angeles, but only after exposing family members and airplane passengers.
“It kind of felt like they were just rushing me in and out,” Mr. Williams said.

In addition, the officials said, consumers should update information on their income and family size and should compare their current insurance with alternatives, which could offer better coverage at a lower cost.
Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal marketplace, said the notices were being sent to 7.3 million people enrolled in health plans purchased through the exchange, HealthCare.gov, which serves three dozen states. Mr. Counihan, speaking at a conference of insurance executives and consumer advocates, outlined what he described as five easy steps for consumers.
“Step 1 — review your coverage,” Mr. Counihan said. “Plans change, people change. Step 2 — starting Nov. 15, log in and update your application. Make sure your household income and other information is up-to-date. Step 3 — compare your current plan with other plans that are available in your area. Step 4 — choose the health plan that best fits your budget and health needs. Step 5 — enroll.” The open enrollment period runs from Nov. 15 through Feb. 15. But, Mr. Counihan said, “for coverage starting Jan. 1, the consumer must enroll in a health plan by Dec. 15.”
Consumers who have already signed up and who take no action will, in most cases, have coverage automatically renewed in the same or similar health plans. Federal subsidies will also be the same, though premiums are likely to change, and consumers will not always be able to stay with their current doctors because health plans can change their provider networks.
“There is going to be a lot of confusion,” said Rachel Klein, director of the enrollment program at Families USA, a consumer group. But she said, “The uninsured want health insurance and will persevere to get it.”
Insurers expressed concern about consumers who choose to leave one health plan and sign up for another offered by a different insurance company. The federal government is not planning to send a notice to the first insurer terminating the consumer’s enrollment. As a result, consumers may receive bills or invoices from both companies. And conceivably, insurers said, if premiums are paid from bank accounts by electronic funds transfer, the money could be deducted twice.
Katie Dzurec-Dunton, the director of compliance and regulatory affairs at Maine Community Health Options, the state’s most popular plan on the exchange, said she worried that “we will get no notification of any kind” in these cases. Insurers will hesitate to shut off coverage for consumers if the companies do not receive explicit instructions to do so, she said. Mr. Counihan said the renewal process would work well for most consumers, but might not be “perfect for every enrollment transaction.”
Aaron Albright, a spokesman at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that insurers would not receive termination notices, but could assume that an individual’s coverage ends on Dec. 31 unless the insurer is told otherwise by the government. In late December, the federal marketplace will send enrollment files to insurers indicating whose coverage has been renewed for 2015.
Esther Krofah, a health-policy specialist at the National Governors Association, voiced another concern. “Consumers,” she said, “will receive multiple notices from the marketplace and insurers and will need to pay careful attention to the complex messages.” The notices could differ because enrollment records kept by insurers and the government differ in many particulars.
The Obama administration began notifying insurers this week of its preliminary decisions to approve health plans for sale in the federal marketplace this fall. But insurers cannot begin sending renewal notices to customers until they receive signed contracts from the government in November. This conflicts with rules and laws in some states, which require insurers to inform consumers two or three months before the renewals take effect on Jan. 1.
Paul D. Wingle, the exchange strategy chief at Aetna, asked federal officials how to reconcile the federal and state requirements. Michael Adelberg, a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that federal officials were in discussions with state insurance regulators and would probably issue guidance on the question.

But almost as surprising was how difficult it was during my reporting for Mr. Drier to extract his own records from the hospital.
He wanted a copy because he enjoys adventurous travel and he needed a record of the surgery in case of injury; I wanted to see the chart to make sure nothing unusual had occurred in the operating room that might justify the enormous bill. Hospitals are computerized, and patients have a right to their own records, so I assumed getting the chart would be easy.
I was wrong. The six-week ordeal included requests that needed to be made via regular mail, numerous phone calls, consent forms and an estimate for copying fees that totaled $100. This was topped off by an actual visit to the hospital by Mr. Drier, who sat in an office until he had paper documents in hand.
In a digital age when we can transfer money to purchase a house online or view a college transcript by logging on to a secure website, why is it so often difficult for patients to gain access to their medical data? And who controls our health information?
“You should be able to walk into a provider’s office and say, ‘I want a copy’ — you are legally entitled to that,” said I. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, noting that there were only a few exceptions, such as for prisoners. But the reality is that many hospitals and doctors have created a series of hurdles that must be cleared before patients can get their information. And many of those hurdles, experts say, are based on the economics of medicine.
“The medical record is held hostage,” Professor Cohen said. “The reason is often to keep a customer or keep a patient from leaving the practice.”
Some providers contend that releasing information might somehow compromise patient privacy and confidentiality concerns laid out in Hipaa, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. But that legislation was created at the dawn of the Internet era, when there were worries that sensitive health information that could embarrass patients or leave them vulnerable to discrimination would be too freely accessible. Internet security systems have greatly improved, and it is no longer legal for insurers to reject applicants for pre-existing conditions.
“When hospitals talk about Hipaa or charge for releasing records what they’re really saying is, ‘I don’t want to do this and I have to find an excuse,’ ” said Dr. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, who was previously President Obama’s national health information technology coordinator. “Hipaa is used in all sorts of distorted ways, because ‘protecting privacy’ sounds good.”
This summer, for example, Michael Madrid, 47, a software developer in New York City, saw an orthopedist because of knee pain and was sent for an M.R.I. When he called the office for results he was told he had to come in to get them, to protect his “privacy.” The scan showed a small ligament tear that required no treatment, and Mr. Madrid was billed $170 for a second visit.
He complained to the doctor and the hospital and on Yelp. He asked the Department of Health and Human Services about Hipaa concerns, which said there were none. “It was a huge inconvenience,” he said. “I had no privacy issues. This was irrelevant. They could have put my M.R.I. on Twitter and Facebook.”
A better flow of information would benefit both patients and the health care system as a whole, Dr. Blumenthal said. If patients possess their records they can choose and move their care at will, picking doctors and testing sites that are cheaper or more to their liking. Likewise, if records can be transmitted with the ease of emails, doctors in different locations can better dispense treatment, avoiding the need to repeat tests. On a larger scale, the release of data that is now trapped in hundreds of hospital systems and thousands of doctors’ offices is crucial for researchers, Dr. Blumenthal said. They could use it to identify trends in overuse or unrealized side effects. (For research purposes, the data can easily be released in a way to protect patients’ identities.) “The nation is on a journey toward more accessibility,” Dr. Blumenthal said, though it still has “a long way to go.”
Linda E. Fishman, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said that while the organization supported patients’ rights to their information, providing it was not always simple. “Responding to requests is more difficult than it should be,” she said, because “the entire health care system has one foot in the paper world and the other in the electronic world.” She added that the consequences of violating patient privacy laws were “severe.” Already a few major health systems have been slowly dismantling the firewall between patients and their data. For example, Kaiser Permanente in California, Partners Health in Boston and the Cleveland Clinic allow patients to log on to secure websites to view their test results and other medical information.
Government mandates, meanwhile, are laying the groundwork for more sharing. Legislation passed in 2009 prods hospitals and doctors’ offices to convert to electronic records, a changeover that officials estimate is more than 80 percent complete. But the next step requires health providers to show they are using that capability to begin better sharing medical information with patients and one another. That will begin to phase in next year.
BUT resistance is likely to be fierce from some corners, since sharing data goes against hospitals’ and doctors’ financial interests when they are jockeying to hold on to patients in a competitive market. The more health care providers restrict the release of records and lab results, the harder it will be for patients to leave. And the companies that design electronic medical record software also don’t want patients to leave their orbit, any more than the makers of P.C.s want to facilitate a move to a Mac.  In fact, Professor Cohen said, many programs are built so that they cannot share information with one another.
Although doctors and hospitals legally own their medical charts, patients have a right to have access in a timely manner — Hipaa requires a response within 30 days of a patient request — and at a reasonable processing cost. In the end, Mr. Drier spent six weeks trying to obtain the paper record of his back surgery — though he would have preferred a digital copy. That may or may not have exceeded the 30-day deadline stipulated by law, depending on how the days are counted. But is that “reasonable” in an age when most information is available with the click of a mouse?

That may be changing.","When the 48-year-old man from Oregon didn’t have insurance, he felt he had no place to go but the emergency room. The man, who has diabetes, went to the emergency room often when he suffered from kidney stones. “Emergency rooms, from what I understand, they can never turn you away,” he said. “I mean, you don’t have much options when you don’t have insurance.”
Then, when he enrolled in the state of Oregon’s Medicaid plan, that all changed. He started seeing doctors in their offices, and stayed away from the emergency room: “I have had five appointments with my primary, one with the diabetic because they had me go to a diabetic educator, and then an appointment with my pharmacist, and then he does a phone-in thing with me every two weeks.”
His experience confirms common assumptions about how health care works. If we can just invest in preventive care, we can reduce the use of the emergency room and lower health care costs, the thinking goes. But it turns out that his experience wasn’t typical. He was part of a giant social policy experiment that randomly assigned some eligible people to get Medicaid and others to remain uninsured. Over all, the study found that people who got insurance actually used the emergency room more than their uninsured peers.
Collecting data that can trump a powerful anecdote is the value of the randomized controlled trial, says Amy Finkelstein, an M.I.T. professor and a leader of the Oregon study, which has published a series of papers, most recently on emergency room use.
That’s why this type of study — which randomly assigns some people to a new treatment and others to a placebo or an old approach — is the gold standard in evaluating the effectiveness of drugs: It can provide results that are both surprising and persuasive. But despite medical science’s long history with such studies, when it comes to the best way to design health care delivery, the randomized evaluation is still an incredibly rare approach.
That may be starting to change.
Ms. Finkelstein is trying to help researchers find rigorous ways to evaluate new approaches to the health delivery system — questions about what sorts of services to offer different patients, financing methods for care, or other such questions. In a recent review of major medical journals, she found that more than 80 percent of published papers on medical interventions, like drugs and operations, involved randomized trials. Fewer than 20 percent of studies about how to actually practice medicine used randomized groups of patients or doctors.
Dr. Jeffrey Brenner runs a medical practice in Camden, N.J., that serves the extremely sick patients who tend to cost the health care system a lot of money. His approach, which focuses on extensive social services and one-on-one medical care for these costly patients, has received accolades and glowing press coverage. But Dr. Brenner said he can’t really be sure his approach works without testing it, since he knows that many of the sickest patients in a given year would probably get better even without all that extra help. He has recently teamed with Ms. Finkelstein and her colleagues at M.I.T.'s J-PAL North America group to set up a system for randomizing possible patients and tracking their outcomes over time.
“We have these one-off stories of the miracle cure, and now we have to test it,” he said. “The only way to know if our intervention is truly effective is to do a randomized trial.”
Randomized controlled trials are increasingly popular in designing international development programs overseas, and trials have been used in the United States to see if policies increase voter turnout or improve homelessness assistance. They have a long history in fields like employment training.
But there has been less appetite for using them in health care settings. Sometimes, the hesitation is because of ethical considerations: If we think we know a certain approach will be better, should we really withhold an intervention from some people?
Sometimes it’s just practically and politically difficult to design trials, measure the results and wait all that time to know whether a given strategy achieves its goals. Dr. Brenner’s trial, for example, will take more than two years to complete. If policy makers or hospital administrators can get approval for a sensible sounding change, they often prefer to adopt it right away.
“Doctors who insist on randomized controlled trials for whether they’ll use drug X are a little lackadaisical on the more important sort of questions,” said Peter Orszag, a former budget director for President Obama who is now a Citigroup vice president. He has been advocating the use of more random evaluations in health delivery. Possibilities include studying how long women should stay in the hospital after cesarean sections, or exploring whether health insurers should charge higher co-payments for doctors who provide low-quality care.
The Oregon study shows the dangers of policy making by gut instinct. For years, advocates of expanded health insurance coverage have been fond of saying that insurance coverage is a surefire way to reduce health care spending, figuring that prevention is cheaper than treating medical emergencies. President Obama leaned heavily on such rhetoric in selling the Affordable Care Act.
The study also countered some conventional wisdom among Medicaid’s critics. It turned out that the people who got coverage did have much better access to the care they needed than peers who relied on free clinics and other charity care. (The study had some limitations, too. It turned out to have too small a sample to answer questions about whether Medicaid led to improvements in key measures of health.)
Another randomized study surprised experts: one that looked at offering treatment to relieve suffering for people with advanced lung cancer. It turned out, as expected, that people who chose so-called palliative care had a better quality of life than those who got the usual care. But it also turned out that the patients who got palliative care lived longer.
Some people in health care are starting to become interested in the approach. The wide use of electronic health records is making it easier to track patients without a lot of additional record-keeping. New payment strategies from Medicare and private insurance companies are increasing pressure on hospitals to lower costs, and that may create incentives for them to study the most efficient ways to care for their patients.
Dr. Jeremy Boal, the medical director at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, said his organization was about to start a series of trials to see if its ideas for delivering better and cheaper care would really work.
“Everyone is going to be realizing that the tools we’ve used in the past on the health care delivery side aren’t really up to the task,” he said. “We’re going to have to find new approaches.”

But researchers are increasingly finding the term useful in understanding another destructive, and distinctly American, phenomenon — mass incarceration. This four-decade binge poses one of the greatest public health challenges of modern times, concludes a new report released last week by the Vera Institute of Justice.
For many obvious reasons, people in prison are among the unhealthiest members of society. Most come from impoverished communities where chronic and infectious diseases, drug abuse and other physical and mental stressors are present at much higher rates than in the general population. Health care in those communities also tends to be poor or nonexistent.
The experience of being locked up — which often involves dangerous overcrowding and inconsistent or inadequate health care — exacerbates these problems, or creates new ones. Worse, the criminal justice system has to absorb more of the mentally ill and the addicted. The collapse of institutional psychiatric care and the surge of punitive drug laws have sent millions of people to prison, where they rarely if ever get the care they need. Severe mental illness is two to four times as common in prison as on the outside, while more than two-thirds of inmates have a substance abuse problem, compared with about 9 percent of the general public.
Common prison-management tactics can also turn even relatively healthy inmates against themselves. Studies have found that people held in solitary confinement are up to seven times more likely than other inmates to harm themselves or attempt suicide.
The report also highlights the “contagious” health effects of incarceration on the already unstable communities most of the 700,000 inmates released each year will return to. When swaths of young, mostly minority men are put behind bars, families are ripped apart, children grow up fatherless, and poverty and homelessness increase. Today 2.7 million children have a parent in prison, which increases their own risk of incarceration down the road.
If this epidemic is going to be stopped, the report finds, public health and criminal justice systems must communicate effectively with one another. That requires comprehensive electronic health records that can be shared among agencies, increasing the likelihood that those who leave prison with health problems will not fall through the cracks.
Better health outcomes also depend on giving newly released inmates a real chance to find jobs and housing. The report calls for the end of laws that keep punishing people after they have been released from prison, like denying public housing and food stamps to those with drug felony convictions.
Finally, the Affordable Care Act — which provides more coverage for mental illness and substance abuse, and expanded Medicaid for childless adults — is a big step in the right direction.
Like any epidemic, mass incarceration must be tackled at many different levels. It is an opportune time for such an approach, as states around the country are thinking more broadly, pulling back on harsh sentencing laws and focusing more on alternatives to incarceration. But the moment may not last long. Public health professionals should seize a unique opportunity to help guide criminal justice reform while they have the chance.

A medical technologist had complained of dangerous lapses in the prevention of infections. The inspectors planned to follow up.
But Teresa Gilbert, the technologist, said supervisors excluded her from meetings with the inspectors from the Joint Commission, an independent agency that accredits hospitals. “I was told my opinions were not necessary, nor were they warranted,” said Mrs. Gilbert, an infection-control specialist.
The review ended disastrously for Womack, one of 54 domestic and overseas military hospitals that serve more than three million active-duty service members, retirees and family members. The inspectors faulted infection prevention and many other aspects of care, putting the hospital’s accreditation under a cloud for months.
It was disastrous for Mrs. Gilbert, too. She said she was reprimanded for being an obstructionist, reduced to part-time hours, investigated for what she called trumped-up charges and transferred to a clerk’s job.
The message to Womack workers, she said, was clear: “You don’t go against us. If you do, we will get you.”
At any hospital, patient safety and quality of care depend on the willingness of medical workers to identify problems. The goal is for medical workers to be free to speak bluntly to — and about — higher-ups without being ignored or, worse, punished.
In interviews and email exchanges, many doctors, nurses and other medical workers said military hospitals fall short of that objective.
During an examination of military hospitals this year, The New York Times asked readers to recount their experiences via a private electronic portal. Among more than 1,200 comments were dozens from medical workers about how the system thwarted efforts to deliver superior care.
Physicians and nurses described in follow-up interviews how they were brushed off, transferred, investigated, passed over for promotion or fired after they pointed out problems with care.
Senior military health officials said they were working aggressively to instill a culture where complaints are welcomed and addressed.
“We want people to come forward,” Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho, the Army surgeon general, wrote in a statement. “We are committed to patient safety, we are committed to transparency, and there will be NO COMPROMISE.”
But hospital workers, both military and civilian, described compromise as routine. The nature of military medicine, they say, muddles the emphasis on patient safety and quality of care.
Military hospitals must train a combat-ready medical corps while treating fevers and delivering babies. The staffs are top-heavy with novices, and active-duty medical workers are constantly rotated. Experts say some hospitals are dangerously small.
The command structure is so rigid that a nurse can oversee a doctor because the nurse holds a higher military rank. Promotions often reward administrative deeds over medical performance. Legal accountability is diminished: Active-duty service members cannot sue for malpractice, and other patients can sue only the government, not individual doctors or nurses.
Military supervisors wield more power than civilian ones; they are authorized to enforce rules that govern even the size of earrings a doctor can wear. Stepping out of line can be perilous for subordinates: One former Army radiologist said her supervisor threatened to transfer her to an outpost so remote that the only housing was in trailers.
“In the military you are not taught to question; you are taught to obey. And that’s great on the battlefield,” said Bill Benham, until recently first sergeant of the hospital at Fort Knox in Kentucky. “But health care is another beast.”
Risk in Raising Concerns
An analysis of military hospital data by The Times this year found preventable errors are chronic and rates of complications, when measured, are high in two cornerstones of treatment, maternity care and surgery. The Times also found that hospitals routinely failed to investigate after patients died unexpectedly or suffered permanent harm.
The Pentagon’s own review, ordered in May by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, resulted in orders for improvements at almost every hospital. Pentagon officials said they were especially concerned by suggestions of a systemwide shortcoming: medical workers’ reluctance to identify problems.
More than a dozen physicians and nurses interviewed for this article said their own experiences illustrated why. Most insisted on anonymity for fear of further harm to their careers.
A former military surgeon at Womack said he was passed over for promotion after he said that his supervisor had failed to properly examine a patient who later died of cancer. A psychiatrist who worked at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio said her supervisor tried to oust her after she complained that residents were not properly supervised. A former anesthesiologist at San Antonio Military Medical Center said his supervisor initiated a review of his credentials after he questioned why she failed to insert a breathing tube in a patient who later died and why another doctor gave the wrong type of blood to a patient.
Dr. Russell Hicks, a psychiatrist, said Madigan Army Medical Center outside Tacoma, Wash., revoked his credentials this year after he identified serious flaws in a program to screen soldiers for post-traumatic stress. “I did what I knew, and I still know, was right, and they went after me,” he said. He has appealed the decision.
Asked about specific allegations of reprisal, General Horoho said officials had investigated and decided that some were not substantiated.
“When they were, we took appropriate action,” she said. She said that the law prohibited her from discussing individual cases and that extensive reviews protected physicians from unfair attacks on their credentials.
But few cases trigger such high-level scrutiny. Dr. Gayle Humm, an emergency room physician under contract at Evans Army Community Hospital in Colorado, said she refused to prescribe narcotic painkillers for patients she suspected were addicted. When some patients complained, her supervisor told her that “the only thing that mattered was that the numbers were affecting his promotion,” she said.
After Dr. Humm, a retired Army colonel with decades of medical experience, criticized the treatment of a surgical patient in 2010, she said, she was let go.
Months later, the hospital’s intensive care nurses gave a deputy commander the medical charts of patients they said had received substandard care.
One nurse who attended the meeting said he asked why Evans did not report and investigate “sentinel events” — cases in which patients had unexpectedly suffered serious harm or had died — as required. “We prefer to call them clinical mishaps,” he said he was told.
Mike Rodriguez, a second nurse, said he resigned in disgust after the complaints were ignored. The civilian hospital where he now works “is not perfect,” he said. “But I can assure you there is no covering up of gross negligence.”
At David Grant Medical Center in California, Danette Lebaron, a pediatrician there for seven years, also said she was frustrated. In 2009, after one infant died and others suffered what she called devastating outcomes, she and three other doctors urged the hospital commander in a four-page letter to close the labor and delivery unit.
“I wanted it on the record that I did everything I could to shut that place down,” said Dr. Lebaron, who has since left. “I was angry that active-duty women, including me, had to deliver our children in an unsafe hospital.”
“Basically, I was told that training residents was more important than patient safety,” she said.
In a statement, Maj. Gen. Mark Ediger, the Air Force deputy surgeon general, said the hospital “provides high-quality care to mothers and babies.”
The unit remains open.
‘Invaluable’ but Pushed Out
Serving the United States Military Academy at West Point, Keller Army Community Hospital occupies a special niche among military hospitals. But that prestige glosses over the ravages of age, reflected in power failures, water shut-offs and balky ventilation. Not long ago, staff members said, a sewage pipe burst in the ceiling of the nursery and waste poured down near the cribs, all of them, fortunately, empty.
Pentagon analysts have argued that Keller sees too few patients — on average, five a day, 11 births a month — to keep medical workers’ skills honed. This year, Army officials beat back a Pentagon recommendation to convert Keller to an outpatient clinic.
Col. Italo Bastianelli, 52, spent 15 years at Keller, most recently as head of the obstetrics and gynecology unit. For a decade, his evaluations were stellar: “Magnificent.” “Invaluable.” “Phenomenal.” “Absolutely outstanding.”
But in 2010, Dr. Bastianelli started complaining that patient safety was taking a back seat to demands to cut costs and fill more beds. Speaking on the condition of anonymity in interviews, five nurses who work or worked there echoed his complaints.
Dr. Bastianelli objected that women in labor were denied epidural anesthesia, violating ethics and policy. He complained that the intermittent lack of a general surgeon on call could be “disastrous” in an emergency. He warned against leaving the maternity ward short-handed and argued that surgery was routinely conducted at temperatures or humidity that increased the risk of infection, and filed a report when staff members moved surgical blood stocks off site during a December 2010 power outage — and then forgot to retrieve them when surgery resumed.
Maternity ward nurses were also upset. In October 2011, they told Dr. Beverly Land, the hospital’s commander, that it was irresponsible to assign them to care for patients in the emergency room or post-anesthesia unit without proper training.
About four months later, Dr. Bastianelli learned that Dr. Land had decided to transfer him. In a private meeting, he said in an interview, she questioned his competence and productivity despite signing two evaluations extolling his performance.
Dr. Land, now serving elsewhere, said she made quality of care the highest priority, welcomed input, and promptly addressed concerns. “At no time would we ever consider making a decision based on budget that would put the health or safety of our people at risk,” she said in a statement.
The Army inspector general’s office swiftly dismissed Dr. Bastianelli’s argument that he was a victim of retaliation, saying he was transferred because maternity cases had declined and the hospital needed “a fresh perspective.”
After a lifetime of treating patients, Dr. Bastianelli is now an administrator, working as deputy commander for clinical services at Fort Dix in New Jersey.
He said his trust in the system was gone. “Simply put, I was targeted because I wasn’t a ‘yes man’ and stood in the way,” he said.
“The Army surgeon general wants the medical staff to speak up about patient safety and quality concerns,” he said. “I spoke up and was retaliated against.”
“That sends a message,” he said.
Keller’s troubles persisted after his departure. In August, the inspector general concluded that while patient care met safety standards, the hospital staff was deeply frustrated. “Employees believed that violations of standards are overlooked and that regulations and safety requirements are not always followed or enforced, and some felt they would be ‘punished’ if they ‘make waves’ or raise issues counter to their leadership,” the report states.
Two months later, after a surprise inspection, the Joint Commission gave Keller 60 days to correct problems with infection prevention.
Whistle-Blowers Shunned
“Regardless of whether there is the reality of retribution, if there is a perception of one, that is going to stifle open discussion,” Vice Adm. Matthew L. Nathan, the Navy’s surgeon general, said in an interview. One way to counter that, he and other senior health officials said, is to publicly celebrate whistle-blowers’ courage.

It May Be Hard to Avoid With Health Lawâ€™s Medicare Cuts,54aa7cca38f0d80bc9594226,"subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, subject:Hospitals, subject:Medicare, subject:Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010), subject:Budgets and Budgeting",Upshot,0.0,None,"Hundreds of billions of dollars may be saved, but research suggests those cuts hurt patients.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/upshot/do-no-harm-it-may-be-hard-to-avoid-with-health-laws-medicare-cuts.html,1041,"Hundreds of billions of dollars may be saved, but research suggests those cuts hurt patients.","The Affordable Care Act made changes to government payments for Medicare services that are expected to save tens to hundreds of billions of dollars per year. This sounds like a good thing — and it very well may be — but only if those spending cuts don’t cause harm. Research suggests they just might.
As any business would, hospitals often respond to reduced revenue by cutting costs. They especially tend to cut back on staff, according to a number of researchers.
Reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals between 1996 and 2009 were nearly entirely offset by cuts to operating expenses, and predominantly to personnel, Chapin White and Vivian Wu reported in Health Services Research in 2013. In other work, also published in Health Services Research, Ms. Wu and Yu-Chu Shen found that hospitals responded to lower Medicare payments in part by reducing staff and length of stays.
On the other hand, a study by health economists from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management found that hospitals responded to the market collapse in 2008, which reduced revenue through depressed returns on investments, not by cutting staff but by trimming back in other specific areas, including advanced medical records and less profitable services like those for substance use treatment or those provided in trauma centers.
Such cuts by hospitals may harm quality of care. For example, recent work suggests that cutting length of stays increases mortality for heart attack patients and those with pneumonia. Other work, published recently in the journal Medical Care, suggests that an 11.5 percent decrease in nursing staff per 1,000 inpatient days (a standardized measure of staffing levels) could increase adverse events — such as deaths, infections and surgical complications — by 1.2 percent. In their study, Drs. Wu and Shen found higher heart attack mortality rates in hospitals that had experienced larger Medicare payment cuts and had cut spending, “particularly among registered nurses,” in response. For each 1 percent payment cut, heart attack mortality was 0.4 percent higher.
Similarly, a study by Richard Lindrooth and colleagues found higher mortality rates among those using hospital services with lower profits from Medicare payments. Yet another study found that hospitals in the most financial stress experienced higher mortality for some types of patients.
In short, history suggests that hospitals may respond to payment cuts and financial stress in ways that are detrimental to patients, though that is certainly not their intent.
The Affordable Care Act’s cut to Medicare is large. The main component is an estimated 1.1 percent cut each year in what it pays hospitals for the services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries. In 2010, the Medicare actuaries estimated that this cut alone would trim $113 billion from the program from 2010 to 2019, representing 20 percent of the net savings from Medicare included in the Affordable Care Act. By 2040, Medicare is predicted to pay hospitals half of what a private insurer would for the same services.
To provide the same level and quality of care for less, hospitals will have to become more productive in converting dollars into care. Specifically, they’ll need to become at least 1.1 percent more productive per year. Is this likely? There are two schools of thought — one forward-looking and one that considers the lessons of the past.
Looking back, history provides a guide of what we might expect. Though hospital productivity grew from 1990 to 2005, it never came close to growing at 1.1 percent per year. Some years it was negative: Hospitals did less with more. Other years it was positive, but never above about 0.5 percent per year.
Looking forward, the great hope for new hospital payment models included in the Affordable Care Act and promoted by some private insurers is that they will encourage cheaper care that is also better care: doing more with less.
The most prominent new payment model is the Accountable Care Organization, or A.C.O., which sets cost and quality targets for hospitals and other provider groups, and offers bonus payments if they meet them or threatens financial penalties if they don’t.
Other trends, like the increasing use of electronic medical records, could also help organizations maintain or improve quality. Prominent economists, including Peter Orszag, former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, and the Harvard health economist David Cutler are optimistic that new models of payment, new uses of information systems and new emphasis on quality will help organizations become more productive, improving care while reducing costs.
There are some encouraging, though limited, signs that they’re right. For example, analysis by Zirui Song in The New England Journal of Medicine of an A.C.O.-like initiative by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts — its “Alternative Quality Contract” — found that it was associated with spending reductions and improvements in quality after four years. Recently released evidence on cost savings and quality improvement among some Medicare A.C.O.s is also encouraging, though more rigorous analysis is still needed to draw strong conclusions. In an op-ed in The Times, Bob Kocher and Farzad Mostashari explained how the A.C.O. model may have helped providers in the high-cost city of McAllen, Tex., save money and improve care.
It’s also relevant that other aspects of the law increase hospital revenue. For instance, because of the expansion in health insurance, hospitals no longer have to provide as much free care to uninsured people, which helps their bottom lines.
As optimistic as some may be about the A.C.O. model and other changes that could enhance hospital productivity, it’s too soon to declare victory. We don’t know if new payment models will help hospitals become more productive in the long run. One thing we can say with some confidence, however, is that Congress is likely to return to Medicare as a source of fiscal savings. As Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, once said, Medicare is Congress’s “cash cow,” its go-to source for deficit reduction. This isn’t necessarily because Congress hates Medicare. But Medicare is a large and growing share of the budget and the main cause of projected deficits, so it’s naturally a target.
There’s no question that the Affordable Care Act is milking that cow. What remains to be seen is if patients pay a price.

These new payment models take many forms, but they all impose greater responsibility for cost control and quality improvement on providers and bear some resemblance to failed health care financing arrangements from the 1990s. However, there are some distinctions that could make all the difference.
A recently announced partnership that includes Anthem Blue Cross in California and seven Los Angeles-area hospital systems exemplifies these new models. Some have called “Anthem Blue Cross Vivity” (or just “Vivity”) bold and game-changing. It has characteristics of managed care plans more popular in the 1990s — like health maintenance organizations — as well as those of more modern accountable care organizations, or A.C.O.s. It has been characterized as both. What’s the difference?
As reported by my colleague Reed Abelson, the ambition of the new venture is to provide coordinated, high-quality care normally associated with big-name, integrated systems like Kaiser Permanente, Intermountain Healthcare and Geisinger Health System. Such systems are the inspiration for accountable care organizations, which vary in form but generally contract with Medicare, Medicaid or private insurers to provide integrated care for a large population of patients and can earn bonuses for meeting cost and quality targets or, in some cases, be penalized if they don’t.
Vivity is positioning itself as the antidote to high health-insurance premium growth in California, five times faster than inflation in recent years. It will team up with hospitals and doctors to provide coverage at 10 percent below the typical cost of a large-employer health plan by “aggressively manag[ing] care,” with little to no cost sharing, both characteristics of 1990s-style managed care. Vivity will also operate under a fixed, per-patient budget, called capitation, which was also a characteristic of some 1990s managed care plans. Participating providers must meet quality benchmarks (as yet unspecified), and Vivity’s partners will share in profits and losses, which are characteristics of accountable care organizations.
Vivity is not alone. In a recent commentary in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Zirui Song and David Chokshi described other initiatives by private insurers intended to control health spending by changing how they pay doctors and hospitals. One of them is Massachusetts Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s Alternative Quality Contract. With it, the insurer has contracted with 15 provider organizations to purchase care under prespecified budgets (with some protections so that providers aren’t at full risk for all costs) with quality-contingent bonuses. A recent survey of private health plans revealed that about 3 percent of their spending is under similar contractual arrangements. Some state Medicaid programs, in Illinois and  elsewhere, are also experimenting with accountable care organizations. And Medicare has initiated several A.C.O. payment models that organizations may voluntarily join.
Do accountable care organizations just offer H.M.O.-style managed care by another name? My colleague Rick Mayes, of the University of Richmond, and I addressed this question in a paper published in Health Affairs. We concluded that the accountable care organizations, by and large, are devised more in response to the shortcomings of H.M.O.s than as a copy of them.
Consider, as we did, capitation. One way to view the relationship between an insurer — whether a private company or a public program — and a health care provider (like a hospital or physician group) is the extent to which each bears the risk of health care costs. When care is more costly than expected, who pays the difference? Or, when care is cheaper, who pockets the profit? Capitation is at one extreme: It puts all the financial risk of care on providers because they get a fixed annual or monthly payment per patient no matter how much care the patient uses. This is better for insurers, since it provides budget certainty for them. Though risky for providers, capitation offers them greater incentive to manage care and its costs; but it raises the concern that they’ll economize by providing less care than patients require.
Contrast capitation with more typical financial arrangements in which insurers bear most or all of the risk of health care costs. When it began in 1965, Medicare — like most insurers at the time — paid doctors whatever cost they claimed, so long as it was “usual, customary and reasonable.” And Medicare originally paid hospitals their claimed costs plus a bit more, a built-in profit. If a patient used more care, the doctor or hospital got paid more and the insurer bore the extra cost.
Though Medicare and private insurers have since moved away from standards such as these, by and large they have not moved very far. Most health care policy experts point to this feature of health care in the United States as one of the major contributors to its growing costs.
An exception to this type of financing was the experiment with capitation in the 1990s. Its ascendance at that time was fueled in part by managed care organizations’ desire to limit financial exposure. By the end of the decade, about one-third of physicians had capitation contracts, accounting for 21 percent of their total revenue. However, many providers were unable to keep the cost of care below capitation rates and suffered large financial losses. Many survived only by growing larger, consolidating with other provider groups, gaining sufficient clout to negotiate more favorable terms with insurers, including getting out from under capitation entirely.
Capitation and H.M.O.s waned after the 1990s, but some think they’re coming back under the guise of accountable care organizations and that they will, therefore, suffer the same fate. That’s not quite right. Accountable care organizations are not H.M.O.s. As the Harvard health economist David Cutler wrote in his recent book, the latter are insurers that “dictate to doctors and patients what they are allowed to do and what they cannot,” which was a significant source of friction between patients and insurers in the 1990s. Accountable care organizations, in contrast, are providers that “decide on good care and work with patients to provide that care.” Another difference that improves the experience of Medicare patients is that Medicare accountable care organizations do not require beneficiaries to receive all their care within the organization for it to be reimbursed, as H.M.O.s typically would.
A.C.O.-like contracts typically do not rely on full capitation. Instead, they usually put providers at risk for a portion of the cost of care; that risk is shared with insurers, somewhat sidestepping a major financial challenge to providers under 1990s-style capitation. Another big difference is that 1990s H.M.O.s and capitation contracts didn’t require providers to meet quality targets to receive full payment. Today’s accountable care organizations tie bonus payments to quality, a feature intended to mitigate against providers sacrificing quality for lower cost. Finally, accountable care organizations are developing in a climate of far better information resources — electronic medical records and techniques for using the data they collect for quality measurement and improvement — than existed in the 1990s.
So, in a variety of ways, the design of accountable care organizations has evolved from that of capitation-based H.M.O.s. Nevertheless, both capitation and the accountable care organization model encourage providers to integrate. If accountable care organizations are able to use greater market clout to negotiate higher prices, they may not lead to the savings many hope for. Indeed, coinciding with the rise of accountable care organizations or in response to it, a growing number of hospitals have merged, integrated with physician groups or offered their own insurance products, among other types of alliances that increase market power.
The takeaway is this: New health care payment models have evolved from those that proved unsustainable in the past, but that doesn’t mean they’re guaranteed to be long-term successes. Vivity is not just the next H.M.O.

Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said the studies would help doctors decide which treatments would work best for which patients.
White House officials said the “precision medicine initiative” would begin with a down payment of $215 million in the president’s budget request for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
Precision medicine, also known as personalized or individualized medicine, “gives us one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs that we have ever seen,” Mr. Obama said at a White House event attended by patients’ advocates, researchers, and drug and biotechnology company executives.
Among those in the audience was Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, who said he intended to work with the president on the issue.
Mr. Obama said the new initiative could save lives, create jobs, foster new industries and help people overcome “the accidents and circumstances of our birth.”
“If we’re born with a particular disease, or a particular genetic makeup that makes us more vulnerable to something, that’s not our destiny, that’s not our fate,” Mr. Obama said. “We can remake it. That’s who we are as Americans, and that’s the power of scientific discovery.”
Federal officials described the project as a research consortium that would collect information from large numbers of people. The data could include medical records, laboratory test results, profiles of patients’ genes, and information about their diet, tobacco use, lifestyle and environment.
“We have been waiting for this for many, many years,” Dr. José Baselga, the chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said of the project. “We dreamed of this. We can mine the genome of tumors from our patients, identify mutations responsible for the tumors and accelerate improvements in patient care.”
The president’s budget request includes $130 million for the consortium, White House officials said. In addition, they said, Mr. Obama will request $70 million for the National Cancer Institute, the largest unit of the National Institutes of Health, to investigate genes that may contribute to the risk of developing certain types of cancer, and then to use that knowledge to develop more effective treatments.
Mr. Obama also plans to seek $10 million for the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the technology used to analyze DNA. Such analysis can identify millions of genetic variants, providing information that would help diagnose or treat some diseases, officials said.
The budget request also includes $5 million for health information technology so researchers can safely exchange data.
“We’re going to make sure that protecting patient privacy is built into our efforts from Day 1,” Mr. Obama said. “And I’m proud we have so many patients-rights advocates with us here today. They’re not going to be on the sidelines. This is not going to be an afterthought. They’ll help us design this initiative from the ground up, making sure that we harness the new technologies and opportunities in a responsible way.”
Since the 1990s, researchers have been collecting and storing human tissue and other biological specimens in repositories known as biobanks.
Jo Handelsman, the associate director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said of the president’s plan: “We do not envision this as being a biobank, which would suggest a single repository for all the data or all the samples. There are existing cohorts around the country that have already been started and have rich sources of data. The challenge in this initiative is to link them together and fill in the gaps.”
Dr. Collins said the initiative was feasible because of advances in genetics and cell biology, the use of electronic medical records, significant increases in computing power and a sharp decline over the last 15 years in the cost of a laboratory technique known as DNA sequencing. The technique is used to investigate the functions of genes and to analyze the full set of a person’s genes — the genome.
“It cost us $400 million for that first genome,” Dr. Collins said. “Now a genome can be sequenced for a cost approximating $1,000.”
Nancy A. Brown, the chief executive of the American Heart Association, said that patients with heart disease, like those with cancer, could benefit from precision medicine.
Her organization is compiling a database of genetic information. The data, she said, could help doctors tailor treatments for heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms, or find the right combination of drugs to lower high blood pressure.

Anthem, one of the country’s largest health insurers, said the hackers did not appear to have stolen information about its customers’ medical claims. But medical identification numbers were taken, along with Social Security numbers, addresses and email addresses, which could be used for medical fraud.
According to a federal database, many much smaller attacks across the country have included both medical records and financial information.
Medical identity theft has become a booming business, according to security experts, who warn that other health care companies are likely to be targeted as a result of the hackers’ success in penetrating Anthem’s computer systems. Hackers often try one company to test their methods before moving on to others, and criminals are becoming increasingly creative in their use of medical information, experts say.
“The industry has become, over the last three years, a much bigger target,” said Daniel Nutkis, the chief executive of the Health Information Trust Alliance, an industry group that works with health care organizations to improve their data security.
The publicity surrounding the breach, which exposed information on about 80 million people, is already generating phishing email scams, in which criminals posing as legitimate businesses try to persuade people to sign up for bogus credit protection services and provide personal information about themselves.
On Friday, Anthem sent out an alert to its customers warning them of the scam, which the company described as an “opportunistic” attempt to take advantage of news of the breach, but the company emphasized it had no evidence that the scam artists were the hackers.
The company, which operates under a series of Blue Cross plans in states like California, Connecticut and New York, is working with federal investigators to determine the source of the attack. Some signs continued to point to China, which has previously been thought to target health care companies, although the investigation is still in its early stages.
If Chinese hackers are responsible, it raises an immediate and hard-to-answer question: Are they acting on behalf of the government? Or are they independent actors, seeking to sell the information they have obtained?
The difference is a big one. The United States has already indicted five members of a People’s Liberation Army unit that is thought to be responsible for stealing intellectual property, usually designs from American and European companies. But the group is not known for stealing large amounts of personal information.
The key is the hackers’ motive. While they could be preparing to sell the information on the black market, they may also be searching for intelligence on government officials or senior executives who mask their personal information, but tend to provide real names and real numbers when dealing with health-related matters.
“The question is whether this is about espionage or theft,” said one government official who was briefed on the investigation.
As a rich source of personal information, health care organizations — like hospitals, doctors’ offices and insurers — are increasingly going to be vulnerable to attacks, according to security experts. “Anthem is not the last of these organizations,” said Cameron Camp, a researcher for ESET, which specializes in data security. “We’re going to see that style of attack again.”
Medical identify theft is on the rise, experts say, because it pays. In black-market auctions, complete patient medical records tend to fetch higher prices than credit card numbers. One security expert said that at one auction a patient medical record sold for $251, while credit card records were selling for 33 cents.
After the large data breaches at major retailers like Target and Home Depot, the black market for credit cards has been flooded. And after the bank becomes aware of the theft, those cards are usually canceled quickly.
In contrast, patient medical records typically include information not easily destroyed, including date of birth, Social Security numbers and even physical characteristics that make them more useful for things like identity theft, creation of visas or insurance fraud by falsely billing for expensive medical or dental procedures that were either never done or performed on someone else. Some criminals have also tried a form of so-called ransom ware in which they threaten to reveal medical information unless they are paid.
“The whole thing is evolving,” said Barbara Filkins, an analyst with the SANS Institute, which has studied the risk to the health care sector.
Hospital systems, for example, are increasingly asking for photo IDs and driver’s licenses in an effort to block patients who have stolen someone else’s medical identity, said John Barlament, a lawyer at Quarles & Brady in Milwaukee. The use of medical identity fraud is growing, he said. “It’s a one-way trend here,” he said.
The push to digitize patient health records in hospitals and doctors’ offices has also made medical records increasingly vulnerable, according to security experts. Moving medical records from paper to electronic form allows both patients and providers better access, but it has also made patient records susceptible to breaches, whether unintentionally or through a criminal attack.
About 90 percent of health care organizations reported they have had at least one data breach over the last two years, according to a survey of health care providers published last year by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy and data protection research firm. The founder, Larry Ponemon, a security expert, says most were because of employee negligence or system flaws, but a growing number are malicious or criminal.
Last year, 18 health care providers reported data breaches because of some form of hacking. Information at Centura Health was compromised last year after a phishing scheme obtained access to employee email accounts. The data included, in some instances, Social Security numbers, Medicare beneficiary numbers and clinical information for 12,000 patients of the facility, based in Englewood, Colo. In another case, a keystroke logger virus that infected three computers for a few weeks early last year at the student health center at the University of California, Irvine, may have captured patient’s health and dental insurance numbers and diagnoses.
Health care providers have sharply increased their spending on data security in the last year, but they remain technologically far behind other industries, say experts.
“When we go to a health care show and you look at the screens of different systems, it’s like we’re looking at Windows XP,” said Bob Janacek, a co-founder and chief technology officer of DataMotion, an email encryption and health information service provider. “But you go to a banking show and they’re talking about how to slice a billionth of a second off a transaction to get a competitive edge, it’s just totally different.”
In the new electronic records world, security experts say the risks of a data breach are found on many fronts. For instance, there are systems and protocols that allow for patient medical records to be encrypted and emailed from one provider to another, but some doctors are sending clinical records through personal email accounts using their own smartphones or tablets.
The Anthem breach has become the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny. Several state attorneys general are also conducting their own investigations or considering doing so, including George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of state insurance regulators, said it planned a multistate examination of the insurer. “We are in agreement that an immediate and comprehensive review of the company’s security must be a priority to ensure protection of consumers who are covered by Anthem,” said Monica Lindeen, the association president and the Montana insurance regulator, in a statement.

But cyberthieves can do some serious damage with medical information as well.
Anthem Health said this week that hackers obtained names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdays, email and employment information on up to 80 million current and former customers and Anthem employees. Although Anthem says the attackers did not get any medical records, they did get access to medical identification numbers found on insurance cards. Anthem offers several Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance plans across the country.
“You don’t need a complete medical record to commit medical identity theft if you have the correct name and Social Security number,” said Pam Dixon, executive director of World Privacy Forum. “The chief harm for medical identity theft is that your medical record will change without your knowledge.”
And in this case, the hackers have enough information to do exactly that. Here’s what you need to know:
THEFT TYPES In large-scale breaches like the one at Anthem, experts said the criminals could pose as medical billers and fraudulently charge consumers’ insurance companies for medical services and drugs. Not only is your insurer paying for something that you didn’t ask for, but the fraudsters can also alter your medical record, Ms. Dixon said.
With an insurance ID number in hand, it can be easier for criminals to attempt to acquire medical records or insurance codes to help guide them on what to bill for, she explained. “Searches through the data for cancer survivors or even those in current cancer treatment would allow for fake billing to be piggybacked onto the real billing. This makes it extremely difficult for the health plan to detect the fake billing, and the thieves then will get a stream of payouts over time. It adds up to a lot of money quickly.”
Anthem has said that it does not believe medical information like insurance claims or test results were compromised. Hospital and doctor information is also believed to have been spared.
WHAT TO DO Consumers should try to create their own copy of their medical file so they have an accurate version of their history should a fraudster make any changes, said Ms. Dixon, who has worked with many medical identity theft victims. Think about any significant or chronic medical conditions, surgeries or accidents — particularly for the last few years — and get a record from your doctors’ offices, hospital or other provider. Also get a record of your blood type and any drug allergies. If you have access to an online patient portal, try to print out or save a copy of those files elsewhere.
“You want to print a baseline record so that if it is altered without your knowledge by fraudulent activity,” Ms. Dixon said, “you have something that is really clean.” That will help prove your case, she said, and rebuild an accurate history.
WHAT TO MONITOR If you have online access to any of your medical records through a patient portal, keep a watchful eye for any suspicious activity. And closely monitor your explanation of benefit statements to be sure they do not include any services you did not receive (and if you suspect you are not receiving your statements, report that to your insurer as well). Credit-monitoring services may help pick up medical debt collections in your name that you do not owe, and calls from collectors may be another warning signal.
Also remember this is a long-term crime. Fraudulent activity may not show up for six months to a year, experts said, so a heightened sense of awareness and vigilance needs to become routine.
WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW Scam artists have already started sending emails that appear to be from Anthem’s insurers in an attempt to trick people into sharing personal data. The company said there was no indication that the scams were being conducted by the same thieves who conducted the cyberattack.
Anthem said it would contact current and former members via mail delivered by the United States Postal Service about the breach with specifics on how to enroll in free credit monitoring and ID protection services, which will be provided for a year. It cautioned not to click on any links in emails that appear to be from the company, and said not to open attachments, reply to senders or supply any information.
Anthem created a website, www.AnthemFacts.com, and a toll-free number, 1-877-263-7995, to respond to questions.

Holder Jr. used an email alias named for the Temptations, the Motown group. Lisa P. Jackson, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, used “Richard Windsor” — a combination of her dog’s name and a New Jersey town — for her electronic alter ego.
Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter keeps his personal and government emails separate on two different BlackBerrys. But two of his predecessors never used email for official business at all.
Members of President Obama’s cabinet have a wide variety of strategies, shortcuts and tricks for handling their email, and until three months ago there was no law setting out precisely what they had to do with it, and when. And while the majority of Obama administration officials use government email to conduct their business, there has never been any legal prohibition against using a personal account.
Hillary Rodham Clinton’s disclosure that she exclusively used a private email address while she was secretary of state and later deleted thousands of messages she deemed “personal” opens a big picture window into how vague federal email guidelines have been for the most senior government leaders.
Although the White House has strict requirements dating back two decades that every email must be saved, there is no such requirement for federal agencies. Instead they are in charge of setting their own policies for determining which emails constitute government records worthy of preservation and which ones may be discarded.
“It really is chaos across the government in terms of what agencies do, what individuals do, and people understand that they can decide what they save and what they don’t,” said Patrice McDermott, the director of the transparency watchdog group OpenTheGovernment.org. “If you leave it up to the agency, some are going to behave properly and take it seriously, and some are going to see it as carte blanche to whitewash the record.”
What is clear is that email poses a unique problem for government agencies, which are required under the law to preserve anything that relates to official business. “It doesn’t matter on what medium or in what form it occurs,” said Gary M. Stern, the general counsel for the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency in charge of preserving federal documents.
But, he said, “there’s such a challenge with email, because everyone gets a couple of hundred a day and nobody has the time to go through and say, ‘Is this a record, or is it not?’’’
While many agencies’ current practice is to print and file emails deemed worthy of saving, an Obama administration directive in 2012 mandates that agencies must devise a system for retaining and preserving email records electronically by the end of 2016.
Many agencies are playing catch-up to meet that deadline. Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Friday that the department started only last month to automatically archive senior officials’ emails.
Mr. Obama signed legislation late last year requiring government officials who use personal email addresses for official business to bring those records into the government within 20 days. Before that, the National Archives and Records Administration simply required those messages at some point to be provided to the government.
“The wiggle room for Mrs. Clinton is that those policies didn’t come into play until after she was gone” from the State Department in early 2013, said Thomas S. Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, an independent, nongovernmental organization focused on transparency.
The vague federal guidelines on email have caused agencies, cabinet members and other senior officials to forge their own policies and practices, sometimes getting them into trouble.
Ms. Jackson’s use of “Richard Windsor” — her dog’s name was Ricky, and her husband and sons lived in East Windsor, N.J., when she was Mr. Obama’s first E.P.A. administrator — led Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to charge that she had created the alias to “hide” her actions, part of what they described in a September 2013 report as a pattern of “obfuscation” and a “culture of secrecy and evasion.”
Ms. Jackson said the alias was a matter of convenience and practicality, arguing that she had complied with requirements that any message relating to E.P.A. business would be captured on the agency’s system.
“You’ll find this with any cabinet head,” Tom Reynolds, an E.P.A. spokesman, said of generic government email addresses. “You just can’t use those because you’d just get inundated with emails. It’s not pragmatic.”
Gary Gensler, the former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, often used his personal email for official business, including messages related to the collapse of the investment firm MF Global in 2011. The agency’s inspector general later called the practice improper, even though the inspector general said there was “nothing that appeared corrupt” in Mr. Gensler’s use of his personal account.
Robert M. Gates, who was defense secretary to Mr. Obama as well as President George W. Bush, never even had a government email account, a former aide said. When Mr. Gates sent email, it was from his personal account, usually reserved for sharing jokes or making dinner plans, the aide added.
“He thought it was just cleaner to keep these things separate and distinct, and ultimately not to do anything over email” related to his job, said the aide, who was not authorized to detail Mr. Gates’s email habits.
Since 2012, the Defense Department has forbidden the routine use of personal email to conduct official business, according to Lt. Col. Thomas C. Crosson, a spokesman for the department.
But such policies still leave room for interpretation. The personal email addresses of top government officials are coveted information for journalists, lobbyists, activists and others, who often use them to communicate outside official channels to assure administration sources of confidentiality. In those cases, it is up to the official to decide whether to treat the email communications as records that must be retained for the government.
The Department of Health and Human Services, where Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell uses her government address for all official business, adopted a new email policy in December. The agency now automatically archives and saves the emails of all senior officials and political appointees, said Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the department.
The White House adopted its strict email rules during the Clinton administration after a federal court determined that White House emails — until then considered the same as disposable sheets on a phone-message pad — should be treated as government records.
As part of a settlement in that case, a little-known staff secretary to President Bill Clinton drafted a memo laying out the new policy: Email had to be preserved and external networks should not be used because those messages would not be retained.
The aide’s name was John D. Podesta. “Podesta helped push the White House essentially into the digital age and created electronic archiving,” said Mr. Blanton, of the National Security Archive.
In January, Mr. Podesta left his post as a senior counselor to Mr. Obama. His anticipated new job: chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s expected presidential campaign.

It promoted state-of-the-art operating rooms, dazzling radiology equipment and a lovely suburban location. But only one line was printed in bold: “No E.M.R.”
In today’s digital era, a modern hospital deemed the absence of an electronic medical record system to be a premier selling point.
That hospital is not alone. A 2013 RAND survey of physicians found mixed reactions to electronic health record systems, including widespread dissatisfaction. Many respondents cited poor usability, time-consuming data entry, needless alerts and poor work flows.
If the only negative effect of health care computerization were grumpy doctors, we could muddle through. But there’s more. A friend of mine, a physician in his late 60s, recently described a visit to his primary care doctor. “I had seen him a few years ago and I liked him,” he told me. “But this time was different.” A computer had entered the exam room. “He asks me a question, and as soon as I begin to answer, his head is down in his laptop. Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap. He looks up at me to ask another question. As soon as I speak, again it’s tap-tap-tap-tap.”
“What did you do?” I asked.
“I found another doctor.”
Even in preventing medical mistakes — a central rationale for computerization — technology has let us down. A recent study of more than one million medication errors reported to a national database between 2003 and 2010 found that 6 percent were related to the computerized prescribing system.
At my own hospital, in 2013 we gave a teenager a 39-fold overdose of a common antibiotic. The initial glitch was innocent enough: A doctor failed to recognize that a screen was set on “milligrams per kilogram” rather than just “milligrams.” But the jaw-dropping part of the error involved alerts that were ignored by both physician and pharmacist. The error caused a grand mal seizure that sent the boy to the I.C.U. and nearly killed him.
How could they do such a thing? It’s because providers receive tens of thousands of such alerts each month, a vast majority of them false alarms. In one month, the electronic monitors in our five intensive care units, which track things like heart rate and oxygen level, produced more than 2.5 million alerts. It’s little wonder that health care providers have grown numb to them.
The unanticipated consequences of health information technology are of particular interest today. In the past five years about $30 billion of federal incentive payments have succeeded in rapidly raising the adoption rate of electronic health records. This computerization of health care has been like a car whose spinning tires have finally gained purchase. We were so accustomed to staying still that we were utterly unprepared for that first lurch forward.
Whopping errors and maddening changes in work flow have even led some physicians to argue that we should exhume our three-ring binders and return to a world of pen and paper.
This argument is utterly unpersuasive. Health care, our most information-intensive industry, is plagued by demonstrably spotty quality, millions of errors and backbreaking costs. We will never make fundamental improvements in our system without the thoughtful use of technology. Even today, despite the problems, the evidence shows that care is better and safer with computers than without them.
Moreover, the digitization of health care promises, eventually, to be transformative. Patients who today sit in hospital beds will one day receive telemedicine-enabled care in their homes and workplaces. Big-data techniques will guide the treatment of individual patients, as well as the best ways to organize our systems of care. (Of course, we need to keep such data out of the hands of hackers, a problem that we have clearly not yet licked.) New apps will make it easier for patients to choose the best hospitals and doctors for specific problems — and even help them decide whether they need to see a doctor at all.
Some improvements will come with refinement of the software. Today’s health care technology has that Version 1.0 feel, and it is sure to get better.
But it’s more than the code that needs to improve. In the 1990s, Erik Brynjolfsson, a management professor at M.I.T., described “the productivity paradox” of information technology, the lag between the adoption of technology and the realization of productivity gains. Unleashing the power of computerization depends on two keys, like a safe-deposit box: the technology itself, but also changes in the work force and culture.
In health care, changes in the way we organize our work will most likely be the key to improvement. This means training students and physicians to focus on the patient despite the demands of the computers. It means creating new ways to build teamwork once doctors and nurses are no longer yoked to the nurse’s station by a single paper record. It means federal policies that promote the seamless sharing of data between different systems in different settings.
We also need far better collaboration between academic researchers and software developers to weed out bugs and reimagine how our work can be accomplished in a digital environment.
I interviewed Boeing’s top cockpit designers, who wouldn’t dream of green-lighting a new plane until they had spent thousands of hours watching pilots in simulators and on test flights. This principle of user-centered design is part of aviation’s DNA, yet has been woefully lacking in health care software design.
Our iPhones and their digital brethren have made computerization look easy, which makes our experience with health care technology doubly disappointing. An important step is admitting that there is a problem, toning down the hype, and welcoming thoughtful criticism, rather than branding critics as Luddites.
In my research, I found humility in a surprising place: the headquarters of I.B.M.’s Watson team, the people who built the computer that trounced the “Jeopardy!” champions. I asked the lead engineer of Watson’s health team, Eric Brown, what the equivalent of the “Jeopardy!” victory would be in medicine. I expected him to describe some kind of holographic physician, like the doctor on “Star Trek Voyager,” with Watson serving as the cognitive engine. His answer, however, reflected his deep respect for the unique challenges of health care. “It’ll be when we have a technology that physicians suddenly can’t live without,” he said.
And that was it. Just an essential tool. Nothing more, and nothing less.

That was the question some teacher and parents groups have posed in their public responses to the news last week that Pearson, the education publisher, had been covertly monitoring social media sites to identify students who might have disclosed questions from its assessment tests.
In an effort to ease parent and teacher concerns, two congressmen are planning to introduce a bill on Monday that would place limits on how education technology companies can use information about kindergarten through 12th-grade students.
Called the Student Digital Privacy and Parental Rights Act, the bill would prohibit companies that operate school services — like online homework portals, digital grade books for teachers or student email programs — from knowingly using or disclosing students’ personal information to tailor advertisements to them. It would also bar them from collecting or using student data to create marketing profiles.
In phone interviews, Representative Jared S. Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican, the bill’s sponsors, said they hoped to increase trust in education technology companies.
“This is a first step in providing a framework that can address the concerns of parents and educators and, at the same time, allow the promise of education technology to transform our schools,” Mr. Polis said.
But the bill is likely to be opposed by education privacy advocates who seek stronger consent mechanisms for students and parents — as well as by industry groups that favor self-regulation.
“All this bill does is add additional legal hurdles for innovating educational services,” an executive at a technology trade group wrote to associates on Friday in a private email that was forwarded to a reporter with the stipulation that the writer of the email not be named.
As school districts across the country turn to powerful new digital education tools, efforts to increase teacher and parent buy-in have been multiplying. Industry executives say that so-called adaptive learning products seem particularly promising. These are apps and sites that can collect and analyze a wealth of student information with the idea of tailoring lessons on the spot to the abilities of each child.
“The world of big data has hit the classroom,” Mr. Messer said. “We want to preserve the positive benefits the technology can bring to student outcomes.”
Some parents have started warning, however, that school districts lack the resources to monitor how technology vendors use and secure their children’s records. These parents say they’re troubled by the risk of everything from data breaches and identity theft to the possibility of companies sharing sensitive details like students’ grades, disciplinary actions or health data with college or job recruiters.
Although there is a federal education privacy law that requires schools to maintain control over students’ educational records, critics say it has not kept pace with the practices of educational technology companies.
“As a parent, I’m concerned that there are vast amounts of academic, physical and behavioral information being acquired on children that could have negative implications for our children’s future,” said Anna Shah-Bomba, a mother of an elementary school student and a college student in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
Last year, for instance, ConnectEDU — a career planning site with listings on the academic, personal and career details of millions of students — sought to sell its databases as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.
After federal regulators intervened, the acquiring companies notified the site’s account holders that they could choose to have their information deleted.
Partly in response to such incidents, President Obama in January announced a proposal for a new student digital privacy law.
“We’re saying that data collected on students in the classroom should only be used for educational purposes,” Mr. Obama said in a speech at the time.
The Messer-Polis bill incorporates that principle. In addition to prohibiting school services from personalizing ads to students, the bill obliges vendors to delete students’ records should a school request it. It also requires vendors to allow schools or parents to see and correct student files.
But some privacy experts said the draft bill had major loopholes that would allow school services to use student information in ways students and parents might not expect or find acceptable.
For example, it allows school services to make unilateral changes to their contracts and privacy policies. It permits them to disclose student information for purposes like preparing for “employment opportunities.” And it would not prohibit sites like ConnectEDU from selling student records as part of a merger or acquisition.
The bill is also unlikely to prohibit companies like Pearson from monitoring the social media posts of students if those activities are performed on behalf of state educational agencies.
“Although this bill has some promising features,” said Khaliah Barnes, director of the student privacy project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research center in Washington, “it ultimately fails to uphold President Obama’s promise that the data collected in an educational context can be used only for educational purposes.”

She was 64 years old, had poorly controlled diabetes, a wound on her foot and a cast on her broken wrist. She didn’t drive, so getting to the people who could tend to her ailments was complicated and expensive. She had stopped taking her diabetes pills months before and was reluctant to use insulin; she was afraid of needles and was worried that a friend’s son, a drug addict, might use her syringes to inject them.
She was, however, able to make a phone call. And one day in October, in the offices of Iora Primary Care in Seattle, Dr. Carroll Haymon and Lisa Barrow, a “health coach,” huddled around a speakerphone, talking to her. Ms. Schock had recently become a patient of the practice, and the three discussed her problems — personal, financial, logistical — for nearly 45 minutes. At one point, Dr. Haymon asked why Ms. Schock had stopped taking her diabetes medication. The pills, Ms. Schock said, were too big, and they stuck in her throat.
“We can talk to the pharmacist,” Dr. Haymon said, gesturing for Ms. Barrow to add that to her list of follow-up actions. Ms. Barrow did and was able to find a version of the drug in a smaller size.
That kind of small change can make a big difference in a patient’s health — what good is the perfect drug if the patient can’t swallow it? — but the extra-mile work it took to get there can be a challenge for the typical primary care practice in the United States. Harried by busy schedules and paid on a piecework model, many doctors rush from visit to visit, avoid phone calls and emails that don’t generate payments, and often fail to address the complex social issues that hamper people’s health.
This misalignment of financial incentives is a huge problem for patients, who often can’t get the care they need. But it’s also a big economic problem. The United States has the costliest health care system in the world, even as many patients suffer from preventable illnesses and die younger than their peers in other countries. The system is so full of inefficiencies that Americans are often sicker even as everyone — patients, insurers, the government — ends up spending more money on care.
Iora thinks it may be able to solve both problems and make money doing so. Its business model is meant to keep patients like Ms. Schock out of the hospital by improving service while earning a dividend on the expensive care it was able to avoid.
The practice where Dr. Haymon works, in the Central District of Seattle, is one of five that Iora Health opened in just a few months last year. The company now has 140 employees in 11 practices, and it plans to open at least 10 more in 2015. It just raised $28 million in its third round of venture capital financing to help it expand. The ultimate goal is hundreds of practices across the country, a kind of Starbucks for health care. (The company recruited one executive whose last job was opening Au Bon Pain franchises.)
Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, who is one of the company’s founders and serves as its chief executive, said: “Building one good practice is mildly interesting, because a few people have done that. But how do you scale that across the country? That’s much harder.”
There is plenty of innovation in health care delivery, and Dr. Fernandopulle is far from the only physician who thinks he has a better idea about how to keep patients healthier for less money.
But his idea is intriguing because it offers the possibility of mass replication of quality care, which might affect the way medicine is practiced beyond his company. Few health care innovators now expand beyond their original location. A team of Stanford researchers recently looked around the country to find what they considered to be the very best primary care practices: All 11 had either one location or just a handful of sites.
“Most doctors have no business skills, and they don’t understand what venture investors and private investors do,” said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a professor of medicine and an author of the study, who directs the Stanford Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Dr. Fernandopulle’s goal is to “transform health care.” And his strategy is to take something small and effective and reproduce it in office after office. But as Professor Milstein points out, running one unconventional practice and keeping it great is very different from running 100.
Patients as Customers
The Iora practice where Dr. Haymon works is housed in an old beauty school east of downtown, in a commercial plaza shared by a Red Apple grocery store, a Walgreens pharmacy, a busy Starbucks and a Taco Del Mar. When the practice opened, in October, construction was finished on only half the space. Doctors saw patients on one side of a wall, while a construction crew finished work on the other.
One morning, the Iora team gathered in a back conference room for an 8 o’clock meeting called the huddle. The meeting is an essential piece of the Iora formula. The huddle leader rotates among the staff — a gesture to emphasize that the doctors don’t run the place. (This democratic impulse sometimes goes to extremes; there is no receptionist, and all the staff members, doctors included, trade off answering the phone.) This meeting was run by Michelle Howe, a registered nurse, and everyone had a silver Apple laptop for looking at patient data.
Iora practices do not accept any patients off the street. Instead, the company teams up with either an employer that pays for its workers’ health care or a private Medicare plan. Most of Iora’s early practices were with large companies looking to save on their health care bills. Others are partnerships with the health insurance company Humana. In most of the arrangements, the company receives a flat monthly payment for each patient and, if it saves the company money on overall health spending, it takes a percentage of what is saved.
The new Seattle practice has a Medicare plan as its partner. The huddle gives the team time to talk about the patients who will be visiting that day and ones who aren’t coming in but whom the clinicians are worried about. A patient like Ms. Schock is a good example of one who would have a high Iora “worry score,” a metric that is half clinical formula and half instinct. Patients with the highest scores are talked about the most in an attempt to think about their problems before their health deteriorates.
The huddle is also an old-fashioned staff meeting. There was a report, for instance, on the customer satisfaction surveys that the practice gives each patient after every visit. Patients are asked to rate their experience from one to 10 and to answer two other questions about their experiences. Iora’s management and its partners often point to this “net promoter score” questionnaire, which is intended to measure how likely patients are to endorse or promote the company, as evidence of the company’s success.
Similar surveys are conducted in other industries. Apple scores a 72. The health insurance company Kaiser has the highest score in its industry, a 35. An Iora practice, on average, scores above 90. Use of the questionnaires is one of the company’s basic principles. Staff members review the previous day’s answers at every huddle.In Seattle, Dr. Marty Levine questioned whether it made sense to ask the patients, most of them over 65, to answer three questions every time they visited. Geriatric medicine involves a lot of questionnaires, Dr. Levine said, and the patients might get fatigued. “Have we thought about just doing one question?” he asked.
There was discussion, and voting. In the end, the team voted 6 to 5 to keep the questionnaires the same as those in the other Iora practices.
The moment brought out a tension in Iora’s expansion plan: Its mission is at once to develop a standard formula and to allow its professionals to experiment and adapt to local conditions. Certain elements — the company’s proprietary electronic medical records, the design of the consultation rooms, the daily huddle itself — are nonnegotiable.
But other details are up to the individual practice staff. Group classes, for example, differ by site. The Medicare-only practices feature aerobics classes. The New Hampshire practice holds a popular mindfulness meditation session. The carpenters’ union practice in Dorchester, Mass., has a class called “Hammer Time,” essentially yoga with tools.
Focus on Venture Funding
Iora was founded three years ago, but Dr. Fernandopulle began developing his model for medical care years before. His basic insight is aligned with a big concern in health reform circles: The system is in many ways designed around providing hospital treatment, the most expensive form of health care.
There can be big savings from providing primary care services that keep patients in poor health out of the emergency room and the hospital by, say, making sure a diabetic’s foot wound is treated before expensive amputation is necessary. One of Dr. Fernandopulle’s early practices, which treated high-risk casino workers in Atlantic City, was described in The New Yorker in 2011. The practice was able to reduce hospitalizations for its patients 40 percent and save the casino workers’ union 12 percent in total health care spending. To work, it required persuading the union to pay much higher, per patient monthly fees for primary care medicine instead of the usual system, paying doctors by the visit.
This monthly fee is now the center of Iora’s business model, and Dr. Fernandopulle says it has been liberating. Because doctors don’t need to bill for every service they provided, Iora was able to switch to an electronic system that was better suited to managing patient health. And doctors don’t have to worry about documenting specialized codes for every visit to be paid. They can encourage patients to come in as often as they need. Iora makes staff members available around the clock through email and phone, services few practices provide because such visits can’t be billed.
The model also emphasizes the health coaches. Ms. Barrow, the health coach in Seattle, was trained overseas as a nurse, but a typical Iora coach has no health care training at all. Many come from customer service backgrounds. Their job is to help patients with health needs that are not medical — diet changes, tracking down the right supportive socks, finding free senior transportation vans that can transport them to office visits or exercise classes.
Most primary care doctors in the United States take care of more than 2,000 patients. A typical Iora doctor cares for about 1,000. Health coaches manage only a few hundred, giving them much more time for each one.
At an Iora practice in Hanover, N.H., for Dartmouth College employees, Patricia Fisken, a 63-year-old patient, and Tyler Hanna, a health coach, joked like old friends. In a sense, they are: Ms. Fisken, a music librarian at the college, comes in every few weeks to see Mr. Hanna, and she comes to the office every week for a mindfulness class. Ms. Fisken is basically healthy, but she is trying to lose weight and finds their regular sessions encouraging.
Dartmouth, one of the company’s first partners, says patient satisfaction is high and the school, a leader in health system research, is interested in whether this new model can work better than the usual way of doing things. But Richard G. Mills, the university’s executive vice president, said it was still unclear, three years in, whether the practice was saving the university money. The university would probably pay less to a conventional medical practice for patients like Ms. Fisken, without any serious health problems.
Iora has little published research on the cost savings it has achieved for its partners. The company’s small size makes it hard to produce data with statistical significance. Asked about current evidence of the model’s success, the company provided numbers about one of its sites, where researchers have compared Iora patients with similar patients elsewhere: Total spending was down 12 percent, with hospitalizations down 37 percent, compared with the control group. That may have been a practice with healthy patients, like Dartmouth, or one of the higher-risk patient groups; an Iora spokeswoman said she could not say which practice it was because of a confidentiality agreement with the sponsor.
Many of the basic elements of the Iora primary care approach — longer hours, more support staff and additional per patient funding — have been tried in other settings, especially in so-called patient-centered medical homes. So far, the results for those types of practices have not been promising. Few have shown real reductions in spending or in the frequency of patients entering hospitals.
Nonetheless, the company’s partners seem willing to give Iora the benefit of the doubt. Humana, which is working with Iora in the Seattle practices and two in Phoenix, wants to expand the contract to new sites, said Rich Powers, Humana’s vice president for provider management.
The company’s model has interested venture capital investors as well. The health care industry is in a period of rapid change, and many investors are looking for opportunities. Iora’s executives say all the waste in the health care system means there is plenty of money to be made with a more rational approach. And Iora’s investors — who have so far put in $42.25 million — think it can capture enough of those savings to be a strong investment.
“At hundreds of practices, on a consolidated basis it becomes very profitable,” said Michael Greeley, a general partner at the health care venture capital firm Foundation Medical Partners, the lead investor in the most recent funding round.
That ability to raise venture capital helped persuade the company’s executives that a profit-making model made sense. Most of the big hospital systems that are experimenting with new models of care are nonprofit. But Iora struggled to attract financing from the big health care foundations and the federal government. There is $10 billion in the federal budget to support health care innovation, including a special program just for primary care. But an Iora application was rejected because its model did not include co-payments, a typical requirement for Medicare.
“We found it was easier to convince V.C.s to invest in this,” Dr. Fernandopulle said. “The government has become so risk-averse because of the political climate.”
Expanding the Nest
An Iora is a type of bird native to Sri Lanka, where Dr. Fernandopulle was born, and the company’s Cambridge, Mass., headquarters is called “the nest.” The office feels like a tech start-up, with (mostly healthy) snacks in the kitchen and workstations set up on rows of long, shared tables. Many of its occupants are tech workers. Nearly 20 nest employees are developing the company’s electronic health record system. They built the first version in six months from scratch, and they are constantly refining it to run more smoothly and address requests from doctors.
A custom-built electronic health record system is the sort of investment that would never make sense if Iora were staying small. When the first practice opened, Steve Schrodel, the operations manager, spent hours logging every tongue depressor and latex glove he ordered into a database. For one practice, that would be a waste of time. But now, when Iora opens a new site, ordering supplies takes minutes.
Mr. Schrodel has the sort of unconventional background that the company seeks. He came to Iora after working for five years as a vice president for development at the restaurant chain Au Bon Pain. He was responsible for opening new stores in hospitals and airports.
Mr. Schrodel said the economics of a new Iora practice were surprisingly similar. “You need a certain amount of scale to make the model profitable,” he said. Dr. Fernandopulle estimates that achieving that size will take two more years.
But the mechanics of running a medical practice are different from those of a chain restaurant.
“This is, unfortunately, not like building Starbucks,” Dr. Fernandopulle said.
Most health care workers, of course, enter the field because they want to help people. But several Iora doctors and nurses told me Iora’s current customer-is-always-right approach is unusual compared with the places they worked before. At the Dartmouth practice, workers fretted over a single patient questionnaire that noted there was no milk in the lobby’s tea station.
As the company rapidly expands, replicating that customer-focused culture is difficult. Physicians need to be great doctors, of course, but they also need to be the sort of people who are comfortable when an intern leads the practice meeting or when they are asked to answer the phones.
Jill Exner, a nurse in Seattle, said she had struggled to think of former colleagues who would be good fits at Iora. Years working in hospitals had left many of them jaded, she said. “My nurse friends are really caring people, but there’s another piece of it.”
Dr. Fernandopulle and Alexander Packard, the company’s chief operating officer, have interviewed nearly all of the company’s current employees, and they have visited each of the sites many times. Both are charismatic leaders who leave strong impressions on the people they meet. (Nearly all the employees I interviewed quoted back things one or the other had told them.) But as the company grows, they will necessarily be less available.
The company’s answer to that problem is a human resources operation that tries to systematically identify people with the right qualities to join the practice.
Instead of inviting résumé drops, the company holds big open-house events where candidates go through a series of short interviews with Iora employees — a process they compare to speed-dating. Potential employees have interviews with six staff members in different roles, and any of them can veto a candidate. That has happened, for example, when a doctor was rude to a waiter at lunch. “We’re looking for things that don’t necessarily appear in the résumé,” said Jennifer Natenshon, a senior manager for talent and culture.
Frances Frei, a professor at Harvard Business School, studies businesses that specialize in customer service, and finds the Iora model intriguing.
“These guys have designed their model as if physics apply,” she said. A mistake many businesses make when they become bigger is that they become more complex. Iora seems focused on primary care, she said, with a particular reliance on health coaches, who are high in service but low in expertise and thus inexpensive to hire.
If scale in customer service businesses is difficult, then national scale in primary care medicine is unprecedented in the United States. Dr. Fernandopulle is confident, but he also knows the next few years will be telling.
“You don’t learn about this reading about it or talking about it in conferences,” he said. “You learn this by doing it.”

A scan of his brain eight years ago revealed a slight abnormality — nothing to worry about, he was told, but worth monitoring. And monitor he did, reading and studying about brain structure, function and wayward cells, and obtaining a follow-up scan in 2010, which showed no trouble.
But he knew from his research that his abnormality was near the brain’s olfactory center. So when he started smelling whiffs of vinegar last summer, he suspected they might be “smell seizures.”
He pushed doctors to conduct an M.R.I., and three weeks later, surgeons in Boston removed a cancerous tumor the size of a tennis ball from his brain.
At every stage, Mr. Keating, a 26-year-old doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, has pushed and prodded to get his medical information, collecting an estimated 70 gigabytes of his own patient data by now. His case points to what medical experts say could be gained if patients had full and easier access to their medical information. Better-informed patients, they say, are more likely to take better care of themselves, comply with prescription drug regimens and even detect early-warning signals of illness, as Mr. Keating did.
“Today he is a big exception, but he is also a glimpse of what people will want: more and more information,” said Dr. David W. Bates, chief innovation officer at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Some of the most advanced medical centers are starting to make medical information more available to patients. Brigham and Women’s, where Mr. Keating had his surgery, is part of the Partners HealthCare Group, which now has 500,000 patients with web access to some of the information in their health records including conditions, medications and test results.
Other medical groups are beginning to allow patients online access to the notes taken by physicians about them, in an initiative called OpenNotes. In a yearlong evaluation project at medical groups in three states, more than two-thirds of the patients reported having a better understanding of their health and medical conditions, adopting healthier habits and taking their medications as prescribed more regularly.
The medical groups with OpenNotes programs include Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and the Veterans Affairs department. By now, nearly five million patients in America have been given online access to their notes.
As an articulate young scientist who had studied his condition, Mr. Keating had a big advantage over most patients in obtaining his data. He knew what information to request, spoke the language of medicine and did not need help. The information he collected includes the video of his 10-hour surgery, dozens of medical images, genetic sequencing data and 300 pages of clinical documents. Much of it is on his website, and he has made his medical data available for research.
Still, he said he encountered a medical culture resistant to sharing data, owing to tradition, business practices and legal concerns.
“The person with the least access to data in the system is the patient,” he said. “You can get it, but the burden is always on the patient. And it is scattered across many different silos of patient data.”
Since his diagnosis last summer, Mr. Keating has become a passionate advocate for giving patients all the medical data they ask for. He has given talks at M.I.T., where he studies mechanical engineering, he has met with doctors, hospital administrators and researchers, and he has been invited to the White House.
He knows that what he is pushing goes against convention.
To a hospital, a patient is a revenue-generating asset, said Ben Shneiderman, a professor at the University of Maryland who is a health technology expert. Hold onto the patient’s information, and you are more likely to keep the patient. Health software suppliers have traditionally sold closed, proprietary systems, which tend to lock in customers.
“The problem is that you have institutions whose business models do not favor sharing information, either with other hospitals or patients,” said Mr. Shneiderman.
Yet the economic incentives for data-sharing, some medical experts say, are beginning to fall into place. Increasingly, providers will be paid a set amount of money for a population of patients, an approach called accountable care, and a departure from fee-for-service reimbursement in which doctors and hospitals are paid for each test and treatment.
Accountable care reimbursement is a critical ingredient in the Obama administration’s health care overhaul.
“The accountable care world is based on wellness rather than episodic illness,” said Dr. John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess. “In the fee-for-service world, the incentives for data-sharing were not there. But with accountable care, providers cannot survive unless they share data,” to help improve care and eliminate unnecessary tests.
The medical groups, Dr. Halamka said, will insist that their technology suppliers open up their software for automated data handoffs, which are a fixture of Internet technology but not health care technology.
Dr. Halamka is part of an effort to accelerate the adoption of open technology standards in health care, the Argonaut Project, which began in December. It has representatives from a few large medical groups, but also from leading suppliers of electronic health records, including Epic, Cerner and McKesson.
The Argonaut project, said Claudia Williams, a senior adviser for health innovation and technology policy in the White House, is a “very hopeful sign” that “incentives are beginning to line up in a powerful way” to encourage more openness and sharing of data among providers and with patients.
Opening data to patients raises questions. Will worried patients inundate physicians with time-consuming questions? Will sharing patient data add to legal risks? One detail in the yearlong study of OpenNotes underlines doctors’ concerns; 105 primary physicians completed the study, but 143 declined to participate.
Still, the experience of the doctors in the evaluation seemed reassuring. Only 3 percent said they spent more time answering patient questions outside of visits. Yet knowing that patients could read the notes, one-fifth of the physicians said they changed the way they wrote about certain conditions, like substance abuse and obesity.
Evidence of the benefit to individuals from sharing information rests mainly on a few studies so far. For example, 55 percent of the members of the epilepsy community on PatientsLikeMe, a patient network, reported that sharing information and experiences with others helped them learn about seizures, and 27 percent said it helped them be more adherent to their medications.
Mr. Keating has no doubts. “Data can heal,” he said. “There is a huge healing power to patients understanding and seeing the effects of treatments and medications.”
Health information, by its very nature, is personal. So even when names and other identifiers are stripped off, sharing personal health data more freely with patients, health care providers and researchers raises thorny privacy issues.
Mr. Keating says he is a strong believer in privacy, but he personally believes that the benefits outweigh the risks — and whether to share data or not should be an individual’s choice and an individual responsibility.
Not everyone, surely, would be as comfortable as Mr. Keating is sharing all his medical information. But he says he believes that people will increasingly want access to their medical data and will share it, especially younger people reared on social networks and smartphones.
“This is what the next generation, which lives on data, is going to want,” Mr. Keating said.

Yet all too often these transfers are being blocked by developers of health information technology or greedy medical centers that refuse to send records to rival providers.
This will not be an easy problem to fix, but some possible approaches were detailed in a report to Congress last week from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services.
The full extent of the problem is difficult to assess, according to the report, mainly because of contractual restrictions imposed by software developers on their customers. Even so, the office deduced from various sources — including customer complaints and interviews — that some software developers and medical centers have deliberately blocked the sharing of information. It did not name the parties because it could not determine with any certainty whether some of the information was blocked for legitimate reasons, like concern for patient privacy.
The motivations for hoarding or restricting data appear to be mostly business-related; for instance, companies lock customers into costly proprietary technology and often charge exorbitant fees for sending or receiving information. Some hospitals, critics say, won’t share information with doctors outside their own networks, lest they lose control of the patient and erode their dominance of a local market. Larger hospital systems that share health information internally sometimes won’t do so with competing hospitals and unaffiliated providers.
The report suggests some ways to combat information blocking, including new transparency requirements (already in the pipeline) for developers to disclose the restrictions and costs associated with buying their systems. There are additional steps the federal government could take on its own. For example, it could name the suspected wrongdoers and let them explain the reasons behind their actions. Congress could go still further and pass a new law providing criminal penalties and stiff fines for vendors and providers who deliberately block information sharing with no valid excuse.
The federal government has invested some $28 billion to convert hospitals and health care professionals to electronic health records, with gratifying results. More than half of the nation’s doctors have adopted electronic health records. It would be a shame if limitations on their ability to send and receive digital records undercut national efforts to improve the quality of care.

Now a part of that information is hidden.,"Researchers who want to study Medicare or Medicaid patients with substance-use disorders — and illnesses disproportionately affecting them like H.I.V. and hepatitis C — are, at best, working with biased data. At worst, they’re flying blind.
That’s because agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, without public notice and because of patient privacy concerns, decided in 2013 to remove researchers’ access to certain types of Medicare and Medicaid data. Without these data — all relating, even tangentially, to patients with substance-use disorders — health researchers fear they will be hampered in their quest to improve care.
Consider patients seen by the Veterans Health Administration. Because patients use health care from other providers, too, a researcher might need to combine V.H.A. data with that from Medicare and Medicaid to assess and improve outcomes from treatment. Suppose treatment for alcohol addiction reduced the likelihood of an accident that would land a patient in the emergency room. Because many emergency room visits are outside the V.H.A. system, Medicare and Medicaid data are essential to measuring this effect of treatment. If researchers can’t see it, they can’t improve it. (Full disclosure: I am employed as a health economist with the V.H.A. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of the Department of Veterans Affairs.)
When health care researchers received Medicare and Medicaid data last year, some of them noticed — to their shock — that much of it was missing. (Because they weren’t told of this, many didn’t even notice until the news broke last December.)
All told, the suppression affects about 7 to 8 percent of inpatient hospital medical records or about 1 million Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. A smaller proportion of records pertaining to outpatient care and nursing home care is also withheld. The systematic removal of this much data can lay waste to a significant segment of research.
Pointing to decades-old regulations designed to protect patients’ privacy, Aaron Albright, Media Relations Group director for the agency overseeing Medicare and Medicaid, said that release of data pertaining to patients with substance-use disorders was not permitted “without patient consent.”
The caution is understandable. Substance-use disorders carry stigma. Some patient advocates have expressed concerns that medical data could be used by law enforcement to incarcerate patients or to separate children from their parents. Perhaps the information could be used to deny employment. Without robust privacy protections, these concerns could deter some patients from seeking treatment.
But as the University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley and I described in the New England Journal of Medicine, the problem for research is substantial. Because detailed, individual-level health care data from private insurers is often costly or difficult to obtain, for decades Medicare and Medicaid data have offered the best available window into health care use, outcomes and costs. And for all those years, those data were made available and in full.
Regulations that justify the withholding of these research data also stymie the delivery of health care. Doctors’ offices and hospitals are not allowed to share patient data pertaining to substance-use disorders or treatment without each patient’s consent to each transmission of information.
This may have been tenable when records were entirely on paper and were rarely shared across providers. But now that many have gone digital, with data sharing more commonplace and encouraged, it’s far more onerous. Many organizations, therefore, exclude such information from their electronic data systems, which can put patients at risk.
Imagine that a doctor sees a patient who does not disclose a history of opioid addiction, which was diagnosed at another doctor’s office. If that physician prescribes a narcotic painkiller, he could fuel the patient’s addiction, with potentially lethal results. But today, the prescribing physician couldn’t be told about the condition absent patient consent — even if the two physicians are working together to coordinate that very patient’s care.
Can we exchange and analyze patient data to improve care while minimizing the risk of and harm from breaches of privacy? It’s already standard for researchers to work in secure data environments. They’re already subject to criminal penalties if they don’t adhere to strict data protection protocols. You cannot obtain access to Medicare and Medicaid research data without submitting to those conditions.
Yes, as tight as the data protections already are, they could always be strengthened, though at some cost. (For example, access to certain types of Census Bureau data requires a background check, fingerprinting and an in-person interview.)
The current privacy protection pulls at some of the ambitions of health care reform.
The Affordable Care Act and other recent legislation promote the exchange of electronic medical data and analysis of such data to enhance the quality and efficiency of health care. In the midst of an opioid epidemic — as we are — and as we struggle to finance new and costly drugs for hepatitis C — which disproportionately affects drug users — the timing of the Medicaid and Medicare data suppression could hardly be worse.
The administration announced this month that it would be revisiting the relevant regulations. This gives the government an opportunity to balance privacy concerns with data access for research and coordination across providers.

But some tech companies, hospitals and laboratories are intentionally blocking the electronic exchange of health information because they fear that they will lose business if they share information on patients with competing providers, administration officials said. In addition, officials said, some sellers of health information technology try to “lock in” customers by making it difficult for them to switch to competing vendors.
“We have received many complaints of information blocking,” said Dr. Karen B. DeSalvo, the national coordinator for health information technology. “We are becoming increasingly concerned about these practices.”
The White House and Congress are looking for ways to ensure a freer flow of information.
Mr. Obama has made computerizing patients’ medical records a priority of his administration. Four weeks after taking office, he signed an economic stimulus bill that offered bonus payments to doctors and hospitals adopting the new technology. He said that it would save money by reducing waste and duplication, and that it could save lives by improving care.
Many doctors and hospitals have begun using electronic medical records, but providers with different systems are often unable to share data in electronic form.
“We have electronic records at our clinic, but the hospital, which I can see from my window, has a separate system from a different vendor,” said Dr. Reid B. Blackwelder of Kingsport, Tenn., chairman of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “The two don’t communicate. When I admit patients to the hospital, I have to print out my notes and send a copy to the hospital so they can be incorporated into the hospital’s electronic records.”
Dr. Peter E. Masucci, a pediatrician in Everett, Mass., said he had been trying for more than five years to connect his electronic medical records with those of a hospital where he often sends patients. “It’s never happened,” he said.
In a report to Congress, Dr. DeSalvo gave several other examples:
 A doctor may have to pay exorbitant fees to transfer information on patients from the medical record system of one vendor to that of another.
 A network of doctors and hospitals refuses to share electronic information on patients with providers outside the network, even when the information is needed to treat patients and sharing the data is allowed by federal rules.
 Doctors obtain laboratory services and health records technology from one company, which will not let them connect to a competing laboratory, even though the connection is technically feasible and the doctors are willing to pay for it.
The Obama administration said that some hospitals and technology companies appeared to be using electronic health records as part of a business strategy to “enhance their market dominance.” But Dr. DeSalvo said it was difficult to discover the details of such arrangements because some information technology companies “prohibit customers from reporting or even discussing” terms of their contracts.
Dr. DeSalvo’s office is working with the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Tara Isa Koslov, a lawyer at the commission, said her agency was “paying close attention to developments in health I.T. markets and the reports of information blocking.”
Peter J. DeVault, a vice president of the Epic Systems Corporation in Verona, Wis., one of the largest suppliers of software for electronic health records, said: “We do not participate in any activities that could be described as information blocking. To our knowledge, these activities are very rare, if they exist at all.”
But Dan Haley, vice president of a competing company, Athenahealth, based in Watertown, Mass., said: “This is a serious problem. Some health I.T. vendors have business models that create real impediments to the sharing of medical information.”
Under a typical arrangement, Mr. Haley said, a vendor tells hospitals, “It will cost you $1 million to build a connection to another system, we will charge $500,000 a year to maintain that connection, and on top of that we’ll charge $2 each time we send a patient’s records to hospitals that use a different system.”
Congress took a first step to address the problem in a bill signed into law last month. It said that doctors and hospitals must not deliberately block the sharing of information if they receive federal bonus payments for using electronic health records.
A separate bill approved last week by a House committee defines “information blocking” as a federal offense. Doctors, hospitals and technology vendors could be punished with civil fines of up to $10,000 for each violation.
“Since 2009, we have spent $29 billion to encourage the adoption of electronic health records, but the data is still fragmented,” said Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas. “Vendors continue to impede the exchange of information.”
Even within a hospital, communications can be a challenge.
William F. Barrow II, president of Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center in Lafayette, La., said his 186-bed hospital had two systems of electronic health records — one from the Cerner Corporation for inpatients, another from Epic for outpatients.
“It’s hard to get the two to work optimally together,” Mr. Barrow said.
Amalia R. Miller, an economist at the University of Virginia who has studied the industry, said: “Even when hospitals have the technological capability, they do not always share information with hospitals outside their system. If information is portable, patients can switch providers more easily, and that could hurt the business of some hospitals.”
Thus, Ms. Miller said, federal money meant to foster an interconnected web of health care providers may inadvertently have subsidized the creation of “information silos,” making it more difficult to share data and coordinate care for consumers.

Now the focus is on those who have served.,"Researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health have developed a database they say can identify veterans with a high likelihood of suicide, in much the same way consumer data is used to predict shopping habits.
In a study published Thursday in The American Journal of Public Health, researchers reported that a computer algorithm using hundreds of variables among millions of V.A. patients was able to correctly predict small subgroups with suicide rates up to 80 times higher than V.A. patients as a whole. The study also found that current practices that rely on doctors and other medical staff to flag high-risk patients miss the vast majority of such veterans.
“So much of suicide prevention is throwing things at a wall and hoping they will stick,” said Caitlin Thompson, the V.A.’s deputy director for suicide prevention and an author of the study. “We haven’t been able to target people, so having something like this is such a gift.”
The suicide rate for veterans has been much higher than that of the civilian population for years, and it has risen sharply among young veterans since 2009. The V.A. estimates the suicide rate for male veterans younger than 29 is 80 per 100,000 — about four times the comparable civilian rate. Data shows the rate for female veterans, though much lower than the male rate, is six times the comparable civilian figure. Increased mental health staff and traditional suicide prevention efforts have so far failed to bring the rates down.
Four years ago, the V.A. began building a database to try to pinpoint high-risk veterans using national electronic health records for the millions of individuals in the V.A. system. It was designed to search for patterns in existing records using 381 variables, including medications, diagnoses, age, sex and a history of suicide attempts.
To ensure that the patterns the system found could be used to predict actual suicide risk, researchers created the algorithm using data from half of the patient population from 2008 to 2011, then tested it on the other half from the same period, said a lead researcher, Robert Bossarte, the director of epidemiology in the V.A.’s Office of Public Health. Predictions for the test population lined up with the actual suicide rates, he said.
The health care field is increasingly using sophisticated algorithms to predict medical outcomes, and the Army already employs a similar database to monitor active-duty suicides, but this is the first time predictive risk has been used to look at veteran suicides on a large scale.
Dr. John Curry, a psychologist who is a professor in the Duke University School of Medicine psychiatry department, said the V.A. database would be useful, and that it appeared to pinpoint more people at risk of suicides “than identified by clinical variables alone.”
He said one challenge would be persuading patients to follow a suicide prevention plan based on how a database assesses their personal risk. “You’d have to work with the patient to accept it,” he said.
The database found that the 1 percent of patients with the highest risk were 12 to 14 times more likely to commit suicide than V.A. patients as a whole. The top 0.01 percent of patients were 80 times more likely.
The top 1 percent of patients tended to be young, single males with several medical problems including sleep disorders, pain and traumatic brain injuries. Most were taking antidepressants and sedatives. More than 90 percent had used V.A. mental health services in the year before their deaths.
Though the database can pinpoint high-risk patients, the V.A. still cannot predict suicide in individuals, Mr. Bossarte said. “The risk score is more like a cholesterol number,” he said. “Just because it’s high does not mean you are going to have a heart attack, but it does mean we should take measures to lower the risk.”
The V.A. is still developing how it will use the data, said Ms. Thompson, the suicide prevention official. “Are we going to call them and say, ‘Hey, guess what, you are at high risk of suicide?’ Of course we can’t do anything like that,” she said. “So we are developing steps our clinicians can take to use this information.”
Many of the risk factors, such as being hospitalized for a psychiatric condition or making a previous suicide attempt, may seem obvious, said Michael Schoenbaum of the National Institutes of Health, who was an author of the study. But researchers found that these high-risk patients, who should have been flagged by doctors and other health care staff under traditional suicide prevention protocols now in place, were not.
“Doctors are pretty bad at assessing risk,” Mr. Schoenbaum said. “The database is so overwhelmingly better than just guessing, which is what we’ve been doing.”

But the law still faces stiff political resistance in many quarters and could yet return as an explosive issue in the 2016 elections.
The impact of the law appears most clearly in the shrinking number of uninsured Americans. In 2014, the number of people without health insurance coverage fell to 36 million from 44.8 million in 2013, a decline of nearly 20 percent, according to data released this week by the National Center for Health Statistics.
That decline was made possible in part by federal insurance subsidies, which the court upheld on Thursday, and by the expansion of Medicaid in more than half of the states, which was financed under the law.
Health insurance companies have reinvented themselves, adopting new business models. The law requires them to accept anyone who applies for insurance and prohibits them from charging sick people more, as they did for decades. Insurers not only survived but are thriving, and the industry is being swept by interest in mergers as companies try to cut costs and premiums while preserving their profits.
The law has also, by many accounts, contributed to a significant slowdown in the growth of national health spending and the cost of Medicare, a pacesetter whose influence extends far beyond its 55 million beneficiaries. No one can say for sure whether the trend will continue, or how much of it is attributable to the health care law.
And industry executives said the law had fostered a revolution in the delivery of health care, encouraging hospitals large and small to increase the coordination of care and the use of electronic medical records while minimizing the readmission of patients who have been discharged. Doctors and hospitals have accepted that they will be rewarded or penalized for the quality of care they provide: their ability to keep people healthy. Medicare and private insurers have adopted a dizzying array of “quality metrics.”
“This is now the law of the land,” said Dr. H. Jack Geiger, who founded the country’s first community health centers in the 1960s. “It is a victory for all poor people without access to health care.”
In the Rose Garden on Thursday, President Obama rejoiced, declaring, “The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.” Conservatives lamented the decision for the same reason.
But many questions about the law’s impact were not resolved by the ruling. Foremost among them is whether the law is making health care truly affordable for most consumers.
Many people complain that they must pay several thousand dollars in deductibles before they receive tangible benefits from insurance policies. Many others assert that the law has encouraged insurers to narrow their networks of health care providers, limiting the selection of doctors and hospitals available to some consumers.
And rate increases could be coming for consumers in 2016. Many insurers have sought increases of 15 percent to 25 percent. The cost of claims has substantially exceeded what they expected when they set premiums, they said.
Consumers can try to avoid big rate increases by switching to less expensive health plans. “You can move to another carrier even if you have a pre-existing condition,” said Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner of Washington State.
The largest question — whether the law has improved health care outcomes for Americans — remains unanswered, because researchers have not had enough time to reach a conclusion.
Obama administration officials say the law benefits consumers by increasing competition among insurers. Many insurers have discovered a potentially profitable line of business in the public marketplaces where more than 10 million people have obtained coverage, subsidized in most cases by the federal government.
But the law has also unleashed a “merger frenzy,” said Prof. Leemore S. Dafny, a health economist at Northwestern University who used to work at the Federal Trade Commission. Hospitals are buying up other hospitals and physician groups. Commercial insurers like UnitedHealth Group, Cigna, Aetna, Humana and Anthem are chasing one another in a wave of possible mergers and acquisitions.
Such consolidation has the potential to improve care, but it could also increase the ability of individual health care providers and insurers to demand higher prices. And it could leave consumers with fewer options.
The court’s decision on Thursday, in King v. Burwell, was a huge victory for Democrats, who adopted the law on party-line votes in 2010. But it may also prove to be a blessing for Republicans, who can continue to pummel “Obamacare” without having to enact a replacement for it.
Some Republicans acknowledged that voters would probably have blamed them if the court had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, cutting off insurance subsidies for millions of people in the 34 states that use the federal marketplace.
Four Republican governors running or expected to run for president — Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and John R. Kasich of Ohio — were among those who refused to set up state exchanges under the health care law.
The ruling leaves many Republican candidates in a more familiar and comfortable position: They can call generally for the abolition or replacement of the health care program without having to enact or specify an alternative.
Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a spokesman for Republicans on health policy, said the fate of the law would be decided in the 2016 presidential election. Jeb Bush, a leading candidate for the party’s 2016 nomination, pledged on Thursday to “work with Congress to repeal and replace this flawed law with conservative reforms that empower consumers with more choices and control over their health care decisions.”
Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said Republicans would keep trying to repeal and replace the law. “Obamacare is fundamentally broken, increasing health care costs for millions of Americans,” Mr. Boehner said. “Today’s ruling doesn’t change that fact.”
Individual pieces of the health care law are popular, particularly a provision that allows young people to remain on their parents’ health plans until they turn 26. But the latest poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the public remains deeply divided over all, with 42 percent reporting an unfavorable view of the law and 39 percent reporting a favorable view. By contrast, in April 2010, the split was 40 percent unfavorable and 46 percent favorable.
The subsidies at the heart of King v. Burwell have, by many measures, succeeded in expanding coverage.
More than seven million people are enrolled in the federal health insurance marketplace, and 87 percent of them receive subsidies in the form of tax credits to help pay their premiums, the government says. Without subsidies, many would be unable to buy insurance.
The subsidies also appear to have drawn substantial numbers of younger, healthier Americans into the new insurance markets, stabilizing premiums even for people who pay the full cost themselves.
The subsidies average $272 a month, or $3,264 a year, and cover nearly three-fourths of the average premium for people receiving assistance, the government says. Beneficiaries are clustered in the lower income brackets.
Two-thirds of federal marketplace customers have incomes less than twice the poverty level (below about $23,500 a year for a single person), according to the Department of Health and Human Services. More than 40 percent have incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level.
Lower-income people have long been more likely to be uninsured.
Lizzie Perez Jimenez, 22, of Tampa, Fla., is studying to become a nurse and works part-time at a store in a shopping mall. She earns $1,300 a month and is not offered insurance. Her premium is $200 a month. She pays $50 and receives a tax credit of $150.
Without the credit, “I probably would not have insurance,” said Ms. Jimenez, who has asthma. “It’s way too expensive for me.”
A survey last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that nearly six in 10 people with coverage through the exchanges were previously uninsured.
Medicaid has been at least as significant as the exchanges in reducing the number of uninsured Americans. More than 71 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid and its sister program, the Children’s Health Insurance Program — an increase of 12.3 million, or 21 percent, since October 2013, when the marketplaces opened.
The health care law greatly expanded Medicaid eligibility. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was an option for states, not a requirement. To date, 29 states have taken the option, and Republican opposition remains strong in many others.
The 2012 ruling has created a certain unevenness in health coverage. Nearly four million poor people remain uninsured because they live in states that chose not to expand Medicaid. They have too much income to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies in the insurance exchanges. They would have been eligible for Medicaid if their states had expanded the program, experts say. Most of these people live in the South, and many are black.
Of the 21 states that have not expanded Medicaid, all but three are led by Republican governors. Some of those governors, including Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Matt Mead of Wyoming, have tried to expand coverage, but their Republican-controlled state legislatures have refused.
Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays all costs for newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries through 2016, and after that, the federal share never goes below 90 percent.
Mr. Obama said he hoped to persuade more states to expand Medicaid. “We’ve still got states out there that, for political reasons, are not covering millions of people that they could be covering,” he said Thursday, “despite the fact that the federal government is picking up the tab.”
Charles R. Drapeau, 63, of East Waterboro, Me., who bought insurance through the federal exchange, said he was “ecstatic and extremely relieved” at the ruling.
Mr. Drapeau has multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, and takes a drug that costs more than $10,000 a month. A federal subsidy covers nearly half of the $1,600 monthly premium for a policy covering him and his wife.
Now, he said, he worries that his coverage will be reduced as a result of the 2016 elections.

So he dropped into a MinuteClinic above a CVS store in Midtown Manhattan on a lunch break. Within minutes, a nurse practitioner tested him for strep throat (negative), suggested lozenges and a regimen (ample fluids, no spicy food), collected a co-payment ($25 cash) and sent him on his way.
“That was quick,” said Mr. Gaffney, 26, an account executive for Indeed.com, who, like millions of Americans, does not have a primary care physician, even though he is covered by health insurance. He has been meaning to find a doctor since moving to New York last year, but his sore throat did not seem serious enough to warrant what was sure to be a time-consuming search and a long wait for an appointment.
The CVS MinuteClinic, on the other hand, was just blocks away from his office. “I waited longer for my bagel this morning,” he said.
With 7,800 retail stores and a presence in almost every state, CVS Health has enormous reach. And while shoppers might think of CVS as a place to pick up toothpaste, Band-Aids or lipstick, it is also the country’s biggest operator of health clinics, the largest dispenser of prescription drugs and the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager. With close to $140 billion in revenue last year — about 97 percent of that from prescription drugs or pharmacy services — CVS is arguably the country’s biggest health care company, bigger than the drug makers and wholesalers, and bigger than the insurers.
Even before the Affordable Care Act created millions of newly insured customers in the almost $3 trillion health care industry, CVS saw that there were more profits to be made handling prescription drugs than selling diapers. But while its transformation from drugstore to health care company began a decade ago, CVS has more recently taken on a new advocacy role, that of a public enemy of cigarettes.
Last year, CVS became the first major pharmacy chain to stop selling tobacco, a business that brought in $2 billion a year. And on Tuesday, CVS said that it would resign from the United States Chamber of Commerce after revelations that the chamber and its foreign affiliates were engaged in a global lobbying campaign against antismoking laws.
Its stand against smoking has allowed CVS to make alliances with health care providers and rebrand itself fully as a health care company. But with smoking rates on a steady decline, and cigarettes sales slumping, CVS also saw that future profits lie not with Big Tobacco but in health and wellness.
Taking the high road for health has its challenges. For one thing, it means new competitors in a rapidly changing industry. And, for a major retailer with tens of thousands of products on its shelves, it leads to an uncomfortable question: If we cannot sell cigarettes, what does that mean for potato chips?
Road to Growth
The Consumer Value Store started as a scrappy discount health and beauty outlet in Lowell, Mass., in 1963. Four years later, the small chain opened its first in-store pharmacies, and those became the core of the company — and its growth — for years. Larry Merlo, the chief executive, is a pharmacist by training and came into the company when it bought People’s Drug, a drugstore chain based in a suburb of Washington.
In a phone interview, Mr. Merlo spoke mostly in corporate platitudes, but when the conversation turned to the subject of pharmacists, he spoke passionately about pharmacists’ role in delivering health care.
“Hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis,” he said. “It’s the same story — people don’t take their medication as prescribed.”
Pharmacists, who see patients more frequently than doctors do, can make sure patients stay on their drug regimens, he said, keeping them out of the hospital and saving the health care system billions of dollars down the road.
“I think back to my own personal experience,” he said. “Sometimes, it’s as simple as answering questions to get people to stay on their prescription therapies.”
Mr. Merlo said the company stood out in the breadth of products and services it offered: Its MinuteClinics diagnose and treat patients, and its pharmacies dispense medicine to more than two million prescriptions a day. It negotiates the price of medicines and helps 65 million people navigate drug coverage under their insurance plans.
The shift toward health care started in 2004, when CVS acquired Eckerd Stores and Eckerd Health Services, giving CVS a foothold in administering drug benefits to employees of big corporations and government agencies. Two years later, CVS acquired MinuteClinic, a pioneering in-store health clinic chain that was offering treatment for routine illnesses, basic screenings and vaccinations. CVS also expanded its very profitable specialty pharmacy business, which focuses on expensive drugs to treat complex or rare diseases like cancer or H.I.V.
Then in 2007 came the $21 billion merger between CVS and Caremark, which gave birth to the country’s leading pharmacy benefits manager. Three years ago, CVS struck a deal with the medical products distributor Cardinal Health to form the country’s largest generic drug sourcing operation. It followed up with a $2.1 billion acquisition of Coram, a business that allows CVS to dispatch technicians to patients’ homes to administer pharmaceuticals through needles and catheters.
The acquisitions keep coming. In May, it paid $12.7 billion to acquire Omnicare, which distributes prescription drugs to nursing homes and assisted-living operations. Just weeks later, CVS announced it would buy Target’s pharmacy and clinic businesses for $1.9 billion and left open the possibility of pursuing further deals. Once the Target deal closes, CVS will operate about 9,600 retail stores, or about one out of seven retail pharmacies, according to Pembroke Consulting. Last year, the company changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health.
The growth of CVS comes at a time when the way Americans get access to and pay for health care is evolving quickly. Surveys show that many of the estimated 30 million people who gained insurance coverage last year under health care reform do not have a primary health care physician or do not use one. Many, too, opted for high-deductible health plans and are expected to become picky with the dollars they spend, and less tolerant of the opaque pricing that is still the industry’s norm. And consumers in general are starting to demand more convenient, on-demand access to health care, closer to home.
In that fast-changing world, CVS’s strategy is to be a one-stop shop for health care.
“Say you have diabetes, and you go into a pharmacy to get your insulin, how great is it if, in the same aisle, there’s a cookbook for people with diabetes?” said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC’s Health Research Institute. “And maybe there’s some foods that are already approved for you, and a place to check your feet, and a clinician to check your eyes,” she said.
“Consumers are saying: I want all of that at a place near my house that’s open on Saturdays, when it’s convenient for me. I want that place to post prices. It’s in CVS’s interest to pull in more and more pieces of that puzzle.”
A typical CVS clinic staffed by nurse practitioners sees 35 to 40 patients a day; those patients pay $79 to $99 for minor illnesses and injuries, and most insurance plans are accepted. Analysts estimate each clinic typically brings in $500,000 a year, representing just a fraction of CVS’s revenue. Still, the clinics are an important part of the company’s health care proposition.
Other retailers are also getting into the business. The number of retail clinic sites grew to 1,800 locations nationwide in 2014 from 200 in 2006, though they still represent just 2 percent of primary care encounters in the United States, according to a report published this year by Manatt Health, a health advisory practice, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. But CVS is by far the leader. Walmart, which charges just $40 a visit, has fewer than 100 clinics, compared with the more than 900 in CVS’s portfolio. Walgreens, the second-largest, has half as many clinics as CVS. And CVS plans to add more, reaching 1,500 by 2017, the company has said.
Whether these clinics provide the best kind of care is a question sometimes raised by doctors in more traditional practices, like Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a doctor in Milford, Neb.
“These retail clinics, they’re run by competent folks, and they probably have some role to play,” he said. “But you’re being seen at a clinic next to the frozen food section by a stranger. And if you go back for a follow-up, you’re going to get seen by someone else.”
For employers and insurers, however, the clinics offer a way to reduce costs for noncritical conditions. A study by researchers at the RAND Corporation estimated that more than a quarter of emergency room visits could be handled at retail clinics and urgent care centers, creating savings of $4.4 billion a year.
Reducing health care spending, however, may turn out to be complicated.
“You might imagine that they keep people out of E.R., so that’s one way you could save money,” said Martin Gaynor, professor of economics and public policy at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. “On the other hand, just because they’re more convenient, people might go and obtain care in circumstances where they otherwise would not have sought care.”
CVS might have more sway reducing health care costs in its role as a middleman between drug companies and patients with drug benefits. The company is expected to start shifting the balance between end users on one hand, and drug manufacturers and wholesalers on the other.
CVS and other large dispensing pharmacies — Walgreens, Express Scripts, Rite Aid and Walmart — made up about 64 percent of prescription-dispensing revenue in the United States in 2014, according to Pembroke Consulting. That year, CVS was also the leading provider of specialty drugs in North America, with $20.5 billion in revenue, representing 26 percent of the total market.
“Scale is a big factor in pharmacy,” said Joseph Agnese, senior equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “There’s a lot of pricing pressure from drug manufacturers and one way for retailers can come back at them is to become larger, and become a more significant purchaser of drugs.”
Dr. Gaynor of Carnegie Mellon said, however, that cost reduction varied greatly by type of drug. “If there’s a drug that is very important for CVS to carry, and there are no alternatives, they aren’t going to have a lot of negotiating power,” Dr. Gaynor said. “But of course, the bigger CVS gets, the more they can move product, the more important it becomes.”
The company’s size also creates significant competition issues, says David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer and former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission who often represents independent pharmacies. CVS’s ownership of Caremark could restrict consumers’ access to rival pharmacies, he said, and CVS’s acquisition of Omnicare, already a dominant player in long-term care, could reduce competition in that industry.
“There are tremendous concerns when you see someone becoming so terrifically large,” Mr. Balto said. “The acquisitions might conceivably be efficient, but whether those efficiencies are passed on to consumers really depends on the level of competition in the market.”
Quitting Cigarettes
Helena B. Foulkes, who leads CVS’s retail business, swept past the sales counter at a newly renovated CVS in downtown Manhattan. Where cigarette packs once lined up in neat rows, now there were nicotine gum and patches to help smokers quit. (There are no e-cigarettes either, much to the chagrin of that industry, which had hoped CVS would embrace its products as a lower-risk alternative.)
Ms. Foulkes, who lost her mother to lung disease, leads the retail business, which is starting to change to fit the company’s health care bent better.
The move to forgo $2 billion in annual tobacco sales has bolstered CVS’s health care bona fides. The White House lauded CVS’s move. “Thanks @CVS_Extra, now we can all breathe a little easier,” Michelle Obama wrote in a Twitter post. The praise seemed to give Mr. Merlo a jolt of confidence. At a TEDx talk this year in Winston-Salem, N.C., he declared: “CVS kicks butts across the U.S.”
“When we exited the tobacco category, it was the most important decision we’d made as a company,” Ms. Foulkes said. “That decision really became a symbol both internally and externally for the fact that we’re a health care company.”
It also made economic sense. Adult smoking rates have dropped to 18 percent in 2014, from 43 percent in 1965, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and experts predict that rate to dip below 10 percent in the next decade. Ditching cigarettes allows CVS to trade a small — less than 2 percent of revenue — and shrinking part of its business for an instant enhancement of its credentials in the faster-growing health and wellness space.
In October, CVS announced that its Caremark arm would require some of its customers to make higher co-payments for prescriptions filled at pharmacies that still sold tobacco products — in effect driving more traffic to the now tobacco-free CVS pharmacies. While that move encourages pharmacies to quit selling tobacco, it also raised the ire of an antitrust law research firm, which called the announcement “a smokescreen” that masks higher costs for those who fill prescriptions at competing pharmacies.
“CVS’s use of its market power to bludgeon consumers and rivals into ending tobacco sales is not a legitimate form of competition,” the American Antitrust Institute said in a statement. It has urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate.
In general, CVS’s new anti-tobacco stance has helped it forge affiliations with regional hospitals. Before CVS went tobacco-free, negotiations with local health systems were awkward, Mr. Merlo said during a recent analyst conference call.
“That question would always come up — ‘You guys sell tobacco products, don’t you?’ — and that literally sucks all the energy out of the room,” Mr. Merlo said. But since the company stopped selling tobacco, he said, “We’ve been able to accelerate partnerships with leading health systems across the country.”
A new partnership with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago will involve patient referrals and shared electronic health records. Anthony Perry, vice president for ambulatory care and population health at Rush, said that traditional health care providers and companies like CVS could be natural allies.
“Take people with high blood pressure. That’s the type of thing you manage steadily over time, and you work on things like diet and exercise, and lifestyle changes, and if those things don’t work, you get into the world of medications,” he said. “What we asked was: If we’re going to do a series of visits with somebody, might they be able to do some of that closer to home?”
The flip side, he said, is that CVS can refer people with more serious ailments, but no primary care doctor, to Rush. “So CVS can now say: You need to see a primary care doctor, and we can connect you.”
The anti-tobacco stand has had other effects. Notably, the company has had to start thinking about other unhealthy items on its shelves. If it is a company that promotes health, can it also sell sugary sodas and candy bars?
The downtown Manhattan store where Ms. Foulkes walked the aisles is one of 500 locations that CVS is remodeling to emphasize healthy fare.
“I was in Long Island the day after the tobacco announcement, and I ran into a store manager who said: ‘I’m so proud of the company,’ ” she recalled. “But he also said, ‘I’m hearing customers now saying, why don’t you have healthier food?’ ”
“Customers quickly made the leap. They expected more from us,” she said.
Ms. Foulkes pointed to a prominent snack corner at the front of the store.
“What you’ll see in our stores are brands that convey healthy without being overly edgy. It’s Chobani yogurt, it’s Kind bars, it’s lots of proteins and nuts,” she said. “Health for the masses.”
At this point, there are no plans to stop selling high-fat or high-sugar snacks, still a big part of CVS stores’ sales. But they might be harder to spot.
When asked where the Oreos were, she smiled. “You’ll find them, but you’ll have to look for them.”

The contract, which is the first phase of a project that is estimated to cost $9 billion over its 18-year span, pitted a consortium that includes Cerner, based in Kansas City, Mo., against a team led by its main rival, Epic Systems.
But even before a winner was announced, some observers were doubtful that the department could achieve its goal of seamlessly exchanging the medical records of its employees, retirees and families.
One of the primary objectives is to allow the Defense Department and the Veterans Affairs Department to electronically transmit records to each other — a function they currently cannot do.
“If we allow the D.O.D. to put in a system that then can’t interconnect, that is not interoperable with other systems, that will be a big mistake,” said Representative Phil Roe, a Republican from Tennessee who is a physician and serves on the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “If we have to go to the appropriations committee and cut the money off and get them to slow down and reassure us that this won’t be a big mess, that’s what we’ll do.”
In recent years, hospitals and physicians’ offices across the country, spurred by a $30 billion incentive payment program included in the 2009 economic stimulus bill, have raced to meet deadlines for installing some sort of electronic health record. The goal was twofold: to reduce overall health care costs by eliminating unnecessary duplications of tests and to improve coordination of patient care.
The reality has fallen somewhat short. Among the chief complaints have been that the costly systems are difficult to use and, in some cases, unable to share patient records with other systems.
Cerner, an electronic health records vendor founded in 1979, teamed up with Accenture Federal Services and the military computing contractor Leidos for its bid.
A competing vendor, AllScripts, and its team were also among the three finalists, but many believed Epic Systems to be the leading candidate. The privately held company, based in Verona, Wis., says it holds the health records of nearly half of the country, and many of the nation’s largest hospital systems, including Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles, the Yale New Haven Health System and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, use the vendor.
For its bid, Epic joined with IBM.
Cerner declined to discuss details of the contract. An Epic executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The first phase of the program, the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization, involves a 10-year contract with a $4.3 billion cap that covers the first decade of services, according to the announcement.

Three days after Gov. Greg Abbott announced his decision to end Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, state health department investigators showed up on Thursday at Planned Parenthood health centers in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Brownsville with orders to turn over thousands of pages of documents, including patients’ records and employees’ home addresses and telephone numbers.
Some, but not all, of the extensive records sought by the state related specifically to abortion.
For example, Planned Parenthood South Texas was told to produce five years of records — whether electronic, paper or ultrasound — concerning any patients billed to Medicaid who had an abortion in which any part of the fetus was removed or preserved for research use. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast was to turn over a complete copy of certain patients’ records, including doctors’ orders, nursing notes and lab tests, as well as the center’s appointment books, patient sign-in sheets and contracts.
“We’re concerned about the breadth and depth of what they’re asking for,” said Sarah Wheat, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.
The battle over Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood has been at a high pitch nationwide since the release, starting in July, of videos secretly taken by abortion opponents posing as representatives of a biomedical firm seeking fetal tissue. The videos purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to illegally profit from the sale of fetal tissue, and their release has led many states to question whether Planned Parenthood should be eligible for continued Medicaid funding.
The organization said that the videos were heavily edited, and that it never violated federal law regarding the use of fetal tissue in medical research.
Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana have also moved to cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood; the group has filed suit to stop the cuts in each of those states. In Texas, the group has 30 days to appeal the Medicaid termination.
In the notice of Medicaid termination that the Texas inspector general for the state’s Health and Human Services Commission, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., sent Monday to the Planned Parenthood affiliates, he said the state had determined that the group was “no longer capable of performing medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal and ethical manner.”
The notices cited two reasons for that decision: First, they said the videos showed that the organization had a policy of altering its abortion procedures to better procure fetal tissue, in violation of medical standards. In addition, they said the videos showed people posing as buyers of fetal tissue being allowed to handle bloody tissue wearing only gloves, in violation of infection-control standards.
The notices also said that the state had found a pattern of illegal billing practices that amounted to Medicaid fraud.
Chris Cutrone, a spokesman for the inspector general, said he could not discuss the Planned Parenthood investigation or what the health investigators were looking for in their orders to turn over records.
Planned Parenthood said it saw the record requests as a politically motivated fishing expedition — and one more battle in the state’s long fight to limit abortion.
“It is completely outrageous that Texas officials are using thoroughly discredited, fraudulent videos to cut women off from preventive health care, including cancer screening, H.I.V. testing and birth control,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.
Some Texas Democrats, too, objected.
“This is a gross invasion of client privacy, and I’m tired of watching low-income women become collateral damage in attacks on Planned Parenthood that are based on deceptive videos and political grandstanding,” State Senator José Rodríguez, chairman of the Texas Senate Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. “Texas should be increasing access to women’s health care and expanding Medicaid in order to take better care of our mothers and sisters, not shutting down health clinics and intimidating women from seeking services.”
The inspector general said termination of Medicaid for Planned Parenthood would not affect access to care in Texas because there were thousands of alternative providers. But after Texas barred Planned Parenthood from participating in the state’s Women’s Health Program two years ago, a state health department report found that the program served 30,000 fewer women, with the biggest drops in areas where a Planned Parenthood clinic had been forced to close.
In the past, two federal appeals courts have blocked laws excluding abortion providers from Medicaid in Indiana and Arizona. Medicaid rules say states are not permitted to prevent providers from participating solely on the basis of the range of medical services they provide.
In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal expected to end Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid funding on Monday. But a federal judge, John W. deGravelles, delayed the termination on Sunday. In language that left little doubt about the outcome, the judge ruled that the funding must continue for at least two weeks until a final ruling. Planned Parenthood, he said, would most likely be able to prove that the attempt to end its funding was motivated by reasons unrelated to its competence.
“Uncontradicted evidence in the record at this time is that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast does not perform abortions in Louisiana, is not involved in the sale of fetal tissue, and none of the conduct in question occurred at the P.P.G.C.’s two Louisiana facilities,” he wrote.
Other states have also grappled with the fallout of the videos. Officials in six states — Missouri, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and South Dakota — opened investigations into Planned Parenthood’s practices with fetal tissue and found no wrongdoing. Another seven states declined to investigate, finding no grounds for suspicion.
In an effort to quiet the controversy, Planned Parenthood said Oct. 13 that although it had never violated federal law, it would no longer accept reimbursement for the costs of providing fetal tissue, which made up only a tiny portion of the revenue of the one California affiliate that took reimbursement.

The system’s leaders said their central goal was to teach Kaiser’s model of integrated care to a new generation of doctors who will be under pressure to improve health outcomes and control costs by working in teams and using technology.
“Health care is evolving at a very, very rapid pace in our country and we have a model of care that’s increasingly being looked to as an answer,” said Dr. Edward M. Ellison, executive medical director for the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, who is helping to oversee the medical school’s creation.
Kaiser already trains about 600 medical residents in its own program, and several thousand more complete a portion of their training in it each year. But its medical school, planned for Southern California, would be one of the first run by an integrated health system without an academic partner, said Dr. George E. Thibault, president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, which encourages innovation in medical schools.
“If health care is increasingly going to take place in integrated systems,” Dr. Thibault said, “a large part of the medical education experience should be what it’s like to work in a system like that: the efficiencies and the processes and the ways in which patient care is benefited.”
Dr. Thibault added that while Kaiser would not be the only integrated health system involved in medical education, it is “larger than any of them, has greater reach than any of them, greater resources.”
Kaiser runs 38 hospitals in eight states and the District of Columbia, with 18,000 doctors working for its affiliated medical groups and more than 10 million patients, mostly in California. It receives a fixed amount for medical care per member, so there is a strong financial incentive to keep people healthy and out of the hospital, a model that Kaiser pioneered and that is now being followed around the country.
Dr. Ellison said Kaiser’s use of technology, through electronic medical records and new types of telemedicine that allow patients to receive “care anywhere in a way that’s safe and effective,” will also be crucial to its medical school curriculum.
Kaiser officials would not provide a cost estimate for the medical school. Dr. Ellison said the goal was to have 46 students in the first class and said the school would be in California because it was “where we have our largest footprint as an organization.”
Twenty accredited medical schools have opened in the nation since 2002, for a total of 145, said Dr. John E. Prescott, chief academic officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges.

At one point a nursing student, together with a more senior nurse, rolled a computer on wheels into the room and asked my friend to rate her pain on a scale of 1 to 10.
She mumbled, “4 to 5.” The student put 5 into the computer — and then they left, without further inquiring about, or relieving, my friend’s pain.
This is not an anecdote about nurses not doing their jobs; it’s an illustration of what our jobs have become in the age of electronic health records. Computer documentation in health care is notoriously inefficient and unwieldy, but an even more serious problem is that it has morphed into more than an account of our work; it has replaced the work itself.
Our charting, rather than our care, is increasingly what we are evaluated on. When my hospital switched to bar code scanning for medication administration, not only were the nurses on my floor rated as “red,” “yellow” or “green” based on the percentage of meds we scanned, but those ratings were prominently and openly displayed on printouts left at the nurses’ station.
Or consider “fall assessments,” which a nurse uses to determine a patient’s risk of falling while in the hospital — a problem that accounts for 11,000 deaths annually. The assessments ask about medication, mobility issues and confusion to create a “fall risk score,” which then generates an appropriate menu of interventions.
A nurse could spend 10 minutes documenting a patient’s fall risk, or 10 minutes trying to keep patients from falling. It seems obvious that a computer record of “fall risk” cannot in and of itself prevent falls, but completing those records is considered essential in hospitals. As a result, real fall-prevention efforts — encouraging patients to use the call light, ordering a bedside commode, having an aide do hourly check-ins — get short shrift.
In home hospice, where I now work, the documentation is even more onerous than in the hospital and seems even more disconnected from actual patients. Hospice care is a covered benefit under Medicare, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services maintain rigid standards for documentation. They regularly withhold reimbursement if documentation is deemed incomplete or flawed.
This paperwork may have a good intent — to prevent fraud — but in practice it gives documentary exactitude an outsize importance. A colleague doing a hospice admission wrote that a dying patient had “liver failure and renal failure,” and in a separate part of her documentation wrote the conditions in the reverse order: “renal failure and liver failure.” From a medical point of view, the order of the two is irrelevant, but her supervisor reprimanded her for the disparity, since it suggested inconsistency. The concern, of course, was that the hospice wouldn’t get paid.
Charting a hospice admission usually takes between two and four hours, and requires filling out a seemingly endless number of data fields — some of them defying logic. I once had an oxygen-dependent centenarian patient in heart failure seeking admission to hospice. The hospice physician asked for further proof that the patient met the strict standards for hospice admission. It was a weekend, and during the time it took for me to collect that information, the patient died.
The worst, though, are the health risk assessments done for patients in Medicare Advantage, a program that pays for their coverage under certain private insurance plans. These assessments include an exam, an accurate health history, and diagnosis and documentation of the most serious possible version of the patient’s illnesses. This is known as diagnosis “capture,” and the entire process is colloquially referred to as “upcoding.”
Because upcoding classifies these patients as higher risk medically, Medicare increases the reimbursement given to their insurance companies without requiring that patients’ new, more severe diagnoses be treated in any way. Independent companies exist to do these evaluations, and according to an exposé published by the Center for Public Integrity in 2014, they cost our government billions of dollars every year.
The importance of accurate medical histories for very ill patients can’t be argued, and records are often surprisingly incomplete, so there is clinical value to this highly lucrative paperwork. But it seems equally inarguable that health care reimbursements should in general be tied to actual care given to actual people, and not to documentation alone.
Electronic health records present an enticingly clean and clear vision of clinical work, whereas real patients — their histories, their bodies — are messy, confusing and unpredictable. Sadly, all the attention given to our paperwork is taking us further and further away from the difficult truth that meeting very ill patients’ needs occurs in real time with real people, not in the paperwork about them.
We need to streamline our records so that they serve just one master: the patient. We should focus on the most important information in guaranteeing accuracy of diagnosis, efficacy of treatment, continuity of care and patient safety. Otherwise the content of our care will be increasingly warped by the demands of our e-record systems — and patients like my poor friend will lie in hospital beds in pain, uncomforted by the knowledge that the electronic record of that pain is satisfyingly and exactingly complete.

Do you have diabetes? Are you taking birth control pills?
You and your doctor know the answers to these questions, and now others may too: businesses that are contracting with employers to collect and analyze employee health data. But federal privacy law does not provide safeguards for how this information is used.
A Wall Street Journal report last month looked at a company called Castlight Health, which analyzes employees’ health care claims and demographic data to make predictions about their health care needs — for instance, women who have stopped filling their birth control prescriptions might become pregnant. It then gives employees advice intended to help them get the most out of their health care benefits (if a woman stops purchasing birth control, it might send her an alert about the benefits of a preconception visit to an obstetrician). It also gives employers aggregate data on their workers, like the number of employees it predicts will become pregnant soon.
Such data, employers believe, can help reduce costs by allowing them to tailor health insurance plans to fit employee demands. Castlight, which gets information from insurers as well as from employee searches on its online platform, says it uses strict standards to make sure that employers can’t use the data to identify specific employees. But no federal law requires such safeguards. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act includes some privacy protections for patients, but it applies primarily to health care providers, not companies like Castlight.
Giving employers access to employee health information could make workers vulnerable to discrimination. The Americans With Disabilities Act prohibits employers from discriminating against workers who have disabilities, but it does not ban discrimination based on behaviors like smoking, inactivity or eating fatty foods, or based on a person’s probability of having a disability in the future.
Many states prohibit employers from firing people because they smoke. Michigan and several cities ban discrimination based on weight. But federal law offers little recourse to workers fired because of data showing a pattern of unhealthy behavior.
To address this problem, a group of legal scholars has called for federal legislation that would bar companies from hiring or firing people based on health information gleaned through health data services. It would also ensure employees’ right to see the information these services collected about them and to have that information deleted.
As data analysis techniques evolve, such services will be able to draw ever more sophisticated conclusions about people based on their health care use. Americans need federal protections to make sure that those conclusions don’t cost them their jobs.

Conway, chief medical officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, keeps one foot on the front lines as he works to improve the health system.","WASHINGTON —  On weekdays, Dr. Patrick H. Conway is one of the most powerful doctors in America, steering federal health programs that spend nearly $1 trillion a year while shaping health policies that affect tens of millions of citizens.
On many weekends, he is just another doctor in blue sterile gloves and a yellow gown with a stethoscope around his neck, comforting children and training young physicians, many of whom have no idea of his other role.
Doctors and hospital executives have long complained that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is out of touch with the real world where care is given. As the Obama administration races to reshape the nation’s disjointed, hugely expensive health care system, those complaints are widespread.
But Dr. Conway, the centers’ chief medical officer, is not a bureaucrat removed from the front lines of medicine. He treats patients every few weeks at the Children’s National Medical Center here, in addition to serving as the No. 2 official at the federal agency, which provides health insurance to one-third of all Americans.
On a recent Saturday, Dr. Conway, a pediatrician, examined a 5-month-old girl who had a heart defect and pneumonia, a cranky 2-year-old girl whose body was covered with a mysterious rash, and a 17-year-old patient with belly pain and an inflamed pancreas. (The president of the hospital, Dr. Kurt Newman, said he had not known that Dr. Conway worked there until the two encountered each other in an elevator several years ago.)
Dr. Conway, 41, has a say in almost every significant or controversial health care policy change contemplated by the Obama administration.
He is devising a new way of paying doctors under Medicare, as required by a 2015 law, the biggest change in payment policy since 1992. He is responsible for deciding whether Medicare will pay for new items and services, like PET scans to help detect Alzheimer’s disease, or counseling patients about end-of-life care. He also leads efforts to measure the quality of care provided by doctors and hospitals, so the government can tie its payments to their performance.
And by using financial rewards and penalties, he is trying to nudge doctors and hospitals to provide better, safer, more coordinated care at a lower cost.
“Our fee-for-service system is broken,” Dr. Conway said. “It causes fragmented care. It pays not for outcomes but for outputs. It causes volume-driven care. So the question is, ‘How do we shift that payment model?’ ”
Dr. Conway said his experience at the children’s hospital here had contributed directly to changes in federal policy, including a new rule that expanded the role of dietitians. In addition, he said, “using electronic health records as a physician in practice has informed the way I think about policy, both what’s good and what needs to be improved” — to ensure that electronic records “do not disrupt the doctor-patient experience.”
Some experts say federal efforts to measure the quality of care, though well intentioned, are out of control.
“We need to stop excessive measurement,” said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, who headed the Medicare agency in 2010-11 and recruited Dr. Conway to be the chief medical officer. “I vote for a 50 percent reduction in all metrics currently being used.”
The National Academy of Sciences has expressed concern about the proliferation of quality measures, including nearly 1,700 used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Many doctors doubt whether the government can reliably assess their performance. In the second round of incentive payments, announced this month, far more doctors received financial penalties than bonuses.
“It’s like a lottery,” said Anders M. Gilberg, senior vice president of the Medical Group Management Association, referring to the payments. His organization represents physician groups.
Despite skepticism or outright resistance from some health care providers, Dr. Conway exudes a boyish enthusiasm for his work.
He acknowledges that critics have a point. “We do want to focus on smaller sets of measures when possible,” he said. He promised that the government would concentrate more on the results of care, not just whether doctors gave the recommended tests and treatments.
Consumer advocates like Debra L. Ness, the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, see Dr. Conway as a kindred spirit who understands what is important to patients. “He has the experience of being a clinician, a direct provider of health care services, but also has an incredible grasp of the administrative and policy aspects of health care,” Ms. Ness said.
Some of that insight comes from firsthand experience. Dr. Conway was expelled from the delivery room when his wife received an epidural injection while giving birth to their fourth child last year.
“C.M.S. says you have to leave the room,” said a nurse anesthetist, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Conway complied with the request, he said, though he later checked and found that the agency had no such regulation.
Dr. Conway was the youngest of four children, and he realized that he liked working with children when he was a camp counselor in his teens. He received his bachelor’s degree at Texas A & M, where his father was a chemistry professor and his mother was an assistant dean at the business school. He went to Baylor College of Medicine and did his residency at Boston Children’s Hospital, where he met his wife, Heather, a pediatric intensive care nurse.
In 2007, during the Bush administration, he came to Washington as a White House fellow and worked for Michael O. Leavitt, who was then the secretary of health and human services.
“I have no idea whether Patrick is a Republican or a Democrat,” Mr. Leavitt said. “He came to government not for politics, but for policy.” Voter registration records list the doctor as unaffiliated with any political party.
When Dr. Conway speaks to groups of doctors or hospital executives, they often complain that federal rules are rigid and oppressive. But he has a way of disarming critics.
After one speech, he recalled, a doctor buttonholed him and said: “I always thought C.M.S. was evil. But you’re not evil. You seem very nice. I could work with you.”
His zeal to improve care is rooted in personal experience. He was frustrated, he said, at the fragmented care that his father, Dwight Conway, received when he was dying of cancer in 2007.
He promised his father that he would devote his life to trying to fix the health care system. His father told him: “You can’t. It’s too hard. But you are persistent. If anyone can, it would be you.”
Dr. Conway also supervises the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, a test bed for new ways of financing and delivering care. In one such project, Medicare will make a “bundled payment” for hip and knee replacement surgery and 90 days of follow-up care, forcing hospitals to work more closely with doctors, nursing homes and home health agencies.
Federal officials are continually trying to measure the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, and Dr. Conway applies similar techniques to his personal life. He has a large whiteboard at work to keep track of office projects, and on one side is a mission statement he and his wife wrote, outlining objectives for family life, including ways to be a good father and husband.
“He evaluates his performance against those objectives,” said Wesley R. Perich, a former deputy in the office. Using one such metric, Dr. Conway said, he got home for dinner with his family about 75 percent of the time.
Some doctors worry that the administration is trying to do too much too fast, without considering the effects on patients.
“Dr. Conway is a very smart man, and he is trying lots of innovative programs and ideas,” said Dr. Thomas C. Barber, the chairman of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons’ Council on Advocacy. “But some of those ideas are being implemented before they are ready.”
Among those providing unvarnished feedback to Dr. Conway is his sister, Dr. Kathleen C. Jurell, who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation.
“I hear from her about C.M.S.,” he said, “and it’s not always good.”

It can also happen with medical devices, though you’d think lifesaving devices like heart defibrillators or artificial hips would be closely monitored.
But the data needed to systematically and rapidly identify dangerous medical devices are not routinely collected in the United States.
It wouldn’t be that hard to do.
Problems with medical devices are not infrequent. Defibrillators implanted in nearly 200,000 patients were recalled in 2011 because of a faulty part. More recently, the Essure birth control device implanted in women’s fallopian tubes has been associated with pain and deaths. Improper handling of duodenoscopes — used by doctors to examine the small intestine — was linked to hundreds of cases of antibiotic-resistant infections in 2013 and 2014.
According to a report from the Brookings Institution, medical device problems that we know about contribute to about 3,000 deaths per year in the United States. There may be many more we do not know about because we do not track medical device use the way we track prescription drugs for quality and safety. Codes that uniquely identify prescribed drugs are routinely included in medical claims data — such as those made public by the Medicare program. These can be mined for signals of problems.
Instead, for medical devices, we rely on a passive system that’s not up to the task. Hospitals, nursing homes and medical device manufacturers and importers are required to notify the Food and Drug Administration of device safety problems. Doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are not. The F.D.A. has characterized the data collected through these channels as potentially “incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, unverified or biased.”
Reflecting this haphazard approach, a Senate report released this year accused Olympus, a Japanese manufacturer of contaminated duodenoscopes, of delayed reporting of known problems and chided the F.D.A. for its lethargic investigation of them. The report also found that none of the hospitals where problems surfaced properly documented them. Experts convened by the F.D.A. excoriated the manufacturer of the Essure birth control device for not collecting data that could have detected its risks.
The solution seems simple: Do for devices what we do for drugs. The F.D.A. has established the Sentinel Initiative to mine medical data to confirm or clear suspected problematic drugs. For example, one inquiry confirmed reports of intestinal problems associated with an antihypertensive drug. Another investigated whether a new anticoagulant drug was associated with a higher risk of bleeding than others.
We can’t have a Sentinel Initiative for medical devices in the United States because unique device identifiers are not required to be included in standardized medical claims data. Though claims reveal what procedure is performed on which patient, they do not indicate what exact devices were used — like which of the dozens of makes and models of artificial hip was implanted in a hip replacement. (There are plans to make it easier for hospitals to use their electronic records to track which devices are used in which patients, but those records are not standardized — as claims data are — and do not fully integrate with those from other systems, severely limiting their use for surveillance and patient safety.)
Other nations have detected issues with such monitoring systems before American doctors and patients were probably aware of them. For instance, systems in Australia and England and Wales led to the discovery of problems with metal-on-metal artificial hip joints, before the F.D.A. called for a review of them and they were recalled in the United States. A Swedish system  associated early drug-coated stents with increased risk of death compared with conventional bare-metal stents.
High-risk medical devices already include unique identifiers and bar codes similar to those on drug packaging and suitable for tracking. In the coming years, other devices will include them as well. Some members of Congress favor including device identifiers in medical claims, and F.D.A. Commissioner Robert Califf supports the approach. Peter Orszag, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget, reported in a Bloomberg View column last year that many medical societies, insurers and health care providers support it as well.
Not everyone agrees. The American Hospital Association and Marilyn Tavenner, while she was administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, expressed concerns, citing higher costs.
The price tag for a medical device surveillance system that relies on such data is about $50 million a year. This does not include the one-time costs hospitals would have to pay to adapt to the system. Even at a multiple of the price, however, if it saved only a few tens of lives — and chances are it would save many more than that — it would be considered cost-effective. The defective defibrillators cost Medicare an estimated $287 million. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, Daniel Levinson, says that faulty medical devices have cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
A significant limitation of medical surveillance systems is that their findings rely on correlations that may not be indicative of causation. However, as I and Steven Pizer, a Northeastern University health economist, noted in the American Journal of Managed Care, the point of such surveillance is to use a large amount of data to detect problems missed by more rigorous, but necessarily smaller, randomized trials. Statistical techniques can increase confidence that correlations from surveillance systems imply a causal relationship (when they really do) or cast doubt (when they don’t).
Medical devices are intended to cure, but some may cause harm. We’re not collecting the data that would help us know the difference.

So when Geisinger requested a rate increase of 40 percent for 2017, consumer advocates were amazed. And Kurt J. Wrobel, Geisinger’s chief actuary, found himself, along with other members of his profession, in the middle of the health care wars still raging in this political year.
Actuaries normally toil far from the limelight, anonymous technicians stereotyped as dull and boring. But as they crunch the numbers for their Affordable Care Act business, their calculations are feeding a roaring national debate over insurance premiums, widely used to gauge the success of President Obama’s health care law. Health plans around the country have just filed proposed rates for 2017. State insurance commissioners are still reviewing them.
But questions about the proposed increases are reverberating through the health care system and into the political campaign.
“Historical experience is the lifeblood of what we do,” Mr. Wrobel said, in an interview at Geisinger’s headquarters here. “We take that experience, adjust it for the underlying growth of health costs and project it into the future so we can estimate the expected costs for a particular insurance policy.”
Such niceties may be lost in this scorching campaign season. “There is panic and anger as health care costs explode!” Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote in a recent Twitter post, seizing on increases of nearly 60 percent sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas.
Obama administration officials are more sanguine. Consumers, they say, should not worry. Proposed rate increases are often reduced by state officials. Federal subsidies will generally rise along with premiums, offsetting much of the additional costs, and consumers can, in any event, switch to cheaper health plans next year.
But as they prepare for the fourth year of coverage under the Affordable Care Act, many insurers are struggling to find the best ways of providing care to their new customers. The giant UnitedHealth Group, having lost money on individual policies under the federal health law, is pulling out of many insurance exchanges next year. A number of health insurance cooperatives created under the law have shut down.
Geisinger is different. During debate on the 2010 health care law, Mr. Obama and members of Congress repeatedly hailed it as a model providing “high-quality care at costs well below average,” in the president’s words.
Geisinger serves residents of rural central and northeast Pennsylvania, and its roots in the community are as deep as the coal mines that once flourished here.
Dr. David T. Feinberg, the president and chief executive of the Geisinger Health System, said its health plan was losing $30 million a year on coverage sold on the federal exchange in Pennsylvania. But leaving the market here would be unthinkable.
“For its shareholders, United made the right decision,” Dr. Feinberg said, “but we don’t answer to shareholders. We answer to the nice people of Danville, Shamokin and Bloomsburg.”
It would be difficult to find a health plan more aligned with the goals of the federal law. The Obama administration recruited a former chief executive of the Geisinger Health Plan, Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, to be the first director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, created by the health law to test ways to improve care and cut costs.
Geisinger has been a pioneer in the use of electronic health records and genomic medicine, recruiting 100,000 patients for DNA sequencing studies in the last two years. It has embraced “pay for performance,” offering a warranty for major surgical procedures and promising not to charge extra if complications occur.
But innovation has been no match for the actuarial surprises dealt out by the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Wrobel said Geisinger had simply underestimated how much care its new customers would need.
“Our rates for Medicare, Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance have been relatively stable, but those products have to bear the cost of our losses on exchange business,” Mr. Wrobel said.
Last October the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, headed by a former Obama administration official, approved a 20 percent increase in Geisinger’s rates, about half of what the company had requested.
“But based on experience,” Mr. Wrobel said, “the 2016 premium rate is too low, so we want to correct it in 2017.”
Julia T. Philips, an award-winning actuary who worked 19 years for the state of Minnesota, said insurance regulators generally do not let a company make up for past losses with future rate increases.
“But regulators often allow companies to catch up,” she said. “If you assumed that claims would average $400 per member per month in 2015 and the actual cost was $440, you can use the higher number as a starting point in predicting claims costs for 2017.”
Obama administration officials suggest that insurance companies seeking big rate increases have been slow to adapt to the new law. But Geisinger executives welcome innovation, and they have celebrated the reduction in the number of uninsured under the Affordable Care Act.
Geisinger is not alone. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department says insurers have proposed premium increases averaging 23.6 percent for individual coverage for 2017.
“People with pre-existing conditions are now getting treatment,” said Antoinette Kraus, the director of a statewide consumer group, the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, “and it’s more expensive because they were shut out of the market for many years.”
But, she added, “we expect that they’ll eventually become healthier, so we won’t see these huge rate increases every year.”
Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, acknowledged that “pent-up demand for health care is greater than people expected and is lasting longer than expected.”
In April, before most insurers had filed their rate requests for 2017, the Obama administration began a campaign to play down their significance. “Proposed rates aren’t what consumers pay,” the Department of Health and Human Services said. “Most people receive tax credits and can buy a plan for less than $75 per month.”
Moreover, the administration says that the health law created a competitive market in which consumers can shop for the best deal. As evidence that this market is working, the administration boasts that more than 40 percent of returning consumers switched to different plans for 2016.
However, Mr. Wrobel said, such turnover is making it more difficult for insurers to predict costs. “The whole point of what we do, the foundation of good health insurance,” he said, “is to develop long-term relationships with our members and to make long-term investments in their health. It’s not like buying a book on Amazon.”
Besides, he said, substantial numbers of consumers do not receive subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 12 million people will receive subsidies, in the form of tax credits, next year. But it says that an equal number — three million on the exchanges and nine million buying insurance outside the exchanges — will have to pay the full unsubsidized price.
“When we developed rates for 2014,” Mr. Wrobel said, “we had no historical data. It was basically an educated guess.”
Mr. Wrobel said rates were still being affected by a federal policy, adopted in late 2013, that allowed some people to keep and renew insurance that did not meet standards in the Affordable Care Act. “Healthier people chose to keep their plans,” he said, “so the collective cost of care for people buying insurance on the exchange was higher than expected.”
Many insurers hope to profit from the Affordable Care Act, but for Geisinger, the calculus is a little different.
“Geisinger has been here for 100 years, and we expect to be here another hundred,” Mr. Wrobel said. “We are going to be taking care of the people in this community one way or another. So it’s really important for this program to be financially stable and sustainable.”

Thatâ€™s Fiction,57d113ab95d0e021d7984fb2,"subject:Electronic Health Records, persons:Clinton, Hillary Rodham, subject:Presidential Election of 2016, persons:Trump, Donald J, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Privacy",Business,7.76e-06,None,"Hillary Clintonâ€™s records are in bits and pieces, in file cabinets and computers, just like yours.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/upshot/release-your-medical-records-first-you-must-collect-them.html,1042,"Hillary Clinton’s records are in bits and pieces, in file cabinets and computers, just like yours.","One of Donald J. Trump’s recent attack lines against Hillary Clinton focuses on her health: If she has nothing to hide, he asks in a tweet, why doesn’t she release her medical records to the public?
For the moment, put aside Mr. Trump’s own revelations about his medical history, which consist of a hyperbolic, undated letter with little detail from his gastroenterologist. And put aside Mrs. Clinton’s own recent disclosures, which include a somewhat more detailed accounting of her health and medication history from the internist who has overseen her care in recent years. Put aside, finally, the question of whether complete medical records would allay the conspiracy theories of some of Mrs. Clinton’s critics, who say a recent cough is a sign of disqualifying illness or believe she experienced a seizure during a recent news conference.
Instead, assume that Mrs. Clinton wished to take Mr. Trump’s request seriously, and release full and detailed medical records. It would not be easy, even for a V.I.P. with an army of staffers. Mrs. Clinton is 68 years old, has lived in multiple states and been treated by many doctors and hospitals over the years. The notion of a single file, containing “medical records,” is a fiction. Her medical records are in bits and pieces, in doctors’ filing cabinets, hospital records departments, and in hard-to-access computers. Just like yours, probably.
The federal government has invested billions in helping to digitize medical records, but the process is still in its infancy, with data that is often nonstandard and hard to transfer between systems. And even as a growing number of medical professionals have made the transition to digital records, most of our medical histories exist only in the old world of paper, assuming they still exist at all. (Mrs. Clinton’s pediatrician is unlikely to still be alive, and records of Mrs. Clinton’s possible polio vaccination or childhood ear infections may be lost to history.)
“Getting someone’s records is a nightmare, because they are in paper, and they’re scattered everywhere,” said Dr. William Tierney, the department chairman of population health at the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas, who has studied and worked on electronic health records systems, and used them as a physician.
Obtaining a complete set of Mrs. Clinton’s health records would require a perfect accounting of every doctor’s office she has visited in her life, and then requests for copies of the records that still exist. Collecting records can be challenging for patients: Doctors and hospitals, fearful of inadvertently violating federal medical privacy laws or simply reluctant to put in the legwork, often refuse to email or even mail records to patients. And even when medical providers comply with requests, the results can be confusing and inconvenient — requiring fax machines, CD-ROM discs with unfamiliar file formats, or photocopies of pages in a physician’s scrawl.
“Average people encounter a huge amount of difficulty,” said David Blumenthal, a former national coordinator for health information technology for the Obama administration, now president of the Commonwealth Fund. He said he had heard countless stories of patients sent to the basement and asked to pay by the page for printouts of digital records.
Good luck reading those records when you get them: pages of lab readings, check-box answers, billing codes and illegible handwriting. Few patients can understand the records, and neither can many physicians. That’s why, even in the most wired of medical offices, receptionists still hand you a clipboard and ask you to write your medical history before the doctor will see you.
“It’s the last bastion of paper,” said Casey Quinlan, a Virginia-based writer who became a patient advocate after the frustrations of managing care for her parents and then herself, when she was treated for breast cancer. “The fax machine is still strong in this one.”
Ms. Quinlan, who travels to health and technology conferences arguing for a better system, has had a large QR code — a type of bar code to store and track data — tattooed on her sternum. Medical providers are invited to scan the image, which she linked to a password-protected site with key medical information.
In 1999 and again in 2008, Senator John McCain released more than a thousand pages of his medical records to reporters. But his was the exception that proved the rule. A Navy veteran and a former prisoner of war, Mr. McCain was part of a long-term study in the military health system, so many of the relevant records really were all in one place. But in later years, he was treated at the Mayo Clinic, and the campaign said it had been forced to postpone the records release because of difficulties with wrangling different doctors within that one system.
By historical standards, neither candidate in this election has been particularly forthcoming about matters of health, despite being older than typical for the job they seek. While candidates in the past may not have published comprehensive reams of documents, most did provide more than a short doctor’s note. Given the complexity of collecting and interpreting medical records, something in between might help the public better assess the health of the candidates hoping to lead the country. (Dan Diamond at Politico recently wrote about one intriguing idea: a panel of independent physicians who would evaluate every candidate on the public’s behalf.)
But if the standard is detailed medical records, Mr. Trump might also struggle with the same challenges of technology, logistics and clarity that afflict college freshmen trying to confirm their vaccination records; or weekend warriors wishing to bring an M.R.I. to a sports medicine doctor; or cancer patients seeking a second opinion. Or anyone with a chronic illness who has ever moved. (Even someone with “astonishingly excellent” test results has probably seen a few medical providers in 70 years.)
Dr. Tierney worked for years in Indiana to help the state develop a cutting-edge health information exchange, a place where most of the state’s hospitals shared patients’ medical data. After 44 years in the state, he queried the exchange for his records before leaving. He paid $100 for an inch-and-a-half-thick stack of papers.
“I went to my new doctor,” he said. “I put it on the table. And she said, fill out the form.”

But why not try?","When Donald Trump challenged Hillary Clinton to a medical records disclosure throwdown not long ago, my colleague Margot Sanger-Katz wrote an article pointing out that there’s often no such thing as a complete medical dossier on anyone.
After all, most of us have seen many doctors over many decades, with details scattered hither and yon. Tracking them down would be a nightmare, the specialists in medical records and technology say.
But that kind of quest is my kind of fun. So this week, I spent three full days pestering my pediatrician in Chicago for immunization records and wandering New York in search of the travel medicine specialist I saw in 2005. Then, I tried to figure out what life insurance underwriters would find out from services that gather prescription drug histories upon request. (Yes, such things exist, and you’re allowed to see what’s in them.)
I did not finish. Many doctors keep records in storage, and insurance companies need lots of time to look things up. But once everything is in hand, I will know what that drug was that did not work and be able to correct any database errors that make me look like a bad insurance bet.
This is an exercise that most people could benefit from. So here are the steps I took and the obstacles I encountered along the way.
PEDIATRICIAN This was an excuse to catch up with Dr. Frederick M. Cahan, “Uncle Fred” to me as I was growing up. He’s a family friend and still plying his trade.
He’s also a self-described hoarder, but he did not have my records. Within minutes, however, he put his hands on those of my twin siblings, who were born in 1976. So if you’re 40 and under, you might call the medical professional who gave you your first talk about “funny” cigarettes.
INSURANCE The biggest mystery I hoped to solve was that of occasional (and still unexplained) elevated liver enzymes. The result showed up in a 2006 life insurance medical screening. At some point after that, I saw a specialist and had an ultrasound, which didn’t show anything alarming.
But who was the doctor? There was nothing in my filing cabinet at home, and my primary care physician had no record of referring me. I was pretty sure that Aetna was my insurance provider at the time. Could it send me copies of every explanation of benefit it had ever produced for me?
The phone representative was encouraging, but first I had to sign a release. I had the choice of faxing it back or dropping it in the mail, and I chose fax. The reply would take weeks.
As soon as I started in with the various fax machines in my office, however, I knew I’d made a mistake. The first didn’t work. The second, a combination copier-fax-scanner, screeched a bit, at which point I remembered the stories I’d read about how they store images and leave users vulnerable to identity theft. That one didn’t seem to work either, so I moved to Machine 3.
The next day, a colleague approached my desk. She handed me 53 copies of the Aetna form, each of which had my Social Security number and date of birth on it. Machine 2 had belched them out, one by one, at some indeterminate point.
DATABASES I also hoped to figure out what drug I took in 2009 that did not agree with me. What was it again? At first, I couldn’t remember the name of the doctor who had prescribed it, so I checked in with two companies that provide reports on people’s prescription records. They sell access to life and other insurance companies, which ask applicants to grant them permission to do a sort of medical background check.
“Wouldn’t it be great if you could gather deeper insights into your applicant’s potential mortality risk?” the website of one of the services, ScriptCheck, cheerily asks insurance companies. It would also be great if consumers could see what ScriptCheck has on them, but the website doesn’t offer any information on how to do so. So here’s the phone number to request a free report: 844-225-8047.
I wasn’t able to get this one right away, but it turns out that I’m destined for disappointment. A spokeswoman for ScriptCheck’s owner, Quest Diagnostics, told me that the outgoing message on the above phone number’s voice mail asks for your insurance company’s name for a reason: ScriptCheck will give you only the prescription data that it gave the insurance company, going back seven years. So a request next week based on a 2013 insurance application will yield information from the application date and before. And my hunt for 2009 data based on my last life insurance application, which was in 2006, would yield nothing.
A ScriptCheck competitor, IntelliScript, moves more quickly and offers information for consumers on its website. Within 24 hours, I got an email response letting me know that the company had no information on me in its files.
According to the FAQ page on its website, no report exists until an insurance company asks for one. IntelliScript would not comment on why it had no information about me. It and ScriptCheck get their information from pharmacy benefit managers, who are legally allowed to pass it on.
I also requested my file from MIB, an organization of insurers, which may contain other data on my medical and insurance history. It, too, takes some time to arrive.
MENTAL HEALTH Intensely curious about what, if anything, your therapist is scribbling down about you? Alas, the federal law that grants you the right to request your medical records specifically gives mental health practitioners permission to withhold their psychotherapy notes.
According to the American Psychological Association, some state regulations may make it easier to get these notes. If you don’t believe that any observations in the file could lead to a psychological setback, ask for the notes and see what happens, keeping in mind that some notes may have been early musings about diagnoses that did not turn out to be accurate.
DOCTORS My encounters with various physicians yielded mixed results, and it didn’t always depend on the age of the records. My primary care doctor was an early adopter of electronic medical records, and I was able to confirm via his website that my last liver test several years ago was normal.
For another physician, who I’ve seen intermittently for back trouble over the years and visited once in the last year, I had to make my records request via fax. The person answering the phone at his office would not let me make my request by email.
This year, I broke a bone in my arm, so I wanted a scan of the initial X-ray. I thought I could show up at the office and scan the image with my phone, but the rules there prevented it. Instead, I have to wait for a full copy of the X-ray, which I don’t actually want.
But at least it was available. No one gave me a hard time for merely making these requests, which is a good thing, since federal law generally requires health practitioners to hand over your records, though they are allowed to charge reasonable copying and mailing fees. Only one of my doctors charged me anything, but it can be costly for people with more extensive records.
My best luck came in the place where I had the lowest expectations. I knew I’d had a round of travel vaccinations in 2005, but I wasn’t sure where, and my filing cabinet turned up nothing but an incomplete vaccination record with no doctor’s name on it. I had a vague sense that the office was in Greenwich Village, so I made a list of travel medicine specialists near there and started dropping in on them.
One looked familiar, and after talking to three people in the office and waiting around for 10 minutes, one of them ushered me to her workstation. My name didn’t turn up in her initial search, but when I told her the approximate dates of the possible visits, she started pulling thumb drives out of the top of her desk drawer. Within a few minutes, she found my file and hit the print button.
Thanks to my hounding and her doggedness, I won’t repeat the hepatitis A vaccine for at least another decade. She was pleased, too. Had the office sent all the records away to a scanning service, I asked? No, she said, she had done it all herself.
How long did that take? “Years,” she said. “Boxes and boxes and boxes.”

The federal court-appointed receiver who controls California’s inmate health care system approved the project in 2013 to replace the state’s antiquated paper-based records with an electronic system that could track the medical and mental health care of nearly 130,000 inmates.
But a year of delays means it will not be installed in all 35 prisons until the end of 2017, and inmate advocates are so concerned about problems with the new system that they may seek to push it back even longer at some prisons.
The cost ballooned to $386.5 million from the original $182 million in part because the first estimate left out basics like the cost of maintaining the system and replacing worn-out equipment.
The receiver, J. Clark Kelso, said his office had also failed to anticipate needing $13 million worth of mobile devices: 16,800 laptops, dictation machines and other gear. Nor did it include the extra software required for things as fundamental as incorporating inmates’ requests to see doctors.
The authorities added dental records to the system last year, and the latest estimate includes three additional years of operation.
“We started out with as cheap a system as we thought we could use,” Mr. Kelso said, “and then, along the way, there were some things that we decided, ‘You know, we absolutely need these, it turns out.’”
The biggest problem was a pharmaceutical records system so complex that it turned out to be nearly unusable when it was tested last winter at three prisons, Mr. Kelso said. He brought in a new pharmacy chief in February and “told him his No. 1 job is to fix this.”
The drug-tracking system is working now, bringing benefits like automatically warning doctors when certain combinations of prescriptions could prove harmful, Mr. Kelso said.
Physicians do not like that the new system forces them to do time-consuming data entry that they used to delegate to nurses, he said, though he expects them to eventually adapt.
Doctors who tested the system are still seeing about one-third fewer patients a year later, potentially leading to backlogs and poor treatment, said Steven Fama, a lawyer at the nonprofit Prison Law Office, which sued to force health care improvements.
As a result, the lawyers are considering asking Mr. Kelso to delay installing the new system at as many as nine prisons next year.
Many of the extra costs have been absorbed in the receiver’s budget, which has nearly doubled to $1.9 billion since a federal judge seized control of California’s prison medical system a decade ago.

A bacterial infection had entered his bloodstream, requiring him to spend nine days at Temple, where patients are overwhelmingly poor.
Mr. Colston, 36, had no insurance through his job at a 7-Eleven, but it turned out he was eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Temple helped him enroll as soon as he was admitted, and Medicaid paid for his stay and continuing treatment.
Before the health law, the hospital had to absorb the cost of caring for many uninsured patients like Mr. Colston. Now, with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress vowing to dismantle the law, Temple and other hospitals serving the poor are bracing for harsh financial consequences that could have a serious effect on the care they provide.
Since the election, hospitals have been among the loudest voices against wholesale repeal of the health law. In a letter to Mr. Trump and congressional leaders this month, the two biggest hospital trade groups warned of “an unprecedented public health crisis” and said hospitals stood to lose $165 billion through 2026 if more than 20 million people lose the insurance they gained under the law. They predicted widespread layoffs, cuts in outpatient care and services for the mentally ill, and even hospital closings.
Here in Pennsylvania, where the health law has brightened the financial outlook of hospitals statewide, many are scrambling to assess how repeal would affect their bottom line and the patients they serve. The stakes are particularly high for safety-net hospitals like Temple, but even more prosperous hospitals face uncertainty after investing in new ways to deliver care under the law.
Temple executives estimate their system could lose as much as $45 million a year if the law were entirely repealed, which would return it to the losses it posted for years before the health law took effect.
“We are the de facto community hospital in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country,” said Robert Lux, the senior vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Temple University Health System, which includes two general hospitals and a cancer center. “Any kind of change like this would not only push Temple University Hospital into financial extremis, it would do the same thing for our entire system.”
Not far from Temple, Main Line Health, a nonprofit hospital system in the affluent Philadelphia suburbs, is far better positioned to weather the financial impact of repeal. While Temple has one of the poorest patient populations in the state — about half of its patients are on Medicaid — Main Line, which has an outpatient clinic in an upscale mall and another with a fitness center outfitted with filtered saltwater pools, has few Medicaid patients.
Still, even hospitals serving affluent populations have reason to be nervous about a future without the health law. Main Line has invested substantially in response to the law’s push to base hospital pay on patient outcomes instead of the amount of medical services provided. Repealing the law would create uncertainty about the future of this new paradigm, which has forced hospitals to rethink how they deliver care.
“I’m dreading the unpredictability,” said John J. Lynch III, Main Line’s president and chief executive.
Over all, the health law has improved the financial outlook of Pennsylvania hospitals significantly, even though the state was a year late in expanding Medicaid. The former governor, Tom Corbett, a Republican, initially balked, and the program did not expand here until 2015. Still, hospital operating margins statewide increased to about 5.5 percent on average in 2015, from 4.25 percent in 2014, according to the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. The amount of care provided to patients who cannot pay dropped by 8.6 percent on average.
North Philadelphia, where Temple is based, is among the poorest neighborhoods in the nation. Many of its residents live in deep poverty, a census designation that means their income is less than half the federal poverty level of $24,300 for a family of four. That helps explain why Temple is so dependent on Medicaid revenue, and the high stakes of repeal here.
Under the health law, hospitals that served a large number of poor and uninsured patients agreed to a series of funding cuts in exchange for getting far more patients with insurance coverage. Temple has lost about $11 million so far in these federal funds, known as disproportionate share payments, Mr. Lux said.
But like other hospitals in the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law, it has made up that revenue in part through the Medicaid expansion. It recorded about 13,000 more visits from patients with Medicaid coverage in 2015, the first year Pennsylvania expanded Medicaid eligibility, and at least as many this year. Still, Temple is barely turning a profit: It had operating income of $3.6 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, despite revenue of $1.7 billion.
“You still have a pretty fragile enterprise,” Mr. Lux said, noting that Medicaid pays hospitals and doctors far less than Medicare and private insurance. “Our current state of stability could be broken pretty quickly.”
So, too, could Temple’s efforts to connect its newly insured patients with preventive care instead of waiting until they show up in the emergency room with advanced, expensive illnesses. Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of emergency medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, said he had seen more than a few uninsured people arrive in the emergency room with kidney failure, needing costly dialysis for the rest of their lives because they had lived with high blood pressure for so long.
Main Line Health’s financial picture is much stronger, and will most likely remain so even if the health law is repealed and replaced with a program that leaves far fewer people insured. Main Line ended the 2016 fiscal year with $106.8 million in operating income and a 6.5 percent operating margin, compared with Temple’s margin of 0.2 percent.
Still, Main Line has invested substantially in efforts to improve the care it provides its patients while lowering the cost, as the Affordable Care Act encourages. As with many hospitals across the country, these efforts — like preventing readmissions and focusing more heavily on primary care, especially for patients with chronic diseases — have caused the system’s inpatient population to drop.
“As we decrease our volume, looking at providing care differently, that’s financially impacting us,” Mr. Lynch said.
He added that over time, the law’s slowing of Medicare payment increases added up to “real money.” The study commissioned by the hospital associations found that unless the annual increase in Medicare reimbursements is restored to what it was before the health law passed, hospitals will face additional losses of about $290 billion by 2026.
In the end, though, Main Line’s far more robust revenue, because of its large number of commercially insured patients, all but guarantee it will not have to worry — for now — about cutting programs or plans. It is installing a new electronic records system and has spent $700 million renovating its hospitals over the last few years.
“If you don’t have a strong payer mix or a healthy bottom line,” Mr. Lynch said, “it’s very difficult to do those things.”
One major question for Temple and other safety-net hospitals is whether states would restore supplemental funds or programs that defrayed the cost of caring for the uninsured before the health law took effect. Pennsylvania, for example, paid for emergency medical care for certain low-income people who did not qualify for Medicaid. This allowed Temple to be paid for their inpatient care, but often not for the care they needed after being discharged.
“We don’t know that that program would come back,” Mr. Lux said, adding that the program used to pay for about $23 million a year worth of care provided at Temple University Hospital.
Mr. Colston, who was still returning daily to Temple for intravenous antibiotics a month after his discharge, would have qualified to have most of his inpatient costs met under the old state-financed program. Paul Fabian, who received a double lung transplant at Temple last year after getting a subsidized private insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act marketplace, would not have qualified at all. Mr. Fabian, who suffered from emphysema and chronic lung failure, said he sold his truck to afford his $262 monthly premiums.
“If you walk into the E.R. they have to help you,” Mr. Fabian, 61, said. “But if you have a condition like I had, what’s the hospital’s obligation?”
Temple officials said that without insurance, Mr. Fabian would have had to endure a two-year waiting period to qualify for Medicare coverage for his disability.
“We were finally in a situation where for most of our patients there was a coverage option,” said Anita Colon, Temple’s director of patient financial services, already speaking about the health law in the past tense. “Now there’s just a total unknown about what will be left.”

But hackers can get to them easily.,"THERE’S quite a paradox when it comes to our health data. Most of us still cannot readily look at it, but there’s been an epidemic of cybercriminals and thieves hacking and stealing this most personal information.
Last year hundreds of breaches involving millions of health records were reported to the Department of Health and Human Services — with the hackings  of the health insurers Anthem and Premera Blue Cross alone affecting some 90 million Americans. At least 10 hospitals and health care systems have had their patient data and information systems literally held  for ransom. This month, the national medical lab Quest Diagnostics reported that information on 34,000 patients had been stolen. And these breaches are just the ones that have been disclosed.
Why is our private health information being stolen and trafficked by cybercriminals? For one, these records include information that makes them more valuable to hackers than almost any other type of data. Thieves can use this information to order medical equipment and drugs to resell and to fraudulently bill insurance companies, the costs of which are passed along to consumers.
Second, while our personal medical data is so precious and valuable to us, it’s an exceptionally easy target for criminals. The health care industry’s focus has been on patient care rather than cybersecurity, and federal regulations intended to protect financial data do not apply to health care records. It is common for millions of patients’ health records to be stored together in huge central databases that, once breached, yield a trove of information.
It has become increasingly difficult to combat this problem using traditional methods of enforcement and deterrence. Even assuming the wrongdoers are identified, there are often jurisdictional hurdles because the thieves aren’t in the United States or in countries that will easily extradite them. Moreover, companies that are hacked are restrained in their desire for the criminals to be prosecuted because that means their own embarrassing breach will be in the news that much longer. In April 2014, the F.B.I. issued an alert that these sorts of attacks would only increase as providers moved from paper to electronic records.
A recent theft involving Anthem is a perfect illustration. Tens of millions of patient records were compromised, all were stored in a centralized database, none were encrypted, and no one has been caught. Anthem’s response was to send out letters to victims offering free credit monitoring. But credit monitoring isn’t an antidote for a breach of medical records. What good does a form letter do for someone whose most private data has just been stolen?
What’s the solution? For starters, disaggregation, meaning that medical data should be stored in individual or family units rather than in centralized databases. Such a regime would return the data to the person who should own it in the first place: the patient. Each individual or family would have medical data in a personal cloud or a digital wallet. Patients could then share their data how they choose: with family members, with researchers, with other doctors for a second opinion.
We cannot leave it to the health record software companies — the Cerners, Epics and Allscripts of the world — to bring about the needed changes. Their business is to sell proprietary information software to health systems to create large centralized databases for such things as insurance reimbursements and patient care. Their success has relied on an old, paternalistic model in medicine in which the data is generated and owned by doctors and hospitals.
Yes, giving consumers control of their own medical data would revolutionize who owns medical data and how it is used. Concerns about researchers losing access to this amassed data are overstated. Patients have shown an overwhelming willingness to share their information for altruistic reasons (which far exceeds the track record of doctors and health systems when it comes to sharing data).
The private and academic sectors are hard at work on a technology solution: one that is tamper-proof, ensures confidentiality and makes sharing medical data easy. One approach, known as a blockchain, is an encrypted data platform that would give patients digital wallets containing all their medical data, continually updated, that they can share at will.
We need to move on from the days of health systems storing and owning all our health data. Patients should be the owners of their own medical data. It’s an entitlement and civil right that should be recognized.

Michael Meneghini drilled into the knee of his first patient at a hospital here at dawn. Within an hour, the 66-year-old woman had a replacement joint made of titanium and cobalt chrome, and she was sent home the next day.
But the Obama administration was watching over her caregivers’ shoulders. If, over three months, her medical costs exceeded a target amount set by President Obama’s health regulators in Washington, Dr. Meneghini’s employer, Indiana University Health, stood to lose money.
Such efforts to squeeze spending out of the nation’s health system may well remain as Mr. Obama exits the West Wing and Donald J. Trump takes his seat in the Oval Office. The Affordable Care Act is in extreme peril, and Mr. Obama will meet with congressional Democrats at the Capitol on Wednesday to try to devise a strategy that can stave off the quick-strike repeal of the health law that Republicans plan for the opening months of the Trump administration.
But the transformation of American health care that has occurred over the last eight years — touching every aspect of the system, down to a knee replacement in the nation’s heartland — has a momentum that could prove impossible to stop.
Expanding insurance coverage to more than 20 million Americans is among Mr. Obama’s proudest accomplishments, but the changes he has pushed go deeper. They have had an impact on every level of care — from what happens during checkups and surgery to how doctors and hospitals are paid, how their results are measured and how they work together.
“From the moment I first set foot in the Oval Office in February 2009, the president told me that the law can’t be just about covering the uninsured, but that it also has to be about changing the way care is delivered,” said Nancy-Ann DeParle, who as a White House aide helped lead the effort to pass and carry out the health law. His message, she said: “I don’t want to cover everyone and just put them in the same creaky old delivery system.”
Changes in the delivery system already affect far more people than the law’s higher-profile coverage gains. To visit IU Health, the largest health care provider in Indiana, with 15 hospitals and 8,700 doctors, is to see those changes up close. Its leaders have started moving away from fee-for-service medicine, where every procedure, examination and prescription fetches a price. The emphasis now is on preventive care, on taking responsibility for the health of patients not only in the hospital, but also in the community.
Social work has become a larger part of the medical mission. Collaboration between doctors is becoming a necessity.
“I don’t know who could be against it: higher quality and lower cost,” said Ryan C. Kitchell, an executive vice president and the chief administrative officer of IU Health.
And unlike Mr. Obama’s insurance coverage expansions, these changes are not in jeopardy, said Dennis M. Murphy, IU Health’s president and chief executive.
“We’ve got to create more value in health care,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview after Mr. Trump’s election. “That principle, I think, survives.”
During Mr. Obama’s tenure, big systems like IU Health have gobbled up smaller hospitals and physician groups as the industry has consolidated, partly in response to incentives in the Affordable Care Act. Most doctors across the United States are using electronic medical records, installed in many cases with federal money provided by the economic stimulus law of 2009. The federal government and private insurers are rewarding health care providers that work together to coordinate care and avoid unnecessary expenses.
Doctors and hospitals here are obsessed with metrics, not least because under the health law, they may be rewarded or penalized based on their performance. They tally the number of medication errors, the number of patients injured in falls and the number who develop infections after certain types of surgery.
Expanding coverage is seen not as a political issue, but as a clinical and financial imperative. IU Health has more than 150 “navigators” who work with patients to help them get insurance, often through a Medicaid expansion authorized and funded by the health law and engineered here by Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect.
“I’ve been a registered Republican my whole life, but I support the Affordable Care Act,” said Dr. Gregory C. Kiray, co-chief of primary care for IU Health Physicians, “because it allows patients to be taken care of.”
To better understand how Mr. Obama has changed health care, two reporters from The New York Times spent a week shadowing and talking to doctors, patients, executives and others at IU Health, a system that demonstrates the breadth of changes catalyzed by the Affordable Care Act.
To many IU Health employees, the pace of change can be bewildering, the new directives too numerous or burdensome.
“People feel like they are swimming in an ocean, drowning,” said Dr. Meneghini, an orthopedic surgeon at IU Health’s Saxony Hospital here in Fishers, a suburb of Indianapolis.
But the medical profession increasingly understands that painful as it is, the revolution is necessary and unstoppable.
“The national economy cannot sustain health care being as big a share of the gross domestic product as it is,” Mr. Murphy said, uttering what once amounted to heresy for a health care provider.
Fury over the Affordable Care Act helped jump-start the Tea Party movement and sweep Republicans into control of the House of Representatives in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. It ensured gridlock that stifled many of Mr. Obama’s greatest legislative ambitions for six of his eight years in office, and it may well have played a role in the election of Mr. Trump, who attacked the law throughout his campaign.
Yet to Mr. Obama, the law remains one of his greatest achievements, said Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff. It also has been his constant concern.
“This attention to cost and concern about cost, and even the emotional concern about cost, comes up all the time,” Mr. McDonough said.
The Affordable Care Act gave the government sweeping authority to test new models of care, and the administration has aggressively used that power to try different ways of paying for cancer care, heart surgery, primary care and other services covered by Medicare and Medicaid.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who has been the secretary of health and human services since 2014, said she met with Mr. Obama early in her tenure to describe a series of payment and delivery reforms. He was so supportive, she said, that she and her team decided to undertake even more changes.
The size and speed of some of those initiatives have provoked criticism from Republicans, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, picked by Mr. Trump to be the health and human services secretary. They say the efforts threaten the quality of care and exceed the authority of the agency overseeing Medicare by requiring doctors and hospitals to participate.
More than 170 House Republicans signed a recent letter of which Mr. Price was an author, urging the administration to “stop experimenting with Americans’ health.”
But moving aggressively to change how medical care is delivered and paid for has been important to Mr. Obama. In 2015, his administration set a goal for half of all Medicare payments to be tied to the quality, instead of the quantity, of care that doctors and hospitals provide by 2018. Mr. Obama believes that basing pay on whether a doctor visit or a medical procedure helps a patient, rather than on how much care the patient receives, will result in better care.
“What he said was, ‘Be thoughtfully aggressive,’” Ms. Burwell said.
“I started drinking soda again,” confessed Willie Johnson, a 52-year-old patient with uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure.
“How much?” Dr. Michael E. Busha, a primary care physician at IU Health in Indianapolis, asked quietly as he updated Mr. Johnson’s electronic record.
“Quite a bit.”
For Dr. Busha, that mattered.
He helps lead the IU system’s effort to measure how well doctors do at keeping patients healthy. And even this champion of “quality measures” — vital to the Obama administration’s goal of paying doctors based on outcomes, not the amount of care — has found that it is not always easy to meet them.
If enough of his patients fall below the standards set by IU Health, Dr. Busha could lose some of his income. The average salary for the system’s primary care doctors is $236,000. Of that, $50,000 is tied to meeting benchmarks for quality, access (whether a doctor agrees to see patients on weekends and at night, for example) and other performance measures.
Mr. Johnson, who registers patients when they arrive for neurology appointments at IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, was not helping. He also had stopped taking his cholesterol medicine because it left a bad taste in his mouth. And he was using neither the gym membership that IU Health helps pay for nor his sleep apnea machine. “I never could get adjusted to it,” he told the doctor.
Like other primary care doctors at IU Health, Dr. Busha is part of a team that includes a pharmacist, a social worker and a “care manager.” Such teams, encouraged by the health law, focus on patients like Mr. Johnson who are not meeting IU Health’s quality measures, and who are disproportionately likely to end up in the emergency room or be hospitalized.
“The whole paradigm now is to identify your high-risk people and provide more resources to them, provide better care to them, keep them out of the hospital,” said Dr. Kiray, the primary care co-chief.
Partly because of these efforts, IU Health’s two adult hospitals in downtown Indianapolis are already seeing 12 percent fewer inpatients than they were in 2013. The system is merging the two hospitals into a $1 billion medical center focused heavily on outpatient care.
President Obama would be proud. Administration officials have continually emphasized the importance of primary care and the “social determinants” of health. They have offered grants to health care providers to identify Medicaid and Medicare patients with unmet social needs: inadequate food supplies, unpaid rent or utility bills and experience with violence at home, for example.
But with some patients, only so much can be done: Mr. Johnson’s care manager had stopped working with him after deciding he was not ready to make changes.
“Are we ready to try it again?” Dr. Busha asked him.
Mr. Johnson agreed to let the care manager contact him, and to return for a follow-up visit in two months.
Such efforts, said Mr. Murphy, the system’s chief executive, will remain “highly relevant” even if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.
The push toward a “risk-based” model over traditional fee-for-service medicine has spread beyond Medicare and Medicaid to private insurers. And the Obama administration has been testing new ways to save money on all sorts of medical care. Some of the experiments, overseen by an office created under the Affordable Care Act, have shown promise. But evaluating results is difficult.
“It may be good in theory,” Dr. John M. Thomas, a primary care physician at an IU Health practice in Lafayette, said of Dr. Busha’s system of quality measurements. “But there are a lot of flaws.”
For example, he explained, rather than risk being paid less because some patients have uncontrolled diabetes, doctors could tell those patients, “I’m sorry, you’re not in compliance with your medications, and I don’t want to be your physician.”
Dr. Busha said he was used to hearing such arguments.
“I have that conversation on a weekly basis,” he said. “You know: ‘What if my patients don’t believe in immunizations? Why am I held accountable for that?’”
He added, “We kind of tell them, ‘It’s your job to convince them.’”
When IU Health discovered that a knee surgeon was using “bone cement” costing $300 a patient while another achieved the same results for $84, the first doctor was promptly informed. He switched.
IU Health now posts a color-coded “value tracker” in operating rooms that gives a green light to lower-cost surgical products, a red light to high-cost items and a yellow light to those in between.
“A huge cultural shift,” Dr. Anthony T. Sorkin, the medical director of orthopedics, said of the changes in his department — for the surgeons and the patients.
The IU Health system performed 3,900 hip- and knee-replacement operations in the year that ended on June 30. But it is not enough for doctors just to replace a knee or a hip. They are under pressure, from Medicare and private insurers, to manage and coordinate care for their patients before and after surgery. And, they say, payment for their services is continually being squeezed.
Doctors have three main ways to cut costs: improve the condition of patients before surgery, look for savings in every item used in the operating room (gloves, gowns, syringes, surgical tools, sutures, sponges and the implant itself), and send patients to nursing homes that strive to shorten the length of stay.
“I’ve been an orthopedic surgeon for 18 years,” Dr. Sorkin said. “For many of those years, I never once considered the cost for nursing homes.”
Why such attention to cost? In 67 geographic areas, including Indianapolis, Medicare now sets a target price for joint-replacement procedures. That target covers not only doctor services and hospital care but also 90 days of follow-up services like physical therapy, home health care and nursing-home stays. Hospitals are at risk: Medicare can pay bonuses or impose penalties, depending on whether spending targets and quality standards set by the government are met.
“We worry about 90 days of care, 90 days of Medicare spending, not just the brief time a patient spends in the hospital,” Dr. Sorkin said.
The joint-replacement program was one of the main targets of the letter that Mr. Price and other Republicans wrote to the Obama administration in September, complaining that such programs should be tested on a “voluntary, limited-scale basis” with no requirement for doctors to participate.
But in Indianapolis, the results have been promising. By working closely with nursing homes, IU Health halved the length of stay for patients recuperating from surgery, to an average of 12 days from 24 days in early 2016.
Doctors and nurses understand the need for change, but some still have concerns.
“These reforms are all intended to slow down the consumption of health care resources in the United States,” said Dr. Meneghini, who is the director of joint-replacement at Saxony Hospital here in Fishers. “We are careening at a rapid rate to a two-tier system. The public who can’t afford it goes to a public hospital and gets free health care. Those who have money get to pay for really nice care.”
Justin Kloski learned that he qualified for Medicaid under the worst of circumstances. The student and part-time lawn-company worker had lost 20 pounds, could not shake a nagging cough and was sleeping 14 hours a day when he decided to visit a clinic in Muncie, Ind., that provides free care for the poor and uninsured. A clinic employee invited Mr. Kloski, now 28, to apply for Medicaid.
A few days later, he took his new coverage to the emergency room at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie. A CT scan found a 15-centimeter tumor in his chest, so big it was pressing on his windpipe. In May 2015, he learned he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a form of cancer that is curable if caught early.
The Affordable Care Act, and Governor Pence’s decision to go against many other Republican governors and expand Medicaid under the law, may well have saved Mr. Kloski’s life.
He is among more than 400,000 Indiana residents — many of them previously uninsured — who have enrolled in Medicaid since Mr. Pence expanded it in 2015, the 10th Republican governor to do so. Under the terms of the health law, anyone with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or approximately $16,500 a year for an individual, now qualifies in states that opt to expand the program.
IU Health says it receives more Medicaid payments than any other health care provider in the state. Since the expansion began, the percentage of patients with Medicaid has grown to 23.2 from 20.7.
At the same time, the percentage of IU Health patients who are uninsured has fallen to 2.2 from 5.
In 2015 alone, the health system enrolled 14,000 people in Medicaid or private coverage, sometimes even signing up patients as they lay in hospital beds.
“We went all in because it’s a pretty big deal to us,” said Jonathan W. Vanator, IU Health’s vice president for revenue cycle services.
In the first nine months of last year, IU Health officials said, the amount of bad debt owed by patients and referred to collection agencies totaled $233 million, a 23 percent reduction from the comparable period in 2015, thanks largely to Mr. Obama’s health law.
But, the officials added, these gains have been largely offset by cuts in Medicare reimbursements and other federal funds under a law that has given and taken away.
Mr. Murphy is among many hospital executives now anxious about the possibility of seeing a bump in uninsured patients if the health law is repealed, while not getting back the federal funds they gave up under the health law. “I do think it would be problematic if part of the deal was changed and not the whole deal,” he said.
Mr. Pence expanded Medicaid only after the Obama administration agreed to let Indiana do it in its own way: Instead of getting virtually free coverage, as Medicaid recipients in many other states do, people enrolled in Indiana’s expansion pay up to 5 percent of their income toward it. Mr. Trump appears interested in promoting Indiana’s “personal responsibility” model: He has picked its chief architect, Seema Verma, to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Since Mr. Kloski had no income when he enrolled, he paid $1 a month; he has since been classified as “medically frail” and does not have to pay anything.
Medicaid has paid for virtually all of his cancer care, including a one-week hospitalization after the diagnosis, months of chemotherapy, and frequent scans and blood tests.
But Mr. Kloski and his mother, Renee Epperson, are still not fans of the health law over all. They believed that it required that Mr. Kloski be dropped, when he turned 26, from the health plan his mother has through her job at Target — not understanding that it was the law that kept him on the plan until he was 26.
Mr. Kloski paid a penalty for going uninsured in 2014 rather than even explore whether he might qualify for a subsidy and find an affordable private plan through the marketplaces.
“There were so many horror stories about how expensive it was going to be,” Ms. Epperson, 47, recalled. “Justin said, ‘I’m not even going to try it, Mom.’”
And until they were interviewed for this article, the mother and son did not know that the law was responsible for the expansion of Medicaid that Mr. Kloski benefited from. Neither voted in last year’s presidential election; Ms. Epperson said that she disliked both candidates, and that even though Hillary Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act, she found Mrs. Clinton’s positions unacceptable on too many other issues, like abortion rights, to support her.
Still, she said, she ardently hopes that Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress will continue allowing low-income adults like her son to qualify for Medicaid.
“Oh my God, yes,” she said. “Absolutely.”
As for Mr. Murphy, IU Health’s chief executive, he said that while he did not want to think too much about changes that were still hypothetical, the prospect of losing the Medicaid expansion made him anxious.
“I worry about lots of things,” he said. “That list is probably 50 long, and this is definitely on that list.”

The woman’s husband, Jeff Anderson, asked him, “Are you too tired to do this?”
“He looked me straight in the eye — very quiet guy — and said, ‘I was born to do this,’” Mr. Anderson recalled.
The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, the cabinet official who will lead the new administration’s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.
Since then, the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career. He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as heavy-handed government intrusion.
Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta’s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients. But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress, he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies — seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases, for instance, and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.
Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts. Still, his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career.
Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination, and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price’s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights. Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump, who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, for example, and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone.
If confirmed, Mr. Price, 62, will soon have far more power to influence the nation’s vast health care system than he ever did as a lawmaker. One of his first tasks would be to help Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress determine how to eviscerate and replace the health law, a goal he has held since the law’s passage in 2010. But as leader of the agency that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr. Price would also hold considerable regulatory power, with the ability to influence everything from how applications to market new drugs are reviewed to how doctors are compensated for treating elderly and poor patients.
As Mr. Price prepares for two confirmation hearings — the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday — his past efforts on behalf of health-related companies, which have donated generously to his campaigns, are under scrutiny. So, too, is Mr. Price’s history of trading in biomedical, pharmaceutical and health insurance stocks while serving on the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. Democrats have called for investigations into whether he traded stock based on information he gleaned as a congressman.
Last year, Mr. Price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company, Zimmer Biomet, from financial losses due to a new federal regulation. The regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for Medicare patients; Mr. Price’s legislation would have delayed its implementation. After he introduced it, Zimmer’s political action committee contributed to his re-election campaign; the string of events was first reported Monday by CNN.
Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price “had no knowledge or input into the purchase” of the Zimmer stock, which he said was made by a broker. Asked why Mr. Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying health-related stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation, Mr. Blando said, “We know that other members of Congress, including Democrats, have holdings in health care stocks and vote on health-related legislation.”
In a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr. Price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43 health-related and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest. Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an “exhaustive review” of Mr. Price’s financial holdings, Mr. Blando said last week that Mr. Price “takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously.”
Although not among the billionaires whom Mr. Trump has tapped for his cabinet, Mr. Price has profited from medicine, both as a doctor and as an active investor in health care-related companies including Aetna, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Zimmer Biomet, which makes artificial joints and other medical devices. He has an estimated net worth of $13.6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with assets that include real estate. He has also been an effective fund-raiser: Even in his first run for office in 1996, his war chest of $173,000, much of which came from doctors and medical companies, led his poorly financed Democratic opponent to call him “Dr. Dollar.”
A brisk, hyper-focused workaholic who relishes the granular details of legislative proposals and process, Mr. Price expressed concern last year about Mr. Trump’s grasp of the issues. Taking questions from a student group at Emory University, he said he had voted for Marco Rubio in the Republican primary and called Mr. Trump an “empty policy vessel” who was “dangerous for politics and the economy,” according to the student newspaper.
Mr. Price, who declined to be interviewed, was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in 2005. In the Georgia Legislature, he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In Congress, he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health, opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor.
He has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. It would repeal the law’s expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income, with older people getting higher credits.
Mr. Price grew up in Dearborn, Mich., the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice. He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather, who practiced medicine into his 90s. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he moved to Georgia, completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell, a relatively affluent, conservative suburb of Atlanta.
In the 1990s, his practice, Compass Orthopedics, was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics. It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia, and now has 100 doctors and 1,000 employees spread over 21 locations.
Dr. Steven B. Wertheim, another founding partner of Resurgens, said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide M.R.I.s, physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations in-house rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals. More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates.
“His overall gist was, ‘Look, if all we did was practice good medicine, we’d be broke by tomorrow,’” Dr. Wertheim said of Mr. Price. “He understood the need to run a business.”
As a physician, Mr. Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies’ approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy — a common complaint among specialists. Similarly, he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well, like using electronic medical records.
“Those are the things that drove him crazy,” Dr. Wertheim said.
His resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr. Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career, and his work there led him to run for office in 1995, when the House seat in his district opened up. But by 2002, as his legislative duties increased, he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital, a vast, chaotic, aging complex, just a few blocks from the State Capitol.
For the next two years, Mr. Price was the medical director of Grady’s orthopedic clinic, seeing a vastly different population than the well-off, privately insured patients he was used to. Most of Grady’s patients are poor and black, and many lack any form of insurance. Long waits for care are the norm, and trauma, including gunshot wounds, is a big part of the caseload.
“He called me and asked if there was a position,” said Dr. James R. Roberson, the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine, whose residents train at Grady. “He needed some flexibility — that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady, because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career.”
Dr. Roberson said that Mr. Price played a “unique role” at the clinic, training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies — long wait times, for example — and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings. Although he saw patients, he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night — an unusual arrangement, Dr. Roberson said.
In the Legislature, Mr. Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority, although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip.
His fortunes changed in 2003, after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican hands.
As the majority leader, Mr. Price’s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers, gleaned from assiduous research, helped advance his party’s agenda.
In the state Legislature, he was the leader who delivered bad news, the no-nonsense tactician to some of his Southern-born colleagues’ more backslapping style. His sense of humor, when he used it, was dry. Colleagues often wondered if he slept.
“He’s a machine,” said Russell K. Paul, a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr. Price.
During his two years in the majority, Mr. Price’s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed.
“He was very bright, articulate, and smart enough to be able to see the different sides,” said Tom Bordeaux, a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr. Price over a package of bills Mr. Price introduced to limit doctors’ liability in malpractice cases. “But he was just totally unwilling. He was very gracious and he was completely inflexible.”
Ultimately, Mr. Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped pain-and-suffering damages for malpractice victims at $250,000.
Mr. Paul, now the mayor of Sandy Springs, Ga., said Mr. Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature, when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since Reconstruction.
“There was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgia,” Mr. Paul said, “and that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warrior.”
In Congress, Mr. Price has made frequent speeches to health industry and physician groups, and has occasionally introduced legislation on their behalf. Last year, for example, he sponsored a bill fighting new lower Medicare payment rates for “durable medical equipment” like wheelchairs and canes. A few months later, he spoke at a conference for companies that supply such equipment, which held a $100-a-head fund-raiser on his behalf that same day.
Mr. Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare — potentially putting him at odds with his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has pledged not to “touch” the program. Speaking to a student group at the University of Michigan in 2015, Mr. Price expressed concern that Mr. Trump would not listen to others, including Congress, if elected.
“When I hear Trump saying things like, ‘I’ll just do XYZ,’ without seemingly any regard for the legislative branch,” Mr. Price told the group, “it gives me some thought.”

There is just one issue: The public isn’t likely to know much about them.
In a sharp break with the past, the department has stopped publicizing fines against companies. As of Monday, seven weeks after the inauguration of President Trump, the department had yet to post a single news release about an enforcement fine.
By contrast, the Obama administration saw the announcements — essentially publicly shaming companies — as a major tool in its workplace safety enforcement. It issued an average of about 460 news releases annually about fines and other enforcement actions, said Eric Conn, a lawyer in Washington who tracks such cases.
“The reason you do news releases is to influence other employers” to clean up their acts, said David Michaels, who was an administrator of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the agency within the Labor Department that oversees workplace safety, during much of the Obama administration.
As Mr. Trump vows to roll back regulations across the federal government, the early experience in the Labor Department shows that there are many ways to signal the administration’s new direction. Concern among labor unions and advocates of workplace safety is so high that some unions raced to court last month to intervene in a lawsuit seeking to undo a new rule that prevents companies from retaliating against employees who report workplace hazards.
Jillian Rogers, a spokeswoman for the Labor Department, declined to comment when asked why OSHA had not issued any such releases. But she said that the agency’s enforcement efforts were unchanged and that such efforts were “reflected across various media channels,” like newsletters and social media.
“The Department of Labor is continuing to operate business as usual, including enforcement operations,” Ms. Rogers said.
In addition to the rule on worker retaliation, several other OSHA regulations or standards, on issues like record-keeping practices and use of a mineral linked to a deadly lung disease, face delay or elimination.
Last week, the Senate passed a measure to repeal an Obama-era rule that required companies seeking significant federal contracts to disclose violations of labor standards, like safety and fair-pay rules, or instances when they were accused of such violations. The so-called blacklisting rule was intended to prevent companies that violated workplace regulations from getting federal money.
Alan Chvotkin, executive vice president for the Professional Services Council, a trade association that represents federal contractors, hailed the measure, which Mr. Trump may now sign into law. He said the rule was onerous and unfair, because companies had to report unproved accusations.
“The regulatory scheme was overly burdensome,” Mr. Chvotkin said. “We applaud the change.”
As an agency, OSHA has long struggled to have an impact. Its rule-making procedures are arduous, and changes can take years or even decades to enact.
Last year, to help the agency flex its muscles, Congress passed a law doubling the fines companies faced for safety violations. The agency also took aim at certain industries it considered repeat offenders.
Among other things, it levied fines last year as high as $317,000 against several poultry producers like Tyson Foods, Koch Foods and Birdsboro Kosher Farms. It also assessed a $2.5 million fine against Ajin USA, a company in Alabama that supplies auto parts for South Korean carmakers like Kia and Hyundai, after a 20-year-old woman was killed when a factory robot malfunctioned.
Still, the Trump administration and lawmakers seem to be making good on commitments to roll back regulations on businesses, and OSHA appears to be a prime target.
Industry groups are pushing back against an Obama-era regulation meant to exert pressure on companies to better comply with record-keeping rules. A provision of that rule, which was supposed to take effect last month, would require companies to electronically submit accident data to OSHA so the agency could post the information on a public website. As recently as early January, OSHA said on its website that it expected the site to be live in February.
But in recent weeks, the agency changed the wording so that it now states, “OSHA is not accepting electronic submissions at this time.”
“That was not an accident,” said Mr. Conn, the lawyer. “That was a big signal to employers that even if they report the data, it will not be published online.”
Ms. Rogers, the department spokeswoman, did not comment on the wording change.
In addition, OSHA’s ability to charge companies with failures to properly record workplace injuries may be severely curtailed.
For years, the agency had taken the position that it had up to five and a half years after an alleged violation to issue a citation to a company. But a court in 2012 found that OSHA’s interpretation was inconsistent with what the court called the “clear” wording of the law, which gave the agency only six months to bring charges.
In December, the Obama administration issued a rule aimed at circumventing the court decision and restoring the five-and-a-half-year period. But the House recently repealed that rule, and the Senate is expected to follow suit.
Arthur G. Sapper, senior counsel at Ogletree Deakins and the lawyer who successfully argued against the agency in the 2012 court case, said the new OSHA rule deserved repeal.
“They could have gone to that or another court or to Congress, but instead they tried to evade the law by changing their regulations,” Mr. Sapper said.
But Mr. Michaels, the former head of OSHA, said that if the rule died, safety recording would effectively become voluntary because finding violations and bringing charges within six months was nearly impossible.
“Responsible companies will keep good records, but the low-road companies won’t, and that will put responsible companies at a disadvantage,” said Mr. Michaels, an epidemiologist who is now a professor at George Washington University.
In addition, the agency said recently that it was delaying a rule intended to sharply lower occupational exposure to beryllium, a widely used mineral linked to a deadly lung disease. The rule, which was set to go into effect this month, will be delayed until at least May.
The action is the latest twist in a four-decade effort by safety advocates to tighten beryllium exposure limits. Those advocates say they are optimistic that the new exposure standard will go into effect with only minor changes, but they added that any long delays or major revisions could jeopardize worker health.
Michael Wright, director of health, safety and environment for the United Steelworkers, said that if the rule was delayed or overhauled, “then we will have a big problem, and we’ll be fighting that with every resource we have.”
