Rebecca Duncan, Cary, N.C.: John Edwards’s health care proposals sound workable, especially when enhanced by your explanation of their worth. Yet I don’t think any plan will work as long as care providers remain dependent upon expensive diagnostic solutions to explore the simplest of problems and sometimes to cover their own lack of expertise. We may need computer-based diagnostics to maintain our cars, which have grown in complexity over the years. But has the human body changed in ways that dictate a similar reliance on technology? Call it nostalgia, but I think there is room in the medical profession for better low-tech diagnosis of routine symptoms.

Paul Krugman: By all means, let’s try to improve the practice of medicine — better diagnosis, electronic records, and more. But meanwhile, let’s find a better way to pay for it.

Karl Berger, M.D., Johnstown, Pa.: I have been practicing Pediatrics in the U.S. since 1970. I came from Germany, where I received my license to practice medicine in 1968. I was put off then by the two-tier system in Germany of private patients and federally insured patients. You walked into a German doctor’s office and there were two waiting rooms: one, plush with leather chairs and never crowded, and one filled with the huddling masses (if you could see them through the cigarette smoke). But now I say it is time to consider tiered payment systems not unlike it: one tightly controlled by cost effective medications and interventions as established by scientific consensus; the other freewheeling and catering to the taste of those who can pay. It took me 35 years to come to that conclusion.

Paul Krugman: Better a two-tier system in which some people get nicer treatment than others than the two-tier system we have now, in which many people get no treatment at all.

Rolf A. Nesse, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho: I understand that buying insurance is only half the problem. You need to create real improvement in the actual delivery systems of the care. Focusing on only payment schemes is in my view naive. We have a double problem, an upcoming shortage of physicians, especially primary care and a expected surge of aging baby boomers, happening at the same time. Insurance companies do not in any way now actually improve the delivery system except in entities like Kaiser or Group Health Cooperative where, by being true health care delivery companies, they can orchestrate both payment and delivery using unique solutions not available in the conventional fee-for-service model of care. Any proposal not linking finance to delivery reform will be weak.

Paul Krugman: There’s some delivery reform in the Edwards plan; I just didn’t have the space to get into it. And a national insurance system provides the base for reforming delivery, too.

Steve Chan, Los Altos Hills, Calif.: I don’t doubt what you said about the insurance companies’ gaming of the system is true, but I am not convinced that Medicare’s overhead is that low. Hope you got the figures to support that. Besides, it seems that most Medicare patients need a supplementary insurance — the cost, and certainly the overhead, of which is not low.

Take my situation. I am retired and have an employer provided healthcare. As soon as I turned 65, Medicare became the primary, with the employer’s secondary. Yet my premium contribution remained pretty much the same for a much lower coverage because it is now secondary. It covered only the 20 percent that Medicare does not pay, after a host of deductibles and out-of-pockets the difference of which I can barely tell, if at all. Yes, that is not part of Medicare’s overhead but is part of the games insurance company plays. As time goes on, retirees are basically forced to move to H.M.O.’s because they keep increasing the premium as well as the deductibles and out-of-pockets. The only good thing about the retirement healthcare is its drug benefit.

So here is my question. If Medicare is that good, why do people need supplemental? So I suspect if everyone gets a system like Medicare, everyone will have to buy supplementals and will continue to get gamed — let’s be charitable and not use the word rip-off. And instead of hoping that it will or may eventually become a single-payer system, why not go directly to it, like what Canada has?

Paul Krugman: Medicare doesn’t offer complete coverage, which is why many people buy supplementals. But the low overhead is not in question: traditional (non-H.M.O.) Medicare’s administrative costs are around 2 percent of benefits, so 98 percent gets spent on health care, while companies providing individual insurance typically have “medical loss ratios” – the percentage of premiums spent on health care — of only around 80 percent.

Tim Cornillie, Barrington, Ill.: I have a small idea which may help save our healthcare system. You acknowledge the efficiencies of single-payer programs, and yet people are skeptical of systems in which are government-provided.

A possible strategy would be to make health care “single biller.” If all billing was through the government, and then reallocated by them to insurers, it would streamline billing for providers insurers would then have to deal with how care provided matched up to coverage.

Paul Krugman: As I understand the Edwards plan, it does just that: billing would be via the Health Markets.

Sara Pyle, New York: Do you think that, if something like the current Edwards plan were implemented, that physicians would be more eager to accept Medicare — even under another name? At present, many doctors do not accept Medicare, and patients in poor areas tend to go to clinics that are not really the greatest. I have worked in East Harlem for many years and, for the most part, that’s what the families I have known have done and still do.

Paul Krugman: Good question. I don’t know the answer.

Greg Otis, Brooklyn, N.Y.: I’d be interested to hear your comments about the health care plan proposed by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, which requires all Americans to have health insurance, obtained through private insurers or government programs, and, most importantly, removes employers from the health care system. Linking health coverage to one’s job is the most illogical aspect to our current system, and Senator Wyden’s proposal would phase them out over a period of two years. Moreover, his plan provides a similar system for everyone, rather than the patchwork of fixes proposed by Governor Schwarzenegger or the hybrid system proposed by John Edwards. Senator Wyden’s plan seems to have a great deal of logic on its side.

Paul Krugman: Wyden’s plan is similar to Edwards’, but without the requirement of public-private competition. I like the Edwards plan somewhat better for that reason: Wyden is a good guy with a serious plan, but it doesn’t seem to me to be as good at curbing administrative costs.

Dave Jonsson, Seminole, Fla.: I have read that Mr. Edwards has used trusts to avoid payment of the Medicare tax on the bulk of his income. Is this true? If it is, is he still using them? If he is, he would have a problem gaining my support.

Paul Krugman: Oh, come on. I have no idea about his personal finances. But why on earth does it matter? Here’s the thing: we’ve developed this weird notion that a rich man (say, George Bush) whose policies systematically favor the rich is somehow more virtuous than a rich man, like Edwards, who proposes tax increases on the rich to provide health care for working families — because the rich man who favors his own class is somehow more “authentic.” Can I point out how stupid this is? Can I say that by this criterion, F.D.R. — the greatest president in U.S. history — would be condemned as a phony, because he lived well himself even as he was helping poor Americans?

Steve Smith, Dorset, Vt.: Your writing on this topic is cogent and necessary. Today’s column was particularly clear and compelling. I have a question and a comment though. You state that marketing and underwriting processes are used to screen out higher-risk applicants. This is certainly true of underwriting processes, but why of marketing? Since you include marketing expenses in the numerator of the ratio used in this paragraph, this is not a trivial question.

Secondly, you characterize both marketing and underwriting expenses as overhead, which has become for most Americans a pejorative term. Aren’t they in fact operating costs? Overhead refers to expenses that are somewhat inelastic and that are incurred in all companies simply to be in business.

You had a good point but, in my opinion, you twisted facts and words a little to drive it home. You didn’t need to and you’d be among the first to call to account another who did so.

Paul Krugman: I think we’re using the term “overhead” slightly differently. The Edwards people are using it to mean “expenses by insurance companies that aren’t payments to health care providers.” That’s what I mean, too.

And marketing: Health insurers use marketing to try to get more “desirable” clients, that is, people who won’t actually need the insurance. So it’s really part of the same basket as underwriting.

Bart Stuck, Westport, Conn.: Edwards’s proposal for health care reform strikes me as deja vu: many of these ingredients were present in the abortive Clinton administration health care reform effort, no? If not, why not? It seems to be the same, and while the devil is in the details, it does validate that good ideas are hard to kill.

Paul Krugman: The Clinton plan was much harder to explain, but it did have some common elements. Look, there aren’t that many moving pieces in health care; every structure can be described at a broad level in terms of a few major choices.

Matthew Michaels, Cordova, Tenn.: Competition between government and private plans in this system would involve more than the cost of care. Universal coverage would vastly increase the number of persons with access to providers’ offices, giving providers a greater ability to reject those plans offering inadequate compensation for professional services. Lower-reimbursing plans would find themselves with a short provider list and a decreased ability to compete. Just another factor to consider.

Paul Krugman: A complex issue, which I’d need to think about a bit. In practice, universal systems seem to have more, not less, ability to bargain with providers.

Harvard Ayers, Boone, N.C.: I follow your columns closely and appreciate your helping me understand many economic and related issues. Concerning today’s column, you have long said that one of the failures of the U.S. health care system is the legions of insurance industry staff who spend every day trying to find reasons to deny the claims of the insured. I agree. But today, you said that two-thirds of insurance overhead is spent on figuring out who is a high-risk person and then making it tough for them to get coverage. Help me understand this seeming contradiction.

Paul Krugman: Most of the costs are in denying coverage in the first place. Rejecting claims is another big aspect of what the insurance industry does, but I think I’ve always been clear that underwriting is the main source of high administrative costs.

Dennis W. Mack, New York: I have not read Mr. Edwards’s health insurance proposal, but reading between the lines of your commentary, there might be a big issue hiding. Most large employers are self-insured. They hire insurance companies to administer those plans, but the employers set the terms of the coverage. Since working people are generally healthier than people who are not working, the cost of employer-provided health insurance will be significantly lower than community rated insurance. That is clearly the case in New York State, where buying private insurance is considerably more expensive than the cost per employee to employers for the insurance that they provide. As it is, there are many stories of small companies that drop their insurance programs because the child of one employee becomes severely sick and of companies that eliminate coverage for expensive care or care reflecting unpopular lifestyles. Witness the litigation in the 1980’s over whether an employer could drop coverage for anything flowing from H.I.V. infection after one employee came down with AIDS. If Mr. Edwards plan does not do so, we need to bring employer-provided health coverage under the state umbrellas of health insurance and subject to the same coverage requirements and for them to contribute their savings from the community rate to the community pool.

Paul Krugman: Good question, and something to think about. I think the betting is that under any plan of this sort, large companies would probably continue to self-insure, at least for a while, while small companies would put their employees into the pool. Since many small-company employees have no coverage now, that would be major progress."

Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii, who requested the investigation, said it showed that “the Bush administration is not doing enough to protect the privacy of confidential health information.” As a result, Mr. Akaka said, “more and more companies, health care providers and carriers are moving forward with health information technology without the necessary protections.”

In written comments on the report, Jim Nicholson, the secretary of veterans affairs, who supervises one of the nation’s largest health care systems, said, “I concur with the G.A.O. findings.”

But Dr. Robert M. Kolodner, who coordinates work on information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services, disputed the findings. Dr. Kolodner said his department was “very committed to privacy and security as it works toward the president’s goal” of switching medical records from paper to electronic files.

Mark A. Rothstein, the chairman of a panel that advises the government on health information policy, essentially agreed with the accountability office. “Health privacy has not received adequate attention at the Department of Health and Human Services,” said Mr. Rothstein, a professor of law and medical ethics at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. “A sense of urgency is lacking.”

Mr. Rothstein said “time is of the essence” because “the private sector is racing ahead” to establish medical record banks and health information exchanges. In December, he noted, Wal-Mart, Intel and other companies announced they were creating a huge database that could store the personal health records of more than 2.5 million employees and retirees. The companies promised they would have “stringent privacy policies and procedures.”

Mr. Rothstein said Congress should not provide more money for a nationwide health information network unless the administration did more to protect the privacy of electronic medical records.

Dr. William A. Yasnoff, a physician and computer scientist who worked at the Department of Health and Human Services from 2002 to 2005, said he too had found that “the department does not have a comprehensive approach to privacy.”

Explaining why he saw a need for stronger privacy protections in the digital age, Dr. Yasnoff said: “Anything you do to make information more accessible for good, laudable purposes will simultaneously make it more accessible for evil, nefarious purposes. People intuitively understand that, and they are worried.”

The accountability office said doubts about privacy could slow the adoption and use of electronic medical records. Professor Rothstein offered a similar prediction, saying: “If privacy protections are not built into the network, people will not trust it. They won’t participate, or they will opt out if they are allowed to.”

Legislation to encourage the use of health information technology has broad bipartisan support but died in Congress last year, partly because of disagreements over privacy protections.

Under Mr. Bush’s proposal, lawmakers said, it is not clear how much control people would have over their electronic medical records.

Several members of Congress have drafted legislation to clarify consumers’ control over such data. One proposal, by Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, both Republicans, would establish health data banks in which people could store electronic copies of their medical records. Under the bill, a consumer would “maintain ownership over the entire health record” and could control access to it.

By contrast, under existing federal rules, hospitals and other health care providers generally do not have to obtain a patient’s consent to use or disclose information for “treatment, payment or health care operations.”"

Ms. Greiner said that the subcontractor, Health Data Management Services, worked for Magellan, not Empire. “If any contract was breached, we are going to take direct action,” she said.

She said that it was not yet known whether the disc had been lost or stolen. “We are still working with the venders and U.P.S. to find the compact disc,” Ms. Greiner said. “We have no evidence that it was stolen or that members security has been breached.”

The loss, which was first reported to WellPoint’s Empire unit on Feb. 9, was the second breach of security involving WellPoint member information in recent months.

In October, WellPoint learned that electronic backup tapes with information on 196,000 WellPoint members had been stolen from a data processor in Massachusetts operated by Concentra, a national data warehouse company.

Most of the 196,000 people in that case were Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield members in Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Virginia, according to WellPoint. Ms. Greiner said that data on Empire members had not been involved in the October theft, which has not been solved.

After a preliminary investigation to identify the members, Empire began notifying their New York employers last Saturday. Some companies relayed the information to all their employees, because they are not supposed to know who among their workers may be monitored by the behavioral services company.

Empire said that the members who had data on the disc should have received letters by the end of this week. The letters will include information on how to contact Equifax. (Empire members who want to know sooner whether their data was lost can call toll free 1-800-293-3443, between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.)

Magellan, for its part, said it was changing its procedures to eliminate sending information on compact discs by U.P.S., said Erin Somers, a Magellan spokeswoman. The data loss was “the result of an error in judgment on both sides, by Magellan and Health Data Management Solutions,” she said.

But Silicon Valley technology companies that do not have or need retiree coverage are wary of new taxpayer-financed subsidies.

The health care debate is heating up as candidates polish their positions for next year’s presidential primaries, and as Democrats in Congress assert their newfound power.

In general, employers “are more interested in reform today than at any time since the Clinton effort” in the early 1990s, said Robert S. Galvin, global health care and policy director at General Electric, which provides health benefits for 460,000 employees and dependents and 240,000 retirees and dependents.

The surge of interest, Mr. Galvin said, “is driven by compounding health cost increases at three times the general inflation rate, plus the entrance of Wal-Mart and other retailers” that are beginning to feel the pain of out-of-control increases in costs.

Wal-Mart Stores introduced lower-cost coverage for its huge work force last year, after state officials and editorial writers criticized the numbers of Wal-Mart employees on state Medicaid rolls.

Many retailers, with large staffs of low-paid, temporary and part-time workers, would welcome a larger government role.

“The way it’s going, there will be 75 million uninsured in another 10 years,” said James D. Sinegal, chief executive of Costco Wholesale, which subsidizes health care for 81,000 of its 100,000 workers in the United States. “The federal government has to lend some assistance.”

Mr. Sinegal said he had agreed to support an unlikely coalition of businesses and labor unions that recently called for “achieving a new American health care system by 2012.” The group, the Better Health Care Together campaign, includes Wal-Mart, AT&T, Intel and Kelly Services, the temporary-staffing company, as well as the Service Employees International Union and the Communications Workers of America.

“The system is going to break,” warned Carl T. Camden, president and chief executive of Kelly Services. “You can only put so many uninsured people through the emergency rooms before employers stop offering coverage.”

Indeed, a bill proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would scale back the role of employers while requiring individuals and companies to share in the costs. President Bush’s proposal would treat high-cost health care plans paid by employers as wages subject to income tax, and would also offer a new tax deduction to people who buy insurance on their own.

Economists say that employers would raise wages if they did not have to pay for employee health care. The Treasury would stand to gain $140 billion a year in personal income taxes if the benefits were treated as wages, said Len Burman, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. There would be about $70 billion more in additional payroll taxes due on those wages, he said.

But taxes would have to go up to keep the health care system functioning.

Leslie Dach, executive vice president for corporate affairs and government relations at Wal-Mart, said that the company’s “message to elected officials is: ‘The time to act is now.’ ” Mr. Dach, a public relations specialist based in Washington and a frequent adviser to Democratic presidential candidates, joined Wal-Mart last year.

While employers generally agree that steps must be taken to control health care costs, they are divided over whether or not the solutions should come from the government.

“That is the elephant in the room,” said Mr. Galvin of General Electric.

Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of Intel, another participant in the Better Health Care Together campaign, is skeptical about a new government role. He said the private sector could do the best job at improving efficiency in the system.

Corporate purchasers could use their buying power, he said, to insist on technological aids like electronic prescriptions, remote monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses and electronic health records for Americans.

Companies like General Motors argue that government agencies, which spend about half of the $2 trillion in annual health spending, should join with employers in pushing for changes to lower costs.

“Working with the government as a fellow purchaser can accomplish a great deal to help improve our health care system,” said Bruce E. Bradley, director of health care strategy and public policy at G.M., which provides health care for 1.1 million people, including more than 500,000 retirees and their spouses.

Michael J. Critelli, chairman of Pitney Bowes, the business services company, says he backs changes that emphasize preventive medicine. “Any health plan, whether employer, government or private insurance needs to invest its most significant dollars in incentives for people to take good care of themselves,” he said.

He added: “The spiraling cost of health care is a result of an explosive growth in chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and asthma. The health care debate needs to be focused on the core issue: making Americans healthier.”

By providing clinics, exercise and other wellness programs as well as low-cost or free drugs for certain types of patients, he said, annual cost increases for Pitney Bowes employees have fallen into the low single digits over the last 15 years. That is well below the double-digit percentage increases that many companies have experienced.

Neither G.M. nor Wal-Mart favors a government-based central payer system. But older companies and their unions are very interested in Congressional measures that would allow early retirees under age 65 to qualify for Medicare or to buy into the Medicare program, with help from their former employers, said Alan Reuther, legislative director of the United Automobile Workers.

General Motors has far different concerns, of course, than Wal-Mart, a retailer that covers more than one million employees and dependents in the United States but does not provide a retiree health benefit.

Another set of issues divides large companies from small businesses, which employ 50 percent of working Americans. Their owners worry that in some states they may be forced to spend for coverage of young workers with little interest in health coverage.

“The premium keeps going up and, even worse, the insurance companies keep decreasing the benefits,” said Steve Caughran, who owns three small companies in Fresno, Calif. One, a Quiznos fast-food restaurant, has 14 uninsured high school and college students who work part time.

Requiring employers to cover workers who lack health insurance will hardly correct the forces pushing up costs, like expensive new drugs, insurance fraud and inefficient state programs, Mr. Caughran argues.

Mr. Camden of Kelly Services notes that the majority of the 45 million Americans who do not have health insurance have jobs. He argues that many of these workers are essential to keeping the United States economy competitive.

“In the next decade or two, manufacturing is going to steadily decline,” he said. “Employment will come from the entrepreneurial, scientific parts of the economy,” including many who work as independent contractors and temporary employees.

Part of the solution should be to “separate health care from employer sponsorship,” Mr. Camden said. “The employer-provided health care system is just dead, although some people haven’t recognized it as dead yet.”

Similarly, Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, criticizes the current employer-sponsored system as “a relic of the industrial economy.”

Mr. Camden listed possible remedies as an “employment-based” withholding tax, matched by employers as in Social Security, with Medicare and Medicaid expanded to cover the unemployed.

But most big companies are not ready to give up on their health care obligations. “Regardless of who takes the lead, we collectively as a national society have to consolidate around three or four different ideas,” Mr. MacDonald of I.B.M. said.

He called for a national debate on such topics as maintaining existing employer-subsidized health care, with “some level of umbrella coverage over that, some level of a single payer system.”

“A lot of positioning is going on now,” he said. “The reality is that changes are inevitable, I think sooner rather than later.”"

Case, who  plans to unveil RevolutionHealth.com, says the time is ripe for a dominant health care brand.","It is such a potentially big opportunity, in fact, that one of RevolutionHealth.com’s main challenges could be making itself visible in a market increasingly crowded with competitors elbowing for the consumer-patient’s attention.

The biggest in the pack by far is WebMD Health, a stock market favorite of late, which has more than 40 million unique users a month visiting its network of consumer sites, including the flagship, WebMD.com. Other leaders, as measured by Web traffic, include NIH.gov, from the National Institutes of Health; Yahoo Health; Mayoclinic.com; and About.com Health, which is owned by The New York Times Company.

Meanwhile, Google, without announcing any big health effort, has been quietly drawing more health information seekers into its gravitational pull with various new patient-friendly features. By typing a search term like “sore throat,” for example, a Google user is led to relevant information about potential causes and risks, treatments and tests, and alternative medicines.

Google is also reportedly at work on various links to consumer health information that users will be able to personalize to their own specifications.

Mr. Case, though, dismisses search-engine approaches like Google’s as “not particularly helpful.” And while he acknowledges that WebMD “does have a lead and does a good job,” he says he hopes to make RevolutionHealth.com into a site visitors will use frequently “to manage their lives.”

Wes Richel, a health care analyst with the research company Gartner, said that even if Mr. Case could succeed in the health information arena, establishing a new brand would take at least several years. Meanwhile, he said, “Google is a known brand. Mayo is a known brand.”

Mr. Case said he hoped to achieve brand awareness within five years, but he declined to predict when his Web site would become profitable.

Since the test site went up in late January, RevolutionHealth.com has assembled an audience of 486,000 unique visitors in March, according to the research firm comScore Media Metrix.

The revamped version of the site will be aimed primarily at women, who tend to be the bigger portion of the Web health audience.

A Mom Central page is intended for a busy mother who, according to Revolution Health’s executive vice president, Ron Klain, is “trying to juggle her health, her children’s health and perhaps her elderly parents’ health, all at the same time.”

There will also be 1,500 medical conditions that can be sorted by the ailment or treatment, with related comments from experts and from other users of the site. And like other health Web sites, it will provide a directory of doctors by specialty and location, along with short reviews by patients.

There will also be information from the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and Harvard Medical School, which also have their own popular Web sites.

Users will also be able to create their own pages within RevolutionHealth.com for collecting personal and general information, which they can keep private or share as they choose, Mr. Case said.

Parents of autistic children, for example, may decide to gather experiences and knowledge in digital scrapbooks and transfer all or part of the material to public sites.

Like WebMD.com and many insurers, including Aetna, RevolutionHealth.com will also promote personal health records, giving consumers a place to assemble their medical information, prescription records and insurance payment claims, for example.

But Mr. Richel, the Gartner analyst, said there were high barriers to the concept’s catching on.

“One of the most hyped terms in the country is the personal health record,” he said. “Only a tiny fraction, less than 1 percent, of those who have access to their information in all of the health plans together actually look at it.”

The complications, he said, include the technology issues involved in linking such records to the doctors, hospitals and other health care providers that might be in a position to use them to improve a patient’s treatment. And consumers may have trouble compiling the data from various health care providers into a single record, he said.

“The real issue is that the providers don’t want to give up that data,” Mr. Richel said.

RevolutionHealth.com plans to announce several advertisers on Thursday. But Mr. Case said he would be conservative in pursuing and displaying ads, to avoid any perception that a drug manufacturer, for example, might influence the information.

Drug industry money is one of the big lures for the Web health publishers.

Martin J. Wygod, the chairman of WebMD Health, said the pharmaceutical companies were spending about $455 million on marketing to patients and doctors online this year. But that is only about 3.5 percent of the $13 billion the drug industry spends on advertising, he said.

“Our major competition is television,” Mr. Wygod said. But he noted that drug ad spending, online and off, is growing as the drug companies cut costs by using fewer sales representatives who call on doctors.

With advertising as the main revenue model, RevolutionHealth.com is promoting itself as entirely free to users. The site does plan eventually to sell services like helping patients sort out disputes with health insurers, Mr. Case said. But in a departure from an earlier intention to sell such offerings to consumers, Mr. Case now sees employers as the buyers.

A group of private investors who have joined Mr. Case in putting a total of about $130 million into Revolution Health Group are helping bankroll the Web venture. They include some former corporate chief executives who were handsomely rewarded amid corporate controversies on the way to retirement. They include the Revolution Health board members Ms. Fiorina, late of Hewlett-Packard; Franklin D. Raines, the former chief of Fannie Mae; and Stephen F. Wiggins, founder and former chief of Oxford Health Plans.

Perhaps the best-known and least controversial board member is Mr. Powell, the former secretary of state, who spreads the word about Revolution Health in his frequent speaking engagements.

Those big backers, Mr. Case said, will give RevolutionHealth.com its edge.

“We plan to invest significantly,” he said. “We can afford to take the time to build the brand and build the trust.”"

","SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 — Four states have joined forces with Google to make information from their Web sites more directly accessible through Internet searches.

Much of the public data on government Web sites — things like school rankings, contractor and real estate licenses and information on emergency and public health services — is easy to access through the sites themselves, but is not always readily available through Web search engines.

Google has been working with officials in Arizona, California, Utah and Virginia to make some of that information more broadly available, using a technological standard for exposing previously hidden Web pages.

The company said that over time it hoped to extend the partnership to other government agencies at the federal, state and local level. Since the Web standard has recently been recognized by all major search engines, like Yahoo, Microsoft and Ask, the information would also be accessible through those services.

Having electronic medical records is a great idea and would be a step toward simplifying life for all, including the patients.

I have had some health issues lately and have seen quite a few physicians as a result. My doctor's appointment is generally scheduled for at least half an hour before my actual visit with the physician.

This allows time for the ritual of filling out information forms consisting of several pages requesting information -- some of which at my advanced age I have difficulty recalling -- about diseases I hope never to get.

If all this information were available to every hospital and physician, think of all the time we would save, and we could safely forget the date of our appendectomy.

The computerized medical record, with centralized data storage, is a notion kicking around since the 1960s.

It is a na? concept whose time is not likely to come. It would make much more sense to adopt the system employed by the armed services since World War II: the individual's personal medical record travels with him.

Today it could be a memory stick carried by the potential patient. Readable in anybody's computer (with the patient's permission), the stick could carry a mass of information, including immunizations, major medical problems and the actual photos of key X-rays. And have room left over!

As a physician who has had a totally paperless office for 14 years, I can fully corroborate the value of modern information technology in the delivery of medical care.

However inexpensive VistA is, it is emphatically not a simple-to-use system and definitely not intuitive. And given its limitation on the billing and administrative side of the practice -- which for primary care physicians can run to more than half of their revenue -- it is not the answer to the need for modernizing the clinical practice of medicine.

Even if VistA were to become a de facto standard for emergency medical records, its lack of customizability would limit its usefulness.

I recently relocated from New York City to Bellingham, Wash., and in doing so changed my Medicare carrier, necessitating changing dozens of billing codes and rules for the same procedures in order to be reimbursed.

If we only had a single payer system, so that I didn't need a $40,000-per-year employee whose sole job was to get the myriad of insurance companies, each with its own documentation and payment rules, to pay $50 for an office visit.

Given the number of privacy breaches that have occurred from what should have been secure fields such as banking, employment and so on, I see no way I could trust my medical history to any doctor or hospital, using such online approaches to medical information.

I wish this were not true, as I appreciate what the computerized system benefits could be, but I must note that at present any such attempt would be a disaster.

8,207,2007-06-13T00:00:00Z,article,Federal Grant for a Medical Mission Goes Awry,548b48e638f0d8482929ac4e,"organizations:Coast Guard, subject:United States Politics and Government, subject:Ships and Shipping, subject:Law and Legislation",Business,0.0,None,A case of two Coast Guard cutters shows that earmarks to faith-based groups may not achieve their stated purpose.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/business/13cutter.html,1246,A case of two Coast Guard cutters shows that earmarks to faith-based groups may not achieve their stated purpose.,"Canvasback Missions, in Benicia, Calif., took ownership of the cutters, the White Sage and the White Holly, in Baltimore in September 1999. This was the first time such ships had been given away through an earmark, the Coast Guard said.

Pressed for cash, Canvasback sold the White Sage a few months later for about $85,000. Two years later, the struggling mission sold the White Holly to the Bay Area couple for $330,000. The mission did not inform the Coast Guard property office about the sales.

Typically, decommissioned Coast Guard vessels are sold at auction, are included in foreign aid packages or are added to the nation’s mothball fleet.

If the two cutters had been sold at auction, the General Services Administration would have monitored their use for five years. But the Canvasback earmark required no such monitoring, and Coast Guard officials said they did not know about the sales until The New York Times asked about them.

The fate of the White Holly and the White Sage comes as a surprise to people who supported the Canvasback earmark.

Former Representative Frank D. Riggs, Republican of California, whose staff drafted the earmark, said it “would raise concerns” if the ships were “not used as intended.”

Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, was also credited by Canvasback with working on the earmark. But David Snepp, Ms. Snowe’s spokesman, said she had merely voted for it. Mr. Snepp called Canvasback’s actions troubling and said the senator had asked her staff to research what is now a gray area: whether selling the two ships was legal.

“If they were not used in Micronesia, they were definitely not used in the spirit of the way this was written,” Mr. Snepp said. The text of the earmark gave the government the right to reclaim the ships, he added. While that was perhaps unlikely, he continued: “They were supposed to retain the vessels in case the Coast Guard needed them back. The charity does not have the option to sell.”

Photo

A harsher assessment came from Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group that opposes earmarks, and a former Coast Guard officer. “They are flipping the property,” Mr. Ellis said.

Jamie W. Spence, president and founder of Canvasback Missions, said all the sales proceeds supported the organization’s work in the Marshall Islands, where it has provided eye and dental care and counseling on diabetes prevention to thousands of people since it was founded in 1981.

“We did everything in our power to put these ships into service,” Mr. Spence said. But when the group could not raise the money to repair and maintain the vessels, it sold them instead, using the proceeds to cope with its financial difficulties, he said.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Mr. Spence said he had consulted with Canvasback’s legal advisers and was confident the sales were ethical and legal.

Coast Guard officials were surprised at the cutters’ fate. “The White Holly and the White Sage are in the South Pacific,” Lynn Brown, the personal property manager in the decommissioning office, said in March. She affirmed recently that her office had not known that Canvasback sold the ships.

Mr. Spence acknowledged that he did not give notice to Ms. Brown’s office. But he said he told Coast Guard employees in the Bay Area about the White Holly sale and mentioned the White Sage sale to the Coast Guard officer in charge of the Baltimore yard before the deal and to civilian Coast Guard officials afterward. He did not respond to requests to identify those people.

While all earmarks are troublesome to critics like Mr. Ellis, who called the Canvasback gift an “utter indictment of earmarks,” those made for faith-based groups involve special questions about the constitutional borders between church and state.

The Coast Guard ships were given to Canvasback for a secular purpose, providing medical services. But Mr. Spence said Canvasback did not isolate the sales proceeds; instead it mingled them with its general revenues, which also cover activities that include evangelism. And under most court decisions, evangelism cannot be paid for with federal grants.

Mr. Spence said no constitutional violations occurred. “I’m very certain that the proceeds were used for supporting our medical program,” he said, “and I’m absolutely sure they were not used for evangelism.” He said Canvasback, a nondenominational Christian mission, raises donations separately for its evangelism activities, which included donating Bibles translated into local languages and constructing a chapel.

Mr. Spence and his wife, Jacque, established their medical mission 26 years ago, using a 71-foot catamaran, the Canvasback, to navigate the shallow coasts of the poorer, more remote islands of Micronesia. As the ministry grew, it mobilized medical professionals to volunteer for short stints in the islands and delivered donated medical equipment and supplies.

When they sought the Congressional earmark, the Spences were hoping the two cutters would allow them to expand their medical ministry, Mr. Spence said. But the mission acquired and then sold those vessels, and a third vessel that was privately donated, because Canvasback determined that maintaining and operating the ships was too big a financial burden, he explained. But few of these details can be found in the annual statements Canvasback files with the Internal Revenue Service. Two leading nonprofit accounting experts examined the statements and found them to be incomplete and internally inconsistent.

“There is no clear audit trail for the boats,” said Julie L. Floch of Eisner L.L.P. in Manhattan, a member of the I.R.S.’s national advisory panel on nonprofits. Her view was echoed by Jody Blazek of Blazek & Vetterling L.L.P. in Houston, the author of six books on nonprofit tax law and accounting.

William J. MacLean, the accountant in Seaside, Ore., who prepared the filings, declined to comment.

These days, Canvasback has redirected its efforts from ship-based medical care in the remote islands to land-based clinics on the more populated islands, Mr. Spence said.

That work has won praise from health officials in the Marshall Islands — and fresh support from Congress. The tiny mission is now the lead contractor on a diabetes research program being financed through two $1 million Defense Department contracts. Those grants were directed to Canvasback by Congress through a pair of earmarks."

Great article! I am a health care attorney. I've dealt with this issue on both sides. Years ago my grandmother had a major stroke. Doctors at the hospital and subsequently at the nursing home wouldn't tell my mother or me anything! Guess what? She died because of their lack of providing adequate and necessary medical attention. When I attempted to find out the facts- guess what? Nothing. Zero. The hospital, nursing home & HMO all said my mother and I didn't have standing to ask for any information b/c there was no power of attorney placing my mom in charge of receiving that type of information. ARGH!! That's why when I do compliance training at the company I work for, I re-enforce that some issues require a rational judgment call and when in doubt contact the legal department. Because sometimes people can't talk or communicate. Because as a health care company we can verify if our member is in the hospital and is incapable of communication or comprehension. Because if daughter Sally isn't an authorized rep - it doesn't mean mother Mary, who has had a massive heart attack and is heavily sedated, hates daughter Sally. -- A. M. Robles, Esq.

Your numerous tales could win an award for best comedy script from the Pulitzer Jury, if only they weren't so terribly true. How else could we ever understand that old saw, ""We're from the Government, and we're here to help you?"" I don't know what killed the Roman Empire, but I think I know what will kill this one: Bureaucracy! And the death certificate will probably have to be made out in triplicate. I can just imagine some old geezer like me (age 74) calling the local ""Hospital,"" giving my name, and asking if I am still alive. ""We can't give you that information,"" the bureaucrat will say. To which we patients can only reply: ""First do no harm, but, if you do, make sure Hipaa keeps it under everybody's hat."" -- I. N. Kaye

Thank you for the article on ""Keeping Patients' Details Private."" I wonder whether you've looked into the way archives are responding to Hipaa? In 2003 the Society of American Archivists wrote Tommy Thompson to ask for clarification about Hipaa for historical records and researchers (a copy can be found at www.library.ucla.edu/biomed/alhhs/lettertommythompson.html). The letter was never answered and archives around the country are struggling with the issue. In my own state (I am the Archivist of Georgia) it was suggested that 100 year old death records be kept confidential because they contain cause of death which, according to some attorneys, was protected information. -- D. W. Carmicheal.

Thanks so much for your article on Hipaa. As a health care provider, I can relate to your article. I too maintain a level of privacy that approaches secrecy. Here's the context: I'm a doctor at a large multispecialty clinic. When Hipaa ""hit"" we had to attend a mandatory seminar in which we were scared to death! I recall the presenter telling of a four-doctor practice being bankrupted because of simple things like an illegible signature [on an outpatient chart where the treating doctor was obvious]. I also recall the threat of a $10,000 fine and five years in prison per violation. Can you blame us for playing it safe, and revealing nothing? And, once the federal government has you its cross hairs, I expect that none of the experts you cite would step up and help out. Thanks again for the nice article. I hope it causes a change in the Hipaa law. -- D. Neunaber

In January, my brother became a quadriplegic from a stroke. The shock to the family was devastating. A ventilator kept him alive. He died a month after the stroke. He decided to stop the ventilator. We knew this was a possibility and, against all odds, were trying to do whatever we could. The family's treatment at the hospital in Miami was emotional torture. First, there was the illness. Then we dealt with Hipaa, which seemed like it was designed to cause maximum emotional devastation. At first I did not even know what they were talking about. What was Hipaa? I had the unenviable position of being a sister. That really carries no weight. Everyone from the social worker to the duty nurse acted like their first job was not to be sued, and then they paid attention to health care. Like most people, when it was all over, I just wanted to go on with my life. I did not write the letters of complaint that I had composed in my head over and over again. I went home and tried to forget it all. So, thank you again for bringing to light Hipaa's horrible reality. -- L. Mitchell

I expect you're collecting further Hipaa stories: 1. I have a hard time remembering the names of my prescriptions, but Kaiser Permanente pharmacists refused to let me look at my very own screen on their computers, to ask for what has been prescribed to me. (Now I keep a list in my purse for this purpose.) 2. When my aunt's caregiver (Auntie is an alcoholic with dementia) went to the hospital and I was trying to decide what to do about her care I wasn't able to find out WHICH hospital or her prognosis until after her death, some five days later. I had no clue as to seriousness of the problem, and I was trying to cope from 3000 miles away, since I make medical decisions for my aunt. Thought these would add to your list. -- S. G. C.

Since its inception, I have believed Hipaa to be one of the more egregious pieces of legislation our fair Congress has enacted. This paranoid mood has gripped the country for some time, and we are headed toward fascism, in my view. It has even spilled over into education. The community college my son attends, for example, will not release his tuition bill to me, even though I am the one paying it! HIPPA is especially harmful, though, given that so often frail, elderly patients are involved, with no one to speak for them. Thank you for getting the word out there. - Name Withheld

I'd like to bring to your attention another unintended consequence of the law, which detracts from patient care. It can be very difficult for a radiologist to get clinical data and follow-up information about a patient. Examples: 1) Patient is having a M.R.I. at our imaging center. I call for a report on a prior M.R.I., done at another institution. Staff will refuse to fax it over, even though it is important to know what the prior study showed. 2) Patient is having a MRI of the knee at our imaging center. The patient has had arthroscopic surgery on that knee. I call for an operative report. Staff will refuse to fax it over. 3) Patient has a shoulder M.R.I. at our center, and has some unusual findings. The patient has surgery on the shoulder, and I call over for the operative report. By knowing what the intraoperative findings are, I improve as a radiologist, and the next time I see these findings, I will recognize them for what they are. This is one important way doctors improve over time - getting feedback on their performance. Even though I am a consultant to the referring physician, the office staff will refuse to fax me the operative report. It might be interesting to write an article on how Hipaa detracts from patient care, as a patient moves from provider to provider. As a radiologist, I have found the legislation to be nothing but a headache that detracts from my ability to provide the best possible care from my patients. -- V. David

Another misapplication of Hipaa you might want to examine is in how it's implemented regarding college students and health insurance questions. I was forced by the financial offices of a hospital system to have my then-19-year-old daughter telephone them with permission to discuss a pending balance: nothing even related to care or condition. This was even though she is still being covered as a dependent under family medical insurance and we as parents are still paying the bills. From what I've seen of Hipaa, it's a perfect example of the law of unintended consequences. Perhaps a good idea to start with, but with the devil in the details. Hipaa is an important issue that touches many lives daily. Keep up the good work in exposing its problems. -- L.P. Stewart

I read with interest your article on the inappropriate and ridiculous application of Hipaa, having had both of my parents hospitalized for lengthy periods within the past three years and having a mother with ongoing health issues. My dad spent several months in and out of the ICU at in Manhasset, Long Island. The dry erase board on which the patients' assigned nurses were listed was by room number, to ""protect privacy,"" yet the patient names were on the doors to the rooms and doctors regularly discussed patient conditions with family in both the ICU and the ICU waiting room, with other people milling about. I more than once heard a physician tell a family that their relative basically had no hope of survival and a ""decision"" would have to be made. And they couldn't list the patient names on a dry erase board due to privacy concerns? Give me a break. - Name Withheld

Excellent article on the problems with Hipaa. I'm a healthcare reporter and the misapplication of the law is irritating in that sphere. But it was downright maddening when I was restricted from information by some nurses when my grandmother lay dying in the hospital and no other family members were around to attend to her. I loved the last two grafs of your story: ""A hospital spokeswoman, Elena Mesa, was asked if nurses were following Hipaa protocol when they denied adult children information about their parents. She could not answer the question, Ms. Mesa said, because Hipaa prevented her from such discussions with the press."" Touche. -- N. Legue

Re: Hipaa, I have had nothing but problems with getting basic information about basic things like ""is my 96-year-old father there?"" I ask for him in his room at St. Mary's in Santa Maria, Calif. (I'm in Georgia) and I get a nurse on the 4th or 5th ring who will not tell me if he is there. -- B. Ginn

Your article stated, ""the only cases investigated...were complaints filed by patients who were denied access to their own information, the one unambigous violation of the law."" As the former Chief Privacy Officer for a large health care organization, I have networked with many privacy officers from across the nation. I can affirmatively tell you that HHS has investigated health care providers for a variety of other issues. Examples include: not speaking quietly enough in a clinic lobby, making a clerical error by not updating the guarantor when a child reached the age of majority (resulting in the bill being sent to the parent), disclosing information to a young adult's mother without consent, and leaving a message on a patient's answering machine. While I agree that some health care providers have over-applied Hipaa regulations, your article seems to indicate that health care providers have no reason to fear. That's simply not the case. - N. Vogt

A few years ago, our younger daughter became psychotic and was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. She has a genetic condition (VCFS) that makes her prone to psychosis. When she began to recover from that bout, with her full consent and participation, we obtained guardianship. She wanted us to be able to participate in her health care (as well as manage her finances). Her group home obtained a case manager, and the case manager's agency provided a psychotherapist. After several sessions, things our daughter told us made it clear that the therapist had no clue what she was dealing with--this was not ""just"" a psychotic kid whose medicines had controlled her symptoms to some degree. This was a kid whose genetic disorder was like a kind of brain damage. Two or three times, when our daughter had new symptoms popping up, I called the therapist and left messages on her voice mail. I was not trying to find out personal details about whatever our daughter was telling her in therapy sessions. I was trying to GIVE her information. I reminded her that I am the guardian. I faxed her the guardianship papers. The therapist called me twice, telling me that HIPAA rules forbade her to *listen* to my messages. She said she'd be deleting them without listening to them from now on. I encouraged our daughter to keep seeing her, figuring this was at least one more way to help her structure her time (weekly visits she had to try to keep in mind and get to). After several months, the case manager (who hadn't helped with this problem) called a family meeting. The therapist needed to tell us all that she was discontinuing therapy, because nothing she told our daughter seemed to ""stick"" for longer than the duration of each session. Surprise! I told her (though in a nicer way). This is just exactly the sort of thing I was trying to explain to you in those voice mails! -- (Name withheld)

To be perfectly honest, the only way things are going to change with regard to Hipaa's ""unintended conseqences"" with regard to how medical professionals now misinterpret the statute is for the law to be repealed by Congress. I really do not think that anything short of that would bring communications back to some kind of normalcy. And we know that will never happen.

Excellent article on Hipaa. I have had just these kind of cases: child of an elderly and sick parent cannot act as proxy for the parent because of ""privacy concerns.""

''Keeping Patients' Details Private, Even From Kin'' (news article, July 3) was important because it targeted the pitfalls in the federal law intended to protect confidential medical information.

As a geriatric care manager, I am confronted with the downside of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act on a routine basis.

Many adult children whose parents named them as health care proxies and gave them powers of attorney are shocked to learn that in a medical crisis providers refuse to offer medical information.

The confusion, frustration and unnecessary red tape adding to the burden imposed on professionals and advocates to provide care for vulnerable individuals is a continuing challenge.

The bizarre hodgepodge of regulations that were layered into the law have made health providers nervous about fines and jail terms, and in many cases, they have gone overboard misinterpreting the law.

All Americans welcome the respect for their privacy in medical matters, but not to their detriment.

To the Editor:

I believe, from personal experience, that details of a patient's illness should be kept private from kin if the patient is conscious and does not want certain details revealed.

Two years ago, I drove myself to a hospital emergency room with only moderate pain in my right and left shoulder. Since I am over 70, I was immediately given nitroglycerine, and the dose was repeated three times during my emergency room stay.

I was brought two more times to the emergency room, each time with more severe pains. I was then correctly diagnosed with pericarditis. The last hospital wanted to admit me, but I signed myself out against doctor's advice.

When my daughter called at my request, the doctor told her I might die unless I stayed at the hospital. I needed my daughter's involvement, since I could not drive myself to see my doctor, but I did not want to scare her, as she was the mother of a toddler and pregnant with her second child.

I told my doctor that I did not want anyone telling my family that I might die. I was told that my only choice was to prohibit the doctor from giving any information to my family or having no control over what was said.

I am now enjoying excellent health. I put a letter in my file instructing the doctor to share all dire warnings only with me.

The United States ranks dead last on almost all measures of equity because we have the greatest disparity in the quality of care given to richer and poorer citizens. Americans with below-average incomes are much less likely than their counterparts in other industrialized nations to see a doctor when sick, to fill prescriptions or to get needed tests and follow-up care.

Healthy lives. We have known for years that America has a high infant mortality rate, so it is no surprise that we rank last among 23 nations by that yardstick. But the problem is much broader. We rank near the bottom in healthy life expectancy at age 60, and 15th among 19 countries in deaths from a wide range of illnesses that would not have been fatal if treated with timely and effective care. The good news is that we have done a better job than other industrialized nations in reducing smoking. The bad news is that our obesity epidemic is the worst in the world.

Quality. In a comparison with five other countries, the Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States first in providing the “right care” for a given condition as defined by standard clinical guidelines and gave it especially high marks for preventive care, like Pap smears and mammograms to detect early-stage cancers, and blood tests and cholesterol checks for hypertensive patients. But we scored poorly in coordinating the care of chronically ill patients, in protecting the safety of patients, and in meeting their needs and preferences, which drove our overall quality rating down to last place. American doctors and hospitals kill patients through surgical and medical mistakes more often than their counterparts in other industrialized nations.

Life and death. In a comparison of five countries, the United States had the best survival rate for breast cancer, second best for cervical cancer and childhood leukemia, worst for kidney transplants, and almost-worst for liver transplants and colorectal cancer. In an eight-country comparison, the United States ranked last in years of potential life lost to circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes and had the second highest death rate from bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. Although several factors can affect these results, it seems likely that the quality of care delivered was a significant contributor.

Patient satisfaction. Despite the declarations of their political leaders, many Americans hold surprisingly negative views of their health care system. Polls in Europe and North America seven to nine years ago found that only 40 percent of Americans were satisfied with the nation’s health care system, placing us 14th out of 17 countries. In recent Commonwealth Fund surveys of five countries, American attitudes stand out as the most negative, with a third of the adults surveyed calling for rebuilding the entire system, compared with only 13 percent who feel that way in Britain and 14 percent in Canada.

That may be because Americans face higher out-of-pocket costs than citizens elsewhere, are less apt to have a long-term doctor, less able to see a doctor on the same day when sick, and less apt to get their questions answered or receive clear instructions from a doctor. On the other hand, Gallup polls in recent years have shown that three-quarters of the respondents in the United States, in Canada and in Britain rate their personal care as excellent or good, so it could be hard to motivate these people for the wholesale change sought by the disaffected.

Use of information technology. Shockingly, despite our vaunted prowess in computers, software and the Internet, much of our health care system is still operating in the dark ages of paper records and handwritten scrawls. American primary care doctors lag years behind doctors in other advanced nations in adopting electronic medical records or prescribing medications electronically. This makes it harder to coordinate care, spot errors and adhere to standard clinical guidelines.

Top-of-the-line care. Despite our poor showing in many international comparisons, it is doubtful that many Americans, faced with a life-threatening illness, would rather be treated elsewhere. We tend to think that our very best medical centers are the best in the world. But whether this is a realistic assessment or merely a cultural preference for the home team is difficult to say. Only when better measures of clinical excellence are developed will discerning medical shoppers know for sure who is the best of the best.

With health care emerging as a major issue in the presidential campaign and in Congress, it will be important to get beyond empty boasts that this country has “the best health care system in the world” and turn instead to fixing its very real defects. The main goal should be to reduce the huge number of uninsured, who are a major reason for our poor standing globally. But there is also plenty of room to improve our coordination of care, our use of computerized records, communications between doctors and patients, and dozens of other factors that impair the quality of care. The world’s most powerful economy should be able to provide a health care system that really is the best."

But the companies see the potential in attracting a large audience for health-related advertising and services. And both companies bring formidable advantages to the consumer market for such technology.

Microsoft’s software animates more than 90 percent of all personal computers, while Google is the default starting point for most health searches. And people are increasingly turning to their computers and the Web for health information and advice. A Harris poll, published last month, found that 52 percent of adults sometimes or frequently go to the Web for health information, up from 29 percent in 2001.

If the efforts of the two big companies gain momentum over time, that promises to accelerate a shift in power to consumers in health care, just as Internet technology has done in other industries.

Today, about 20 percent of the nation’s patient population have computerized records — rather than paper ones — and the Bush administration has pushed the health care industry to speed up the switch to electronic formats. But these records still tend to be controlled by doctors, hospitals or insurers. A patient moves to another state, for example, but the record usually stays.

The Google and Microsoft initiatives would give much more control to individuals, a trend many health experts see as inevitable. “Patients will ultimately be the stewards of their own information,” said John D. Halamka, a doctor and the chief information officer of the Harvard Medical School.

Already the Web is allowing people to take a more activist approach to health. According to the Harris survey, 58 percent of people who look online for health information discussed what they found with their doctors in the last year.

It is common these days, Dr. Halamka said, for a patient to come in carrying a pile of Web page printouts. “The doctor is becoming a knowledge navigator,” he said. “In the future, health care will be a much more collaborative process between patients and doctors.”

Microsoft and Google are hoping this will lead people to seek more control over their own health records, using tools the companies will provide. Neither company will discuss their plans in detail. But Microsoft’s consumer-oriented effort is scheduled to be announced this fall, while Google’s has been delayed and will probably not be introduced until next year, according to people who have been briefed on the companies’ plans.

A prototype of Google Health, which the company has shown to health professionals and advisers, makes the consumer focus clear. The welcome page reads, “At Google, we feel patients should be in charge of their health information, and they should be able to grant their health care providers, family members, or whomever they choose, access to this information. Google Health was developed to meet this need.”

A presentation of screen images from the prototype — which two people who received it showed to a reporter — then has 17 other Web pages including a “health profile” for medications, conditions and allergies; a personalized “health guide” for suggested treatments, drug interactions and diet and exercise regimens; pages for receiving reminder messages to get prescription refills or visit a doctor; and directories of nearby doctors.

Google executives would not comment on the prototype, other than to say the company plans to experiment and see what people want. “We’ll make mistakes and it will be a long-range march,” said Adam Bosworth, a vice president of engineering and leader of the health team. “But it’s also true that some of what we’re doing is expensive, and for Google it’s not.”

At Microsoft, the long-term goal is similarly ambitious. “It will take grand scale to solve these problems like the data storage, software and networking needed to handle vast amounts of personal health and medical information,” said Steve Shihadeh, general manager of Microsoft’s health solutions group. “So there are not many companies that can do this.”

This year, Microsoft bought a start-up, Medstory, whose search software is tailored for health information, and last year bought a company that makes software for retrieving and displaying patient information in hospitals. Microsoft software is already used in hospitals, clinical laboratories and doctors’ offices, and, Mr. Shihadeh noted, the three most popular health record systems in doctors’ offices are built with Microsoft software and programming tools.

Microsoft will not disclose its product plans, but according to people working with the company the consumer effort will include online offerings as well as software to find, retrieve and store personal health information on personal computers, cellphones and other kinds of digital devices — perhaps even a wristwatch with wireless Internet links some day.

Mr. Shihadeh declined to discuss specifics, but said, “We’re building a broad consumer health platform, and we view this challenge as far bigger than a personal health record, which is just scratching the surface.”

Yet personal health records promise to be a thorny challenge for practical and privacy reasons. To be most useful, a consumer-controlled record would include medical and treatment records from doctors, hospitals, insurers and laboratories. Under federal law, people can request and receive their personal health data within 90 days. But the process is complicated, and the replies typically come on paper, as photocopies or faxes.

The efficient way would be for that data to be sent over the Internet into a person’s digital health record. But that would require partnerships and trust between health care providers and insurers and the digital record-keepers.

Privacy concerns are another big obstacle, as both companies acknowledge. Most likely, they say, trust will build slowly, and the online records will include as much or as little personal information as users are comfortable divulging.

A person might start, for example, by typing in age, gender and a condition, like diabetes, as a way to find more personalized health information. If a person creates a personal health record and later has second thoughts, a simple mouse click should erase it. The promise, the companies say, will be complete consumer control.

There are plenty of competitors these days in online health records and information from start-ups like Revolution Health, headed by AOL’s founder, Stephen M. Case, and thriving profit-makers led by WebMD.

Potential rivals are not underestimating the two technology giants. But the smaller companies have the advantage of being focused entirely on health, and some have been around for years. WebMD, for example, traces its lineage to Healtheon, a fallen star of the dot-com era, founded by the Netscape billionaire Jim Clark.

Google and Microsoft are great companies, said Wayne T. Gattinella, WebMD’s chief executive, but “that doesn’t mean they will be expert in a specific area like health.”

Specialized health search engines — notably Healthline — are gaining ground and adding partners. AOL recently began using Healthline for searches on its health pages, even though Google is a close partner.

Still, 58 percent of people seeking health information online begin with a general search engine, according to a recent Jupiter Research report, and Google dominates the field. “Google is the entry point for most health search, and that is a huge advantage,” said Monique Levy, a Jupiter analyst.

Indeed, it is the market reach and deep pockets that Google and Microsoft can bring to consumer health information that intrigues medical experts, and has lured recruits. Dr. Roni Zeiger, a graduate of Stanford’s School of Medicine, a medical informatics researcher and a former primary care doctor, joined Google last year. The 36-year-old, who still sees patients some evenings and weekends at a nearby clinic, said, “At Google, I can use my expertise and knowledge to potentially help millions of people each day.”"

Its privacy controls, the company said, are set entirely by the individual, including what information goes in and who gets to see it. The HealthVault searches are conducted anonymously, Microsoft said, and will not be linked to any personal information in a HealthVault personal health record.

Microsoft does not expect most individuals to type in much of their own health information into the Web-based record. Instead, the company hopes that individuals will give doctors, clinics and hospitals permission to directly send into their HealthVault record information like medicines prescribed or, say, test results showing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Such data transfers, Mr. Neupert said, would then be automatic, over the Internet, which is why the partnerships are so important. “The issues are: can we get the connections and demonstrate the value of this to people so they build up these records as they go along,” he said.

At NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, Aurelia Boyer, the chief information officer, explained that the hospital was committed to doing whatever it can to help patients manage their own health care. After an initial discussion with Microsoft, the hospital has pledged to start a pilot project to enable some kinds of patient data — EKGs, perhaps — to be automatically sent to a person’s HealthVault account.

If a patient chooses to have a Microsoft personal health record, Ms. Boyer said, “we want to support them.”

The data exchange, she added, will require some software tweaking by the hospital’s technical staff. ""We’ll pilot a few things and see how it goes,"" Ms. Boyer said.

The Microsoft entry comes at a time when people are increasingly using online tools, especially Internet search, to find health information. An aging population with more health concerns, as well as tighter curbs on medical spending, are expected to prompt consumers to take a larger role in managing their own care, using online tools that include personal health records. But that trend has not gone very far yet.

Microsoft is also moving ahead at a time when other large technology companies have seen senior executives in their health units depart or hit bumps in their efforts to push health initiatives.

The leader of Google’s health group, Adam Bosworth, left last month, for example. The company has been developing offerings broadly similar to Microsoft’s — personal health records stored in Google data centers, and enhanced health search.

Google will not discuss the timing of its health plans. Marissa Mayer, the Google vice president now overseeing the health team, said, “We hope the products we’re working on will give people access to better information about health that is more relevant to them and help them manage and control their own information.”

At Cisco, the head of its health care practice, Dr. Jeffrey Rideout, recently left to join a private equity firm, Ziegler HealthVest Management. (Cisco called his departure a “leave of absence.”) And Dossia, a coalition led by Intel to provide employees at several large companies with personal health records, is going more slowly than planned.

But while some other technology companies are pulling back or slowing down in health, “Microsoft is stepping forward and finally declaring the hand it will play,” observed Dr. David J. Brailer, the former health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration, who now heads a firm that invests in medical ventures, Health Evolution Partners.

At the American Heart Association, Dr. Daniel Jones, the president, said that working with Microsoft was a way to accelerate his group’s efforts to curb heart disease. The company is collaborating with the heart association on an online blood pressure management tool online. Heart patients will be able to go to the association’s Web site, open a HealthVault account and include their blood-pressure readings, weight and medications.

At first, Dr. Jones said, they would probably enter the data themselves, but later have it sent from a doctor’s office or laboratory. Ideally, he said, the person would share the information with their doctor or nurse, who could call or send an e-mail message to warn of any disturbing changes. “The potential here is very great,” Dr. Jones said. “And we all recognize the power of Microsoft to reach millions of households.”

Microsoft also has signed up health care companies. Johnson & Johnson LifeScan, the nation’s largest producer of glucose monitors for diabetes patients, plans to enable the monitors’ readouts to be placed into a Microsoft HealthVault account. “We see this as a potentially powerful tool in helping patients manage their diabetes,” said Tom West, president of Johnson & Johnson LifeScan.

Privacy is a huge issue and one likely to slow the spread of personal health records. But Microsoft’s privacy principles have impressed Dr. Deborah Peel, chairwoman of the Patient Privacy Rights Foundation, a nonprofit group. In terms of patient control, and agreeing to outside audits, “Microsoft is setting an industry standard for privacy,” said Dr. Peel.

Mr. Neupert of Microsoft said the key to allaying privacy worries would be a track record of trust and showing consumers the value and convenience of personal health records. Consumers, he noted, initially were reluctant to try online banking because of privacy worries. But today, online banking is mainstream.

Yet none of the users flocking to these services seem perturbed that they have relinquished personal control over this data to companies that, even with the best of intentions, may not be able to keep it safe.

The incidence of data theft — from wallets to data breaches, computer viruses or Dumpster diving — is soaring. This year alone, the security of nearly 77 million Americans’ records has been breached, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego, nearly a fourfold increase over 2006.

Governments around the world are passing and enforcing laws that increasingly hold businesses financially accountable for avoidable data losses. Just last month, the TJX Companies, which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other retail stores, made a settlement offer, subject to court approval, to victims of a huge data breach, in which 45.7 million customers’ credit- and debit-card data was exposed to identity thieves.

As a result, some security experts are starting to ask whether the “identity data-for-services” business model, which is the engine for virtually all e-commerce companies, is a fair trade — not just for consumers, but for business as well.

In response, they are coming up with new protocols and frameworks for collecting, using and governing identity data. Given that virtually all businesses today collect and use these kinds of data, they aim to shift the status quo in ways that could help companies both improve their reputations with customers and avoid the mounting legal liabilities that now face companies that lose control of customer data.

“The myth is that companies have to know all this information about you in order to do business with you,” said Drummond Reed, vice president for infrastructure at Parity Communications, an identity technology company in Needham, Mass. “But from a liability perspective, the less I know about my customers the better.”

Parity is sponsoring a number of open software projects to shift more control to the users whose identity data is at risk. One of the most intriguing is called the CloudTripper Project, which is developing a way for individuals to “take their data with them” as they traverse the Web, just as they keep their wallets and checkbooks with them as they move around in the real world.

Another project, the Identity Governance Framework, aims to help organizations comply with national and international regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It establishes a new approach for securely sharing and auditing sensitive personal information, and has been widely embraced by major enterprise software vendors as well as providers of identity technology. While such projects are helping to close security gaps that should have been addressed long ago, at least one security expert says that such efforts are trying in vain to solve a social problem with technology.

“We’re in a situation where business holds all the cards,” said Mike Neuenschwander, vice president and research director of identity and privacy strategies at the Burton Group, a technology research and advisory service based in Midvale, Utah. “Businesses put the deal in front of the consumer, they control the playing field and the consumer doesn’t have any say in how the deal plays out.”

ONE way to change this, he said, is to make people more like organizations.

To this end, Mr. Neuenschwander and his colleagues have floated the intriguing concept of the L.L.P.: the Limited Liability Persona. This persona would be a legally recognized virtual person in which users could “invest” the financial or identity resources of their choosing.

Once their individual personas are created, consumers would be able to use them as their legal “alter ego,” even in financial transactions. “My L.L.P. would have its own mailing address, its own tax ID number, and that’s the information I’d give when I’m online,” Mr. Neuenschwander said. Other benefits include the ability for “personas” to limit their financial exposure in ways that individuals cannot.

“When you enter into a relationship with a company and give them your personal information, you’re at tremendous risk — and they aren’t,” he said.

“In the U.S., certain kinds of personal information aren’t treated like property at all. It’s very difficult to sue someone for misuse of personal information. And even if you do, they can never give you back your mailing address, your Social Security number or your DNA, for that matter.”

But if a company loses or tampers with an L.L.P’s data, “the law allows me to sue them because it’s corporate information,” Mr. Neuenschwander said. “It’s digital-rights management,” he added, referring to the access control technologies used by publishers and other copyright holders to limit use of digital media, “only you’re acting on behalf of your own organization.”

Mr. Reed of Parity agreed. “Companies use digital-rights management technology to protect their data from us,” he said. “But they’d be better off if we used it to protect our data from them.”"

And that will make them hard to interpret. If prostate cancer rates fall is that because V.A. patients were excluded, for example?

“Cancer research will be severely impacted,” said Dr. Brenda K. Edwards, associate director of the cancer institute’s surveillance research program.

Dr. Edwards added that the situation was so complicated that investigators could not even find a good way to estimate what the new rates would have been if the veterans’ data had been provided.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also relies on data from the state registries. Christie R. Eheman, acting chief for the C.D.C.’s cancer surveillance branch, says she has been talking to V.A. administrators, trying to resolve the situation.

“I think we’ve got some hard work to do,” Dr. Eheman said.

But the veterans agency says there is a limit to how much it can compromise.

“The V.A. has come down clearly,” Dr. Kupersmith said. “The paramount issue for us is the protection of patient privacy and the protection of patient information.”

He added that the department was especially sensitive to privacy concerns in light of incidents like the theft by teenagers last year of a laptop computer containing personal information on 26.5 million veterans.

The impasse over the cancer data began innocuously enough in California, in October 2005, with a routine request. The state’s central cancer registry needed to renew its agreement with V.A. hospitals in the state, as is required every three years.

But this time, the veterans agency had some questions. When California sent in its renewal materials it made clear that the state had provided V.A. data to qualified outside scientists.

But who, the agency asked, was getting that medical and personal information? And what were they doing with it?

There was no way to reply, said Dr. Dee West, the chief scientific officer for the Northern California Cancer Center, one of several surveillance centers in the state. The data go to many researchers and the veterans’ data are mingled with those from all the other hospitals. It would be impossible to sort everything out.

And the agency’s requests came out of nowhere, said William E. Wright, who was chief of the California cancer registry. The V.A. had been providing its patient data since 1972 without incident.

Finally, after a barrage of e-mail messages between Dr. Wright and the V.A., the state asked Veterans Affairs to clarify its position. The department replied with a directive on Aug. 22 that applied to every veterans hospital. And the agency told its hospitals to stop providing information on cancer patients unless and until the states signed its new directive.

Among other things, it says that anyone who wants to use personal data involving Veterans Affairs patients must either get permission from the V.A.’s under secretary of health or find an agency researcher to collaborate with and get permission from the hospital’s ethics board. The directive also says that patient information must be encoded so that unauthorized people cannot read it.

Cancer researchers say they have no idea how they will meet the conditions, said Tina Clarke, an epidemiologist at the Northern California Cancer Center.

For example, Dr. Clarke said, it is not so easy to find a V.A. researcher to collaborate with.

“It means the V.A. collaborator has to have time and has to want to work with you on your research question,” she said.

As for the ethics board, Dr. Clarke said it could take a year or more to get the required permissions from a local board, the registry’s board and, now, the V.A.’s board. Any time a board wants a change that the others did not approve, the proposal would have to go back to the others.

“Privacy concerns are serious,” Dr. Clarke said. “But at the same time, this is a baby with the bath water problem.”

The directive leaves states with three options: do not sign, sign and use the data for research under the V.A.’s conditions, or sign and use data only to compile numbers of cancers. Investigators do not need patient names or other identifying patient information to simply count how many cancers were reported.

With the third option, however, research is limited. For example, finding death rates requires following cancer patients. That means knowing their identities. So do investigations of questions like whether people who lived near a chemical dump were developing cancers. Investigators would need the names and addresses of cancer patients in the area, including V.A. patients.

V.A. administrators say they understand the difficulties but have to protect patients.

“We serve mostly an older population,” said Raye-Anne Dorn, the department’s national coordinator for cancer programs. Many, she said, do not want to be contacted by researchers.

In fact, Ms. Dorn said she felt that way herself. “I’m a vet and I’m also a cancer survivor,” she said. “I wouldn’t take kindly to getting a call from researchers.”

Senator Daniel K. Akaka, the Hawaii Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs oversight committee, expressed sympathy for the V.A.’s position.

Researchers, Mr. Akaka said, “need to try to see what they can do about working with the system and the process.”

Now, states are asking: Is it better to go along with the V.A. and get the data, even if the restrictions make it almost impossible to use the patient information in research? Or is it better to hold firm and not sign?

New Jersey decided to sign, said Dr. Eddy A. Bresnitz, the state epidemiologist. “We don’t have a choice,” Dr. Bresnitz said. “What are we going to do? At the end of the day we want the data.”

Yet the situation, with some states signing and others holding firm, creates a new problem, Dr. Bresnitz said. How can anyone accurately compare cancer rates among states?

In the meantime, V.A. patients will be missing from the latest cancer reports, creating gaps in the cancer record, researchers say. These patients constitute 4 percent of the cancer patients in California, or about 3,000 cases, said Dr. Dennis Deapen, director of the Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program.

California has not signed the directive, and its centers have not been getting data in the two years since the impasse began.

It is especially difficult now to compile national statistics, said Dr. Edwards of the cancer institute. In some states, V.A. hospitals reported data until last month. In others, limited amounts are being reported, and in still other states, no data have been reported for a year or more.

Dr. Edwards is working with other statisticians to see if she can estimate of how many cases are going to be missing in this year’s cancer report.

But, she said, “it’s not clear how that accurate that estimate is going to be.”"

Yesterday, Medtronic and several of its outside consultants said that the company’s decision to halt the device’s use was a close call, because the available data about its failure rate was not overwhelming.

“We decided that the right thing to do for patients was a conservative one,” said Rob Clark, a company spokesman.

Medtronic paid a price in the stock market yesterday, as its shares fell more than 11 percent on news of the safety warning and after the company said it expected the problem to reduce sales in the current quarter by up to a quarter of a billion dollars.

Meanwhile, an inevitable wave of personal injury lawsuits began yesterday, including one filed in federal court in Minneapolis, where Medtronic is based.

The problem that Medtronic disclosed is a tendency for cracks to form in the wire, which either blocks or distorts its electrical flow. The flaws may result in faulty signals being sent to a defibrillator, causing it to unnecessarily shock the heart or, in rare instances, to fail to deliver a life-saving jolt when needed.

Several medical experts said they suspected that the device’s problems might reflect the fact that the Fidelis is the thinnest lead made by Medtronic. In recent years, both Medtronic and a smaller competitor, St. Jude Medical, have introduced smaller-diameter leads because some doctors prefer them, in part because they are easier to thread through a patient’s blood vessels.

Guidant, now owned by Boston Scientific, continues to use a thicker lead.

Some cardiologists said yesterday that they believed the new thinner leads might not be durable enough to survive either the pressure of implantation or the stresses exerted on them once they are in the body.

Dr. Ranjit Suri, a cardiologist at New York Hospital in Queens, said he and his colleagues had stopped using all small-diameter leads, including the Sprint Fidelis, because of problems with them.

“We need to make sure the downsizing of leads doesn’t come at a price,” Dr. Suri said.

In a telephone conference yesterday with analysts, Dr. David Steinhaus, a top medical officer at Medtronic, described the lead fractures as “classic fatigue failures,” a term that typically describes a weakening of metal exposed to repeated stress. He said the company had extensively tested the product before putting it on the market.

In a statement yesterday, St. Jude Medical said it had not experienced any problems like those seen in the Sprint Fidelis product. “There are significant design differences among leads produced by different manufacturers,” St. Jude said.

According to F.D.A. records, one patient death that Medtronic has said may be linked to the lead occurred in August 2006. In the incident, which happened outside the United States, the patient began to receive inappropriate shocks and subsequently developed various heart problems and died, according to that record, a report from a hospital whose location was not contained in the report.

Two other patient deaths occurred this year, one in January and the other in March, according to F.D.A. records. In the January episode, the defibrillator failed to deliver life-saving therapy when needed, apparently because of a problem with the lead, F.D.A. records indicate.

The patient who died in March, who is described in an F.D.A. report as collapsing while “playing,” also received inappropriate shocks. Mr. Clark, the Medtronic spokesman, declined to specify the patient’s age.

He added that two additional deaths — raising the known total to five — had occurred since March and that Medtronic would soon report details of them to the F.D.A.

While several experts agreed that Medtronic acted appropriately to recall the lead, the company’s decision to do so may have been delayed because of a problem that affects the entire heart-device industry: a dearth of data about the performance of defibrillator leads.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Among the three big producers — Medtronic, St. Jude and Boston Scientific — Medtronic has traditionally provided the most data to doctors about lead performance, several experts said. But even that amount is scant, those experts agreed.

Medtronic has long run a postmarketing study of how its leads are performing in patients, but the number of patients in that study is relatively small. Only about 650 patients in it have Sprint Fidelis leads.

“The limitation is that the number is not sufficiently large to accurately capture rare events,” said Dr. Charles Swerdlow, a cardiologist in Los Angeles who is also a consultant to Medtronic.

That problem apparently caught up to Medtronic this year around the time that a Minneapolis cardiologist, Dr. Robert G. Hauser, told the company that he believed there had been a troubling number of incidents in which defibrillators equipped with the Sprint Fidelis leads were firing inappropriately in patients.

In March, the company looked at the experience of patients in its study but realized that the number might too small to draw a conclusion, said Mr. Clark, the Medtronic spokesman. However, the company did send out a letter to doctors informing them that they were looking into the issue.

Medtronic’s subsequent review, among other things, examined data from a larger group, 25,000 patients who are participating in a program in which the company remotely monitors their heart health and can also check on how the defibrillators are performing.

The company found the same rate of problems in that group as in the smaller study, but given the larger number of patients, the company concluded the numbers were more meaningful.

For some patients, that conclusion did not come soon enough. Stephanie Martinson, 35, a speech pathologist in Palo Alto, Calif., said that in March she had a Fidelis lead removed, after she was shocked 26 times in an hour. But in May, two months after Medtronic had notified doctors, the replacement she received was another Fidelis lead.

“There are so many things my doctors and Medtronic didn’t tell me,” she said."

As a first principle, all citizens should provide as they can for their own medical care so they do not impose their own requirements on others. As such, we should mandate that all Americans pay in advance for coverage of catastrophic medical needs.

The two organizing principles would be that the costs of catastrophic care would be spread across the population through insurance, and that while the high costs of serious medical problems would be covered, there would still be large deductibles for most Americans for initial care. (These could be paid out of pocket, or consumers could take out supplemental insurance to cover them.)

Obviously, for those people with little or no income or wealth, society as a whole would have to provide first-dollar coverage. It is only fair that those with more financial means share the burden.

This gives rise to many complex issues. At what income level should people be required to shoulder some and then all of their own insurance needs? Should there be one insurance pool for the entire population or should there be subnational pools? (I would lean toward a single national pool.) Should people be assessed extra premiums related to age or chronic conditions or drug or alcohol addiction? The answers are not obvious, but they are questions Congress and the presidential candidates are refusing to wrestle with.

There are several advantages to a system along these lines that go beyond simply providing care to all. First, since most Americans would have a significant personal cost until the catastrophic coverage took over, they would, at least in theory, shop for the best product. This would be a welcome change from the current system, in which there is virtually no cost and quality transparency. This new system could also lead us toward creating a framework for continuous learning by doctors and hospitals. No other sector of our society does such a bad job of learning from things gone wrong. A major reason for this is that the fear of malpractice suits leads doctors and hospitals to withhold information on bad incidents.

If, instead, the government required providers to report every error within 24 hours, the quality of care would rise considerably. In return, rather than having malpractice cases go to the civil courts, we could establish an independent body to determine the economic damage to the injured party and pay it from the general Treasury revenues. For this to work, the medical societies would need to finally step up to their responsibility and weed out incompetent providers.

The collection of data on medical errors could also be part of a broader effort to create a common national standard for individual medical records. Given the digitalization of the rest of our lives, it is absurd that lives are lost because hospitals can’t immediately call up a patient’s entire medical history on the Internet.

In the end, we cannot look at insurance coverage, medical costs, quality of care and information technology as separate issues. As we strive to make sure every American can get necessary treatment, we must look at every aspect of our health care system. We can do much better, and we should start now."

But unknown to most people is the fact that Ellis Island contains a long-forgotten 22-building hospital complex, which during its busiest years, from 1902 to 1930, was one of the largest public health undertakings in United States history, and a place of heartbreak and hope, sickness and recovery.

Since 1998, Lorie Conway, a Boston-based journalist and documentary filmmaker, has worked to uncover the hospital’s history. She received exclusive access from the National Park Service to film at the abandoned hospital for two years.

She stepped into buildings overgrown with ivy and filled with asbestos and broken glass. She traveled across the country to find records in dusty government archives. She tracked down descendants of long-dead immigrants, here and abroad.

The fruits of her nine-year effort are a book and documentary (and accompanying Web site) titled “Forgotten Ellis Island.” The film had its premiere on Monday at Ellis Island.

On Thursday evening, Ms. Conway screened excerpts from the documentary before a crowd of 40 people at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. She was joined by Alan M. Kraut, a historian at American University.

Ruth J. Abram, the founder of the museum, introduced the presentation by noting the ambivalent attitude toward immigrants that Americans have long held.

“At the same time we needed them, we feared them and their strange languages and customs,” she said. “We did not yet have the knowledge to cure them of tuberculosis or trachoma or cholera, or to stem the spread of disease, whether imported or homegrown. And so we moved to contain them at Ellis Island, thus instituting one of the most extensive public health operations the world had ever seen.”

Ms. Conway made her film on a fairly slim budget, consisting mostly of three grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, totaling $540,000.

Save Ellis Island, a nonprofit group that is trying to raise money to reopen some of the 29 abandoned buildings at Ellis Island, including the hospital complex, hopes Ms. Conway’s film will aid the effort. Claudia B. Ocello, the group’s associate director for education and public programs, said the group had so far raised enough money to stabilize all 29 buildings and reopen one of them, the Ferry Building, which opened in April and contains an exhibition about immigration and public health on Ellis Island. Ms. Ocello said the group aimed to open an Ellis Island Institute in the long abandoned buildings.

Ms. Conway said the inspiration for her project was “The Other Ellis Island,” a 1998 article by Clyde Haberman in The New York Times Magazine that discussed the decrepit condition of the 29 buildings, which were cited by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of America’s most endangered places.

Ms. Conway showed about 36 minutes from the roughly hourlong film. The film is replete with historic photographs, interviews with scholars and immigrants and their family members, and haunting vistas of ghostlike hospital wards. The hospital was built on rock and dirt excavated from the construction of the city’s subway system.

The film points out that medical inspections were directed at those immigrants who traveled in second or third class and that for wealthier immigrants, entry into America – and citizenship — was nearly automatic.

Those less fortunate had to submit to physical inspections that required stripping off all of one’s clothing – an entirely foreign concept, particularly to many immigrant women. Some immigrants had no idea what X-ray machines did; others were fearful that their clothing – or the money sewn inside its seams – would be stolen.

Immigration inspectors and officers from the United States Public Health Service conducted the reviews. A chalk mark – given to about one in five immigrants – meant separation from family, an involuntary hospital stay and, possibly, deportation. Fathers were separated from their wives and children, and a single sick child could require everyone – parents and siblings – to return home.

In 1914, the hospital, by then fully operational, treated 10,000 patients from 75 countries. Feelings of isolation and abandonment, particularly among children, were common.

In the documentary, John Gauqer, who emigrated from France in 1929, at age 5, recalls that he only spoke French when he arrived at Ellis Island. He was held at observation.

“They took me away from my mother,” Mr. Gauqer, now 83, recalled, his English without even the faintest trace of an accent. “I didn’t know what was happening, she didn’t know what was happening, and I was here in this place away from her, never knowing if I was going to see her again.” (He ultimately recovered and was allowed to enter the country.)

Anne Rierson, who emigrated from Sweden in 1925, recalled worrying that her parents had gone on without her. Elizabeth Martin, who arrived from Hungary in 1920, remembered kind nurses who tried to comfort the children, touching their cheeks and holding their hands.

The hospital school taught personal hygiene and the three R’s to the children, not to mention neatness and good manners.

The hospital’s autopsy amphitheater contained a well-known eight-cadaver refrigerator and became a renowned teaching hall, with medical observers from Bellevue and other teaching hospitals in attendance.

Ms. Conway found that hundreds of thousands of patient records had essentially disappeared; she hopes that her film will turn up new clues as to where they have been moved.

Over years of research, Ms. Conway said, she was able to find only one complete patient record — that of Ormond J. McDermott, an Australian who was not trying to immigrate, but merely visit to New York, in 1921. He accidentally left his passport on a ship, and was detained at Ellis Island while the authorities investigated his claims to be a sales apprentice, rather than a contract laborer. While on Ellis Island, he developed scarlet fever; he died. Mr. McDermott’s file ended up at the State Department after his father, part of an influential Australian family, filed a complaint and asked for an investigation.

Ellis Island, including the hospital, faded from use after the United States adopted tight immigration restrictions in 1921 and 1924, with nativists alarmed at the influx of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe.

Ms. Conway’s film explores a particularly ugly side of Ellis Island’s public health history: the influence of now-discredited eugenic beliefs. Doctors would use metal calipers to measure the circumference of immigrants’ heads, believing that ethnicity and race were expressed in physical variation among people.

On the film, an immigrant named Leah Shain remembers an aunt, Pearl, who was detained at Ellis Island for being mentally ill — the family maintains she was not. Pearl was deported back to Europe and later died in the Holocaust. Fiorella H. La Guardia, who worked as a translator at Ellis Island, wrote that many of the immigrants classified as mental cases “were so classified because of ignorance” — the ignorance of both the immigrants and the so-called medical experts.

Despite that sad history, in any year, only 3 percent of immigrants were deported: fewer than 1 percent for contagious diseases and about 2 percent for other causes. But because they knew of someone who had sent back — or knew someone who knew someone who had been sent back — the prospect terrified immigrants.

Ms. Conway and Dr. Kraut both view the Ellis Island hospital as a relative public health success. No major epidemic was ever traced to an immigrant who entered America after being treated at the hospital. Nine of 10 patients treated at the hospital were cured and allowed to enter the country and begin the road to citizenship.

The hospital, in decline since the 1920s, was finally abandoned in 1954. Ms. Conway said the Coast Guard, its last tenant, did not even bother to close the doors and windows, leaving behind everything from muffin tins and soup tureens to clothing trunks and window shades.

Ms. Conway noted that the authorities could simply have erected cinder block quarantine facilities, instead of a state-of-the-art hospital. “Statistically, it was a great success, the line of first defense against these contagious diseases that were unattenuated — we did not have antibiotics,” Ms. Conway said during the question-and-answer session. “It is remarkable to me that the mortality rate was as low as it was.”

Dr. Kraut said the Ellis Island health effort was arguably the biggest federal bureaucratic endeavor since the Civil War. “The fact that it was done with enormous compassion is an extraordinary tale,” he said, describing the quality of care over all as “quite extraordinary.” The germ theory of disease had been developed only fairly recently — in the late 19th century — but antibiotics were not yet available.

Ms. Conway noted that most of her filming was done by 9/11. Parks officials repeatedly reminded her afterward that her virtually unfettered access to the abandoned hospital would have been unthinkable after the terror attacks.

Ms. Conway has sent the final cut of her film to PBS, and she hopes it will be broadcast on public television. She is also looking to screen the film at festivals and possibly theaters."

Can you summarize the new approach to health care at Wal-Mart?

A. The discussion we’re having internally is how you view benefits as an investment. And that’s saying if you look at an associate [Wal-Mart’s term for its employees], a total associate, and you say, if they are healthy they’ll do a better job at work, they’ll be more productive, they’ll be happier, nicer to our customers, we will have less absenteeism, our turnover will be better. All of those things have a benefit, a return to the company. So we’re really saying, instead of just trying to manage a benefit cost, we’re looking really at returns and saying we think we can impact all these other things.

Q. Before making changes this year, you surveyed workers extensively about what they want in a health care plan. What did they say?

A. They said, we want to be able to select what’s right for us. We don’t want you to — because where we were headed in the past was really to simplify, thinking it was too complicated. And what they said was, no, I don’t want you to decide; I want to have the choice and you give me, you know, help me understand what they mean so I can choose. And I want to make sure that I have that emergency everyday health care covered.

Q. What is your goal with the new plans?

A. My goal is to not move everybody to Wal-Mart’s health care plan. It’s to make sure everybody has health care that needs it. And to make sure if somebody’s choosing not to, that there’s — we can try to eliminate the reasons for them not to come onto our plan.

Q. Would you like the number of uninsured workers at Wal-Mart to hit zero? Would you like to see it 5 percent? What is a reasonable goal?

A. Obviously I’d like to see it zero. Do I think we’ll get there? No. There’s still a group of people who don’t think they need coverage. And even at $5 a month, they aren’t going to pay for it.

Q. The average Wal-Mart worker earns less than $20,000 a year, making the company’s health insurance difficult to afford. What do employees say about that?

A. That was part of the open enrollment question — if you’re eligible and you didn’t take Wal-Mart coverage, why? Is it because you have another source of health care or is it because I can’t afford it? Or I believe I can’t afford it. And that 10 percent [who are uninsured] were just about evenly split between, I think I can’t afford it, and I think I don’t need it.

Q. So affordability is not the major big issue that comes up in company surveys?

A. No.

Q. When you think about solving the American health care crisis what are the roles of an employer like Wal-Mart, the government and the individual worker?

A. Clearly, we need to do something differently. And I don’t believe it’s going to end up being voluntary and actually work.

In an ideal world, that would happen, but I don’t know that we can get there. We believe there is always a role for the employer, as well as the individual and the government. So it’s shared responsibility.

The question is — and that’s why I say I think everything has to be examined — is when you look at employer-based health care, I don’t know if it’s the right answer or not, but I think we need to look at it just because it happened by accident.

It wasn’t really well thought out. We’re the only country that does this. And when 40 percent of the employers can’t participate or don’t participate, maybe there’s something that’s wrong with it. But it doesn’t mean if it’s not employer-based, it doesn’t mean employers don’t contribute.

Q. What changes are required?

A. What we have constructed today almost forces the behavior that’s happening. We have a system that pays for activity, not for outcome. So a doctor loses it if he doesn’t order things to be done. And until we figure out how to structure that differently, the doctors, for the most part, don’t like it either. It drives them to — they would rather be managing somebody’s health than ordering tests. But that’s where they’re driven.

My fear is, by the way, is right now that we’re going to focus on solving the uninsured and we won’t solve the core issue, which is we’ve got to figure out the right way, the right reimbursement model that’s really focused on health and not activity. And we’ve got to figure out efficiencies.

Q. What about the role of technology in managing patient health care records?

A. I mean the lack of the technology was astounding to me. I mean absolutely astounding. And when you’ve been doing this as long as I have, it’s the stuff that already exists that’s easy to install — none of it exists in health care. I mean I always tell people our hourly associate in the store has better tools available to them on the floor than a physician has when he sees you to help you treat an illness. And that’s frightening.

Q. On a personal note, what was your reaction when Lee Scott asked you to run health care at Wal-Mart?

A. Given my background, this really was — it wasn’t like I had this career plan and said I hope they give me risk management and health care, of which I know nothing about ... Lee, who just kind of — always comes to the heart of things — the first time I met with him after this, looked at me in the eye and said: “This is a big job. And we need you to go make a difference in health care.”"

It demands a solution, but finding one will not be easy or palatable.","This is mostly because we pay hospitals and doctors more than most other countries do. We rely more on costly specialists, who overuse advanced technologies, like CT scans and M.R.I. machines, and who resort to costly surgical or medical procedures a lot more than doctors in other countries do. Perverse insurance incentives entice doctors and patients to use expensive medical services more than is warranted. And our fragmented array of insurers and providers eats up a lot of money in administrative costs, marketing expenses and profits that do not afflict government-run systems abroad.

Does It Matter? If citizens of an extremely wealthy nation like the United States want to spend more on health care and less on a third car, a new computer or a vacation home, what’s wrong with that? By some measures, Americans are getting good value. Studies by reputable economists have concluded that spending on such advanced treatments as cardiac drugs, devices and surgery; neonatal care for low-birth-weight infants; and mental health drugs have more than paid for themselves by extending lives and improving their quality.

But if health care spending continues on its same trajectory, the United States will reach the point — probably several decades from now — where every penny of the annual increase in gross domestic product would have to go for health care. There would be less and less money for other things, like education, environmental protection, scientific research and national security, that may be equally or more important to the well-being of society.

Governmental budgets will face the crisis even sooner. States are already complaining that they have to crimp other vital activities, like education, to meet soaring Medicaid costs. And federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is surging upward at rates that will cause the deficit to soar. That means politicians will have to raise taxes, severely cut a wide range of other governmental programs, or chop back the health programs themselves.

The question is: What can be done to lower both the high level of health care spending and its high rate of increase from year to year?

The Solutions

Geography. Pioneering studies by researchers at Dartmouth have shown enormous disparities in expenditures on health care from one region to another with no discernible difference in health outcomes. Doctors in high-cost areas use hospitals, costly technology and platoons of consulting physicians a lot more often than doctors in low-cost areas, yet their patients, on average, fare no better. There are hints that they may even do worse because they pick up infections in the hospital and because having a horde of doctors can mean no one is in charge.

If the entire nation could bring its costs down to match the lower-spending regions, the country could cut perhaps 20 to 30 percent off its health care bill, a tremendous saving. That would require changing the long- ingrained practices of the medical profession. Public and private insurers might need to refuse coverage for high-cost care that adds little value.

Stick to What Works. The sad truth is that less than half of all medical care in the United States is supported by good evidence that it works, according to estimates cited by the Congressional Budget Office. If doctors had better information on which treatments work best for which patients, and whether the benefits were commensurate with the costs, needless treatment could be junked, the savings could be substantial, and patient care would surely improve. It could take a decade, or several, to conduct comparative-effectiveness studies, modify relevant laws, and change doctors’ behavior.

Managed Care. For a brief period in the 1990s it looked as if health maintenance organizations competing for patients and carefully managing their care might bring down costs and improve quality at the same time. The H.M.O.’s did help restrain costs for a few years. The problem was, doctors and patients hated the system, management became much looser, and the upsurge in costs resumed. Managed care techniques are creeping back into some health plans, especially for services apt to be overused, but too heavy a hand would most likely produce another backlash.

Information Technologies. The American health care system lags well behind other sectors of the economy — and behind foreign medical systems — in adopting computers, electronic health records and information-sharing technologies that can greatly boost productivity. There is little doubt that widespread computerization could greatly reduce the paperwork burden on doctors and hospitals, head off medication errors, and reduce the costly repetition of diagnostic tests as patients move from one doctor to another. Without an infusion of capital, the transition from paper records is not apt to happen very quickly.

Prevention. Everyone seems to be hoping that preventive medicine — like weight control, exercise, better nutrition, smoking cessation, regular checkups, aggressive screening and judicious use of drugs to reduce risks — will not only improve health but also lower costs in the long run. Preventive medicine actually costs money — somebody has to spend time counseling patients and screening them for disease — and it is not clear how soon, or even whether, substantial savings will show up. Still, the effort has to be made. The Milken Institute recently estimated that the most common chronic diseases cost the economy more than $1 trillion annually, mostly from lost worker productivity, which could balloon to nearly $6 trillion by the middle of the century.

Disease Management. Virtually all policy experts want more careful coordination of the care of chronically ill patients, who account for the largest portion of the nation’s health care expenditures. Although that should improve the quality of the care they get, coordination may not cut costs as substantially as people expect. In some initial trials it has cut costs, in others not.

Drug Prices. Compared with the residents of other countries, Americans pay much more for brand-name prescription drugs, less for generic and over-the-counter drugs, and roughly the same prices for biologics. This page believes it would be beneficial to allow Medicare to negotiate with manufacturers for lower prescription drug prices and to allow cheaper drugs to be imported from abroad. The prospect for big savings is dubious.

Who Picks Up the Tab?

Pay Providers Less. With doctors dreadfully unhappy under the heavy hand of insurers, it would seem shortsighted to make them even unhappier by cutting their compensation to levels paid in other countries. But many experts believe it should be possible to tap into the vast flow of money sluicing through hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities to find savings.

Emphasize Primary Care. In a health system as uncoordinated as ours, many experts believe we could get better health results, possibly for less cost, if we changed reimbursement formulas and medical education programs to reward and produce more primary care doctors and fewer specialists inclined to proliferate high-cost services. It would be a long-term project.

Skin in the Game. The solution favored by many conservatives is to force consumers to shell out more money when they seek medical care so that they will think harder about whether it is really necessary. The “consumer-directed health care” movement calls for providing people with enough information about doctors and treatments so that they can make wise decisions.

There would most likely be some savings. A classic experiment by Rand researchers from 1974 to 1982 found that people who had to pay almost all of their own medical bills spent 30 percent less on health care than those whose insurance covered all their costs, with little or no difference in health outcomes. The one exception was low-income people in poor health, who went without care they needed. Any cost-sharing scheme would have to protect those unable to bear the burden.

And consumer-driven plans have limitations. Most health care spending is racked up by a small percentage of individuals whose bills are so high they are no longer subject to cost sharing; they will hardly be deterred from expensive care they desperately need. Moreover, few consumers have the competence or knowledge to second-guess a doctor’s recommendations.

Single Payer. Deep in their hearts, many liberals yearn for a single-payer system, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, that would have the federal government pay for all care and dictate prices. Such a system would let the government offset the price-setting strength of the medical and pharmaceutical industries, eliminate much of the waste due to a multiplicity of private insurance plans, and greatly cut administrative costs.

But a single-payer system is no panacea for the cost problem — witness Medicare’s own cost troubles — and the approach has limited political support. Private insurers could presumably eliminate some of the waste through uniform billing and payment procedures.

•

By now it should be clear that there is no silver bullet to restrain soaring health care costs. A wide range of contributing factors needs to be tackled simultaneously, with no guarantee they will have a substantial impact any time soon. In many cases we do not have enough solid information to know how to cut costs without impairing quality. So we need to get cracking on a range of solutions. The cascade of knowledge flowing from the human genome project, new nanotechnologies and the advent of treatments tailor-made for individual patients may well accelerate, not mitigate, the rise in medical spending. If we want the benefits, we will need to make them affordable."

Murder and medical practice are simply incompatible.,"Most medical institutions do not want murderers in their midst.

How many patients would go to a hospital where a doctor was a convicted murderer?

How many doctors and nurses would feel comfortable on the same team as a murderer, particularly a perpetrator of a hate crime against one’s own group?

The Swedish case is extraordinary, of course. But it poses questions that resonate far beyond the prestigious Karolinska Institute, where the murderer, Karl Helge Hampus Svensson, 31, began medical school last year. (Last week, he was expelled on a technical issue — apparently falsifying his high school transcript.)

Alliances like the European Union have made it easier for doctors licensed in one country to practice in another. This increases the pressure on medical schools to be ever more vigilant in asking applicants about past criminal activity.

Potential terrorists, for example, might find a medical license useful. In the Middle East, doctors have been leaders of terrorist groups, and just last July, British officials implicated four doctors and three other medical workers in botched terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow.

Mr. Svensson (he had legally changed his surname from Hellekant while in prison) was convicted in the 1999 hate murder of a trade union worker and was paroled after serving six and a half years of an 11-year sentence. The Karolinska learned of his identity through two anonymous tips last fall. Although many Swedish news organizations reported the story at the time, most adhered to local journalistic custom and did not name him.

In scores of interviews, Swedes tended to express the view that a convicted criminal who wanted to go to medical school deserved the opportunity.

But their opinions changed when they were informed that the Karolinska student was the publicized 1999 murderer. Although a few of those interviewed said they might go to such a doctor depending on circumstances, none said they would send a loved one.

Swedish law prohibits public universities like the Karolinska from asking about an applicant’s criminal past. But taxi companies and other private concerns are allowed to demand such information before hiring an individual.

What makes murder a special problem for medicine is the lengthy, costly and complex education system.

Consider the application process, which can vary among medical schools, even in the same country.

The Karolinska does not require letters of recommendation, as is usually standard in the United States. About one-third of the Karolinska students are admitted on the basis of grades without an interview. The other two-thirds are judged on grades and an interview with senior faculty members. Applicants choose whether they want to be interviewed, and Mr. Svensson was one of them.

Two faculty members, one a psychiatrist, interviewed Mr. Svensson separately. But neither asked for an explanation of the six-and-a-half-year period in his life, when he took courses through a prison-based intranet system. He did not volunteer his prison record. Karolinska faculty interviewers are not required to keep notes of those encounters.

No one knows how many Swedish doctors have criminal records, in part because of Swedish laws and culture that emphasize personal integrity. When Mr. Svensson’s classmates were asked at a student meeting how many had criminal records, nine other men and women said they did, according to an article in the medical student union’s publication, Medicor. No definition of what constituted a crime was given.

In the United States, the chances of a convicted criminal’s being admitted to medical school were reduced in 2002, when the standard application form from the Association of American Medical Colleges began requiring answers to questions about military discharge history, arrests and felony convictions.

Eight of the 126 medical schools in the United States do not participate in the association’s application service but may solicit the background information on their own. Six of the eight are in Texas. The 118 others may choose to receive only some of the solicited information, depending on state laws and institutional policies on privacy rights.

Each school determines which offenses, if any, would disqualify an individual for admission.

The association also recommends that all medical schools conduct criminal background checks for all matriculating students. But it is not clear how many do. From 2002 to 2006, on average, 26 of 36,000 applicants a year said yes to a felony.

Dr. Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, the Karolinska’s president, has asked the institute’s ethics committee to address a number of questions concerning long-range policy on the issue of admitting criminals to the medical school.

Among the questions: Must educators and administrators inform patients about a convicted criminal student’s past? If so, when and how? What about a convicted murderer who was later involved in treating a patient who died under medical care? Even if he was innocent in that death, the suspicions would be hard to erase.

Before Mr. Svensson was expelled, the Swedish medical licensing agency said that even if he graduated it would not permit him to practice. Sweden does not give medical licenses valid for only certain categories, like research.

As the Karolinska Institute struggled with the legal, administrative and ethical quandaries in the Svensson case, Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson was asked whether she would go to a doctor who had murdered. She would not say. But never, she added in one of a series of interviews in her office, would she send her children to such a doctor.

Speaking of the general problems in admitting a murderer to medical school, Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson said: “In the final analysis, it comes down to trust, because when you are a patient you are putting your life in someone else’s hands.”

Last week, she said that because Mr. Svensson’s expulsion was based on a technicality, his case did not resolve the broad issue of who is fit to be a doctor and whether a murderer forfeits the right to become one. That, she repeated, is up to Swedish legislators and government officials, who have given her mixed messages so far.

And if government officials make a legal exception for murder, they face another question: Where to draw the line for other criminal acts?"
24,111,2008-02-17T00:00:00Z,article,"For Patients, More Comfort and a Bigger Dose of Respect",547df74a38f0d84a61c0df79,"subject:Hospitals, glocations:Westchester County (NY), subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Nursing and Nurses",Regionals,0.0,N.Y. / Region,"Part marketing strategy and part effort to offer more humane treatment, some hospitals are creating an environment of tenderness, compassion and respect.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/17hospitalswe.html,1185,"Part marketing strategy and part effort to offer more humane treatment, some hospitals are creating an environment of tenderness, compassion and respect.","“There’s traditionally been nothing more disempowering than becoming a hospital patient,” said Joel Seligman, president and chief executive of Northern Westchester Hospital.

“If you went into a store, you’d expect respect and courtesy, so why shouldn’t that happen when you’re having an operation?” he said. “If someone is making an incision in your body, why shouldn’t you be able to fully understand that, fully understand the choices, fully communicate with people about what the plan is and how it’s going?”

Some of the changes Northern Westchester has made over the past six years are simple and relatively inexpensive. Patient rooms now have whiteboards, on which are written the names of the medical staff members who will be caring for them and the procedures patients can expect. Patients have easier access to their medical records. They can generally order meals when they want them and choose from a menu, rather than have a tray dropped off on a table.

Nightgowns with pink flowers and pinstriped pajamas have largely replaced thin cotton gowns. Integrative medicine — like aromatherapy, acupuncture, reiki and guided imagery — are offered in conjunction with traditional medicine.

Special attention has also been given to the ambience. Announcements on a public-address system are used only for emergency situations; rubber flooring further mutes noise. An instrument called the Yakker Tracker monitors decibel levels on the floors, and there are signs reminding staff members and visitors to quiet down. Original artwork, donated by a local museum, lines the hallways.

At Hudson Valley Hospital Center, in Cortlandt Manor, a new addition under construction will create a similar healing atmosphere, hospital officials say. Patient rooms will include more natural light, better views and natural plants. The project, scheduled to be completed in 2009, also aims to reduce noise and stress, all with an eye toward creating a calming atmosphere.

Many hospital changes are not cosmetic; they have more to do with attitude. Linda Rowell, staff development director at Four Winds Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Katonah, said that care could be transformed simply by remembering that a human being remained at the center of all the hospital’s work.

For instance, in the past, with large numbers of patients living in the same unit, shower times were scheduled throughout the day.

“From our point of view, you think cleanliness and structure,” Ms. Rowell said. “But as a patient, you think, ‘I’m being told my shower is at 3 p.m.’ From the human point of view, who wants the 3 p.m. shower? You want one in the morning or the evening.”

So at no cost and with a little flexibility, patients gained a little autonomy on when they would get clean.

Both Four Winds and Northern Westchester Hospitals are affiliated with Planetree, a nonprofit organization based in Connecticut that seeks to transform health care by understanding the perspective of the patient.

“The pressure that staff is under in all hospitals is just unbelievable,” said Janet Siegel, executive vice president for external affairs at Four Winds. “An affiliation with Planetree gives you a focus to rally around. There’s no more money, there’s no more people, there’s no more time. Now how are you going to make it better?”

At Northern Westchester Hospital’s outpatient cancer center, one way was to hang pictures of nature scenes on the ceiling, so patients who lie down during treatments have something to look at. If they choose, they are given headphones and guided imagery to help manage anxiety.

The waiting area has an almost spa-like feel, with lemon water and snacks of dried fruits and rice crackers. Volunteers offer hand massages, and patients wear thick terry cloth robes. Nurses offer aromatherapy — peppermint seems to help with nausea from chemotherapy. There is an herb garden, where aloe — which can be rubbed on radiation burns — grows.

There is also increasing recognition that hospitals might be nearly as traumatic for family members as they are for patients. More flexibility and support for visitors can help. The intensive care unit once strictly limited visitors’ access; now a family member can get a sleeper chair in the room. Even if a patient is facing a life-threatening situation, loved ones are not shooed away.

“When a family is present during an emergency procedure, it lets them see what we’re actually doing for a patient,” said Judy Kinkel, a nurse and manager of critical care at Northern Westchester. “Sometimes it works as a closure; they see that we did our best. Sometimes they just want to hold their hand for the final moments.”

When the stress of having a hospitalized family member is too much, relatives can visit Northern Westchester’s new center for “caregivers.” With its cozy chairs, faux fireplace, massage chair and waterfall sculpture, it is meant to be an oasis for visitors who need time away from a chronically ill patient’s bedside.

The center was the brainchild of Marian Hamilton, of Armonk, whose husband, Ken, died of lung cancer in 2004. Mrs. Hamilton said that when her husband was ill, his care was good, but no support services were available to her.

“It was such an overwhelmingly difficult time in our lives,” she said. “Every day is the same, and it’s relentless. I’d sit in this depressing waiting room thinking, what was I going to do with my life after my husband died?”

Mrs. Hamilton raised money for the center and planned it in detail, from stocking it with comfort food (peanut butter, oatmeal, cheese, cookies and warm drinks) to services — computers (“I’d go home exhausted and face a long list of e-mails,” she said), a library and volunteers trained to work with families in crisis.

Mr. Seligman, the Northern Westchester executive, said that many hospitals were working to improve the way they deliver care.

“We created unhappiness in the population at large by forcing them to give up all control of their lives when they enter a hospital,” he said. “Everyone is really playing catch-up in that area.”"

Until now, the search giant hasn’t had anything to show for its labors other than bumps along the way — delays and a management change.

But on Thursday, Google’s technology for personal health records, which is still in development, is getting a big endorsement from the Cleveland Clinic. The big medical center is beginning a pilot project to link the health information for some of its patients with Google personal health records.

Cleveland Clinic is at the cutting edge of health information technology, and its more than 100,000 patients each has a personal health record. But a sizable portion of those patients are retirees, notes Dr. C. Martin Harris, the clinic’s chief information officer. Many of them, he said, spend about five months elsewhere, typically in Florida or Arizona, and the clinic’s sophisticated electronic health records don’t follow them there.

“It forces the patient to become his or her own medical historian,” Dr. Harris said.

The Google personal health record, he said, is a solution to that problem, among others. A person can approve the transfer of information on, say, medical conditions, allergies, medications and laboratory results from the clinic’s computers to a Google personal health record — a series of secure Web pages.

The pilot project will last six to eight weeks, and involve less than 10,000 patients. The project with Cleveland Clinic is “a milestone” for Google, said Marissa Mayer, a vice president, who took over management of the health team six months ago.

Google’s personal health record is still in development, and it will be introduced publicly and made widely available, after the pilot project is concluded, Ms. Mayer said.

To be sure, Google is only one of several companies trying to make a business from Web-based personal health records. Microsoft, for example, brought out its entry, called HealthVault, last October, and it has commitments from medical centers including New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the Mayo Clinic. WebMD, Revolution Health and others also offer personal health records.

While it’s still not entirely clear what Google’s personal health record will be like, its approach seems to be ambitious and comprehensive. Google has its own user interface, while Microsoft, for example, appears to be focusing on back-end storage. Google is offering automated data links, so the patient does not have to type in personal data, as is required with some personal health records. And Google, along with Microsoft, has the deep pockets and technological knowhow to offer personal health records free to millions.

Other medical centers are ready to sign up. “This is truly a patient-controlled health record, and that’s a very significant step in the drive toward a more consumer-oriented system of health care,” said Dr. John D. Halamka, chief information officer of the Harvard Medical School.

In addition to the Sprint Fidelis and the heart stent cases — some in Massachusetts have named Boston Scientific rather than Johnson & Johnson as the defendant — lawyers said Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling could also affect the course of personal injury lawsuits filed against St. Jude Medical over a silver-coated heart valve recalled in 2000.

There were 19 state and federal cases pending involving the St. Jude valve as of last October, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the company, which is based in St. Paul.

Other lawsuits that could be affected are ones against Johnson & Johnson and Synthes over spinal disks, and Stryker over artificial hip components. Soundtec, an Oklahoma City-based producer of an implantable hearing aid, had been told just two weeks ago by the Arkansas State Supreme Court that the federal approval of its device did not protect it from a claim in state court that its design was defective. Lawyers say the Arkansas decision is now likely to be reversed.

Recent settlements of large groups of lawsuits on terms relatively favorable to device makers are a sign that lawyers had been anticipating the Supreme Court outcome, according to Mark Herrmann, a Chicago lawyer who defends drug and device companies.

In December, for example, Medtronic announced an agreement to pay $114.1 million to settle 2,682 injury lawsuits related to its 2005 recall of defibrillators with a defective battery. In November, Boston Scientific agreed to pay up to $240 million to settle 8,550 claims stemming from recalls of defibrillators made by a subsidiary, Guidant.

Plaintiffs in those cases are free to stay out of the settlements and try to continue suing the companies. But the odds against their success are much steeper now, according to both plaintiffs and defense lawyers.

The Supreme Court’s Riegel decision turned on interpretation of laws and regulations governing Class III medical devices, which include products that sustain life, prevent major health problems or might pose unreasonable risks if they malfunction.

The majority of Class III devices submitted for F.D.A. consideration — hundreds each year — are variants on products like standard pacemakers that were already in the market when the main law covering devices was passed by Congress in 1976. While companies must notify the F.D.A. when introducing such products, the agency does not require extensive safety and effectiveness testing before allowing them to be sold.

But many of the industry’s most sophisticated and profitable Class III devices — implants like defibrillators, newer pacemakers that balance the heart rate in different chambers of the heart, drug-coated stents to prop open arteries, artificial hips, spinal disks, knees and stimulators that control pain — are seen as so different from pre-1976 devices that they must undergo a more thorough safety and effectiveness review.

In Riegel, lawyers agree, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended that such a premarket approval process — known as P.M.A. — would bar patients from filing lawsuits that in effect, second-guess regulators’ judgments about the safety and effectiveness of devices they have reviewed. P.M.A. applications may take nine months or more to be processed and may include a hearing before a panel of outside experts.

The Supreme Court ruling also presumes that the labels companies develop to warn of side effects and limitations are adequate because they, too, receive F.D.A. review.

The F.D.A. handles 25 to 50 new P.M.A. reviews in a typical year. But the impact of Riegel extends far beyond those approvals. Each year, the F.D.A. handles hundreds of “supplements” to existing P.M.A.’s that reflect changes in the design or manufacture of products already on the market. Numerous lower court decisions say such supplements have the same legal status as the original approvals, even though they often receive cursory F.D.A. review and are approved in a matter of weeks.

The lawsuits related to the Sprint Fidelis lead fractures spotlight what critics of the Riegel decision have said is a serious flaw in the Supreme Court’s reasoning. They say the Sprint Fidelis lead, which was classified as a supplement to earlier leads, did not receive extensive F.D.A. scrutiny. “It was approved in less than 30 days,” Mr. Shkolnik said, ”even though there was a big change in how they welded the wires.”

Whether manufacturing changes had anything to do with the Sprint Fidelis problems remains to be proved. But the sheer number of such supplemental applications at the F.D.A. highlights how reliant the agency has become on the industry’s own data and analysis of potential vulnerabilities.

That could make supplemental applications a particular target of efforts in Congress to narrow or overturn the immunity from many types of lawsuits that manufacturers received in the court’s Riegel decision. Two crucial figures in the passage of the original 1976 device law, Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, and Senator Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Wednesday that the Riegel ruling was contrary to Congress’s intent and that they would introduce legislation to overturn it.

As things stand now, lawyers expect injury lawsuits to leave design questions behind and focus on whether patients were harmed because a company did not make or handle the product according to the safety processes laid out in the documents approved by the F.D.A.

“As sure as night follows day, every plaintiff is going to argue manufacturing defects,” Mr. Herrmann said. “That is the next battleground.”

Another question may be whether injury lawsuits are barred in cases where manufacturers deceived the regulators by providing false data or withholding data on safety and effectiveness to get their marketing approval.

But Riegel may lead many judges to dismiss claims before plaintiffs’ lawyers can gain access to company production data, e-mail and other records through the pretrial process known as discovery. “It takes discovery to prove violations of the federal regulations,” said Neil Overholtz, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who represents patients in device litigation.

Mr. Herrmann, who writes a blog about these issues (druganddevicelaw.blogspot.com), said Thursday that the decision put the onus on medical device companies and the F.D.A. to prove they can protect patients without the threat of product-injury lawsuits."

Addressing the trust issue, Meg McCabe, Aetna’s vice president for online programs, said, “We make sure the information is secured and shared, based on the member’s purposes.”

The information will not be used to raise or lower premiums or reject membership applications. “That would not be a good business decision,” Ms. McCabe said. “We need to develop a relationship with our members based on trust.”

Using a medical search engine developed by Healthline, a medical database software developer, Aetna is piecing together medical profiles that are based on records of each insured member’s illnesses and diagnostic tests and that also make assumptions about their health concerns as reflected in their search topics.

Andrea Rosenberg, a quality supervisor in an Aetna call center in Phoenix, said she had used the system to conduct research about her 5-year-old daughter Hayley’s ear infections and her own allergy symptoms.

Like the millions of working mothers — a segment who are major online searchers for health information — Ms. Rosenberg said she had searched other health Web sites but found that the Aetna site provided information that was “more specific” to her situation. After looking it over, she took Hayley to see the family pediatrician. As for her allergies, she decided to stick with nonprescription medicines from the drugstore.

Health plan members have been slow to add their information to personal health records offered by many insurers, at least until a family member gets sick. But Aetna and some other health insurers, including UnitedHealth and WellPoint, have made an end run around this obstacle by creating rudimentary health profiles based on medical claims data.

Aetna says it has gone further by using the profile to help tailor the SmartSource searches.

“I don’t know of anybody else who is matching members’ claims information with a search engine to help them look for medical content,” said Julie Snyder, a technology and health care analyst at Forrester Research.

But some industry experts say that medical claims data have limited utility, providing only “an echo of the events that go on in your care,” according to Wes Rishel, a senior health care analyst at the Gartner Group technology consulting firm. “Also, at any time, the information is 15 to 45 days old.”

Dr. Rishel said more useful data would eventually come directly from the person’s doctors and hospital visits. Google and Microsoft are trying to get that information, although he predicts it will take “about two years” to reach that goal.

Ms. McCabe said: “We are all angling to reach sort of the same goal — to take all the information that we know about you as an individual and link it to tools to make sure you are as engaged as possible in managing your health care.”"

As part of a push toward greater individual control of health information, Microsoft and Google have recently begun offering Web-based personal health records. The journal article’s authors describe a new “personalized, health information economy” in which consumers tell physicians, hospitals and other providers what information to send into their personal records, stored by Microsoft or Google. It is the individual who decides with whom to share that information and under what terms.

But Microsoft and Google, the authors note, are not bound by the privacy restrictions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, the main law that regulates personal data handling and patient privacy. Hipaa, enacted in 1996, did not anticipate Web-based health records systems like the ones Microsoft and Google now offer.

The authors say that consumer control of personal data under the new, unregulated Web systems could open the door to all kinds of marketing and false advertising from parties eager for valuable patient information.

Despite their warnings, Dr. Mandl and Dr. Kohane are enthusiastic about the potential benefits of Web-based personal health records, including a patient population of better-informed, more personally responsible health consumers.

“In very short order, a few large companies could hold larger patient databases than any clinical research center anywhere,” Dr. Mandl said in an interview.

But the authors see a need for safeguards, suggesting a mixture of federal regulation — perhaps extending Hipaa to online patient record hosts — contract relationships, certification standards and consumer education programs.

“I’m a great believer in patient autonomy in general, but there is going to have to be some measure of limited paternalism,” Dr. Kohane said in an interview.

Peter Neupert, the vice president in charge of Microsoft’s health group, said that he admired the authors and that they raised some important issues. But he resisted the suggestion of extending Hipaa to newcomers like Microsoft and Google.

“Philosophically and politically, I am skeptical of the concept of paternalism,” Mr. Neupert said in an e-mail response to the article, which he was sent, and to the authors’ comments. “It never turns out to be ‘limited.’ ”

Designing a health records system that clearly informs consumers and requires their consent for data use is the better approach, Mr. Neupert said.

“We have to earn the consumer’s trust for our brand,” he said. “So I can imagine a scenario where we have a third party verify that our system works the way we assert it does,” much as an auditor reviews a company’s financial reporting.

Dr. Mandl and Dr. Kohane are physicians and researchers at Children’s Hospital Boston, the primary pediatric teaching hospital of the Harvard Medical School."

She went to her oncologist to collect her medical records, only to discover they were stored in several different places.

My mom was weak and sick from chemotherapy, yet she traipsed from hospital to hospital to collect medical files, pathology reports and scan films. I remember her saying at the time, “Why can’t they all be in one place?”

Experiences like this have convinced me of the benefits of electronic medical records. Imagine how much easier it would have been for my mom to just send an electronic version of her medical files to the cancer center.

But now that big companies like Microsoft and Google are getting into the medical record storage business, a fascinating piece in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine raises important questions about whether medical privacy rules should be extended to these private firms. All you have to do is order a book on Amazon and you can quickly see how every move you make online is tracked by marketers.

As my colleague Steve Lohr wrote in Thursday’s Times, the authors of The New England Journal article say there are still more questions than answers about the new “personalized health information economy.”

The companies all hope to capitalize eventually on the trend of increasingly seeking health information online, and the potential of Internet tools to help consumers manage their own health care and medical spending.

Google enters the field of personal health records with a leading online brand, deep pockets and a wealth of technical skills. In a two-month trial this year, the Cleveland Clinic found that its patients were eager to use the Google health records.

But those records are typically controlled by the institutions, and are not portable when a person changes insurers or health providers or moves to another part of the country.

Both Microsoft and Google have previously announced collaborative pilot projects with other health providers. For Microsoft, they include the Mayo Clinic and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. For Google, they include the Cleveland Clinic and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

But the Kaiser move, analysts say, is significant given the California-based health company’s size and its reputation as an innovative user of information technology.

In the mid-1990s, Kaiser began offering its members the ability to ask health questions to nurses over the Web. In the last few years, it has gone much further with its Web-based My Health Manager personal health record, which enables patients to make appointments, send e-mail questions to doctors and place prescription orders online.

The adoption of Kaiser’s internal health record is growing at 100 percent a year, with 2.25 million of its patient members using it to date, Ms. Silvestre said.

Linking the consumer-controlled personal health record with the Kaiser record opens the door to sharing and supplementing information from the Kaiser system with other personal health information. The proliferation of personal health monitoring machines, from blood pressure machines to pedometers, could be included, along with records of diet and exercise routines.

The goal, health experts say, is to give people useful information so they can be more active in managing their own health. The biggest payoff would be in improving the self-management of chronic ailments, like diabetes, asthma, congestive heart disease and hypertension, which account for the majority of the nation’s health care bill.

“We think we can start to transform the management of chronic diseases,” said Peter Neupert, the vice president in charge of Microsoft’s health group.

The Kaiser partnership is a success for Microsoft’s early efforts to forge ties with health providers. Such information-sharing collaborations, analysts say, are crucial to the use of consumer-controlled personal health records, because individuals are not expected to type in large volumes of health information themselves.

Kaiser chose the Microsoft technology, even though Ms. Silvestre is a member of a group of health professionals advising Google. Ms. Silvestre said Kaiser had also looked closely at Google, but had been particularly impressed by Microsoft’s technology for protecting the privacy and security of personal data. And she said that Microsoft and Kaiser were using the same Web-based format, called a Continuity of Care Document, or CCD.

Ms. Silvestre said Google was initially focusing its efforts on a different format for Web health records, called Continuity of Care Record, or CCR.

But these different Web standards, analysts say, are not a long-term obstacle to the ability of consumer health records from rival companies to share and view information. Google, for example, is committed to supporting both formats, and so is Microsoft.

“Google will certainly be a player in this, and we look forward to working with them,” Ms. Silvestre said. “We’re all for consumer choice.”"

The economics of it just seem so daunting.”

Private and government insurers and hospitals can save money as a result of less paper handling, lower administration expenses and fewer unnecessary lab tests when they are connected to electronic health records in doctors’ offices. Still, it is mainly doctors who bear the burden making the initial investment.

“We have a broken market for electronic health record adoption because the people who gain financially are not the people who pay,” said Dr. Blackford Middleton, a health technology expert at Partners Healthcare, a nonprofit medical group that includes Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

To fix the market, Dr. Middleton, like others, recommends that the government play a role in providing incentives or subsidies to speed the use of computerized patient records in the United States, whose adoption rate trails most developed nations.

The government took a step in that direction last week, announcing a $150 million Medicare project that will offer doctors incentives to move from paper to electronic patient records. The program is intended to help up to 1,200 small practices in 12 cities and states make the conversion.

Individual doctors will be offered up to $58,000 over the five-year span of the project, which is intended to test the impact of incentives on the spread of electronic health records. Further programs across the country are planned.

The report published in the journal also found that electronic health records were used by 51 percent of larger practices, with 50 or more doctors.

Indeed, electronic health records are pervasive in the largest integrated medical groups like Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and others. These integrated groups not only have deep pockets. By combining doctors, clinics, hospitals and often some insurance they can also capture the financial savings from electronic health records.

The findings of the study, which was paid for by the Department of Health and Human Services and a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, broadly echo previous research on the adoption of electronic health records. Large medical groups have long been the early adopters, and small practices have struggled.

But the new study is based on a large sampling — more than 2,600 doctors across the country — and a detailed survey, making it more definitive than past research, experts say. The results, they say, also show a strong endorsement of electronic health records by doctors who have them, especially for what the report termed “fully functional” records, which include reminders of care guidelines, based on a patient’s age, gender or medical history.

For example, 82 percent of those using such electronic records said they improved the quality of clinical decisions, 86 percent said they helped in avoiding medication errors and 85 percent said they improved the delivery of preventative care.

“Those numbers are huge and very encouraging,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, the former health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration.

Dr. Brailer also pointed to the 54 percent of doctors without electronic health records who said that not finding an electronic health record that met their needs was a “major barrier” to adoption. In short, they are not satisfied with the existing products, which tend to be designed for hospitals — big customers — instead of small practices.

“What we see is a deficit in innovation, and that is something innovators and the capital markets can address,” said Dr. Brailer, who leads a firm that invests in medical ventures, Health Evolution Partners.

One wave of innovation is coming from big technology companies, like Microsoft and Google, which recently have begun services that offer consumer-controlled personal health records over the Web, which are stored in the companies’ data centers. These consumer-controlled health records are intended to link up and exchange information with electronic patient records in doctors’ offices and hospitals.

Dr. Peter Masucci, a pediatrician with his own office in Everett, Mass., embraced electronic health records to “try to get our practice into the 21st century.”

He could not afford conventional software, and chose a Web-based service from Athenahealth, a company supplying online financial and electronic health record services to doctors’ offices.

Dr. Masucci was already using Athenahealth’s outsourced financial service, and less than two years ago adopted the online medical record.

Today, Dr. Masucci is an enthusiast, talking about the wealth of patient information, drug interaction warnings and guidelines for care, all in the Web-based records.

“Do I see more patients because of this technology? Probably no,” Dr. Masucci said. “But I am doing a better job with the patients I am seeing. It almost forces you to be a better doctor.”"

The benefits of electronic patient records would extend beyond the ability to order prescriptions online and better clinical decisions. They would be a great benefit for epidemiological research requiring collection of data about disease incidence and prevalence, safety and efficacy of prescribed drugs after they have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and surgical procedures.

Without such electronic data, epidemiological research is far more time-consuming and expensive. It can take hours to go through paper records searching for cases with a rare disease or a toxic reaction to a prescribed drug, a task that would require just a few keystrokes with electronic records.

Issues of privacy are an additional concern. As we have all learned, the possibility of releasing millions of records is all too real.

Our health care system makes electronic health records a technical coating on top of a deeply flawed foundation. Addressing each of these issues, including the cost, in collaboration with doctors is much more likely to increase use of electronic records and achieve our common goal of improving the quality of care for all Americans.

To the Editor:

A doctor I see is one of the 4 percent of doctors who make full use of electronic records to assist their practices. It seems obvious to me that having lab results, previous clinical observations and recommendations at her fingertips enhances the care she provides.

On the other hand, visits to this doctor involve minutes spent while she locates my health records on the computer, and minutes spent as she enters new data, all the while with her gaze and attention fixed on the computer rather than on me. The tap-tap of her fingers indicates that she is too busy to be taking in whatever I have to tell her, and that the electronic task has been elevated over the old-fashioned hands-on approach to clinical care.

Once records are enshrined in my doctor’s computer, they are available for her use and the use of other doctors in her clinic. However, they fail to travel beyond the clinic to the office of my primary care doctor because apparently the task of faxing them over is too onerous in this high-tech age.

Getting electronic records to my primary care doctor, who oversees all aspects of my health, requires a more basic effort: a hand-carry by the patient.

So much, and so little, progress!

The United States health care system definitely needs to cut costs, increase use of electronic health records and improve the quality of patient care, as is happening in other countries. But those countries have something that we lack — a national health plan. Shouldn’t that tell us something? Nisson Schechter

Dr. Baron still gets a fee of only about $64 for each office visit. But his five-doctor group will also receive $200,000 to $300,000 this year beyond their regular fees to keep better track of their 8,400 patients.

“We are trying to do more e-mail care and telephone care, which we haven’t been paid for in the past,” Dr. Baron said.

Insurers are conducting similar pilot projects in at least a half-dozen states, in experiments involving thousands of doctors and nearly 2 million patients. Many more are in the planning stages, at the urging of health policy experts and employers that provide medical benefits.

The big government health care programs, Medicaid and Medicare, are also studying the concept. A Medicaid experiment already under way in North Carolina saved the government program in that state about $162 million in 2006. That was 11 percent less than the state would have spent under the old system of reimbursement, according to an audit by Mercer, a consulting firm.

Earlier this month, as part of a bill to protect Medicare payments to doctors, the Senate overrode President Bush’s veto to authorize $100 million to finance a three-year Medicare pilot to further test the concept of spending more on primary care.

Under the various payment experiments, family doctors are encouraged to hire additional staff to help monitor patients’ treatment and follow-up, and to help patients stay ahead of problems by sending reminders when they are due for preventive tests like mammograms and colon exams.

For people like Mr. Williamson with serious chronic illnesses, the doctors take personal charge, answering patients’ phone or e-mail questions promptly. In emergencies, patients can show up at the office and see their doctors on short notice.

Such features add up to a model of primary care that proponents refer to as providing people with a “medical home” — a base where doctors, staff and patients pull together as one big health-care family. Or at least that is the ideal.

“It’s the latest new, new thing — testing whether medical homes can be a vehicle for pulling America upwards from the grossly inefficient swamp in which our health system is currently mired,” said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a senior consultant at Mercer who is also member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency.

The panel has recommended that Medicare expand its plans for a medical-home pilot project next year that is expected to pay primary-care doctors in eight states $30 to $40 a month extra for each person enrolled with a chronic illness.

In Michigan, the auto industry has been a major force behind one of the largest medical-home projects yet devised. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which has 4.7 million members, plans to spend $30 million this year to help primary-care doctors offer such services. About 4,900 primary-care doctors are participating, said Dr. Thomas Simmer, chief medical officer of Michigan Blue Cross.

Advocates of the approach hope it will attract more doctors to primary care. Last year only 7 percent of medical school graduates chose family practice, a field with a median income of $150,000, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. That compares with $406,000 for gastroenterologists and $433,00 for cardiac surgeons, as measured by the Medical Group Management Association.

The American Medical Association said that in its latest count, in 2006, there were slightly more than 251,000 practicing family physicians, general, practitioners, and internists in this country, compared with nearly 472,000 specialists.

“The pipeline of primary-care doctors has been running dry for several years,” said Dr. Barbara Starfield, a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University. Many parts of the country do not meet the generally accepted standard of one primary-care doctor for every 1,000 to 2,000 people, Dr. Starfield said.

The Philadelphia pilot project is sponsored by three of the area’s largest insurers — Independence Blue Cross, Aetna and Cigna — as well as some local providers of Medicaid services, which together have agreed to spend $13 million on the program over the next three years.

Dr. Baron expects the project to add as much 15 percent to the annual revenue of his medical group. He declined to specify the practice’s total gross income last year, but said that each of the five physicians earned less than the $177,000 national median for internists.

To participate in the Philadelphia experiment, doctors must arrange for their offices to keep in close communication with their entire rosters of patients. Dr. Baron’s practice, besides the physicians, a business manager and clerical assistants, has added a patient educator, whom he said would cost $60,000 in salary plus $60,000 more for benefits and supporting technology. The group is also spending $25,000 for part-time services of a data analyst.

Employers predict that better early care will reduce their health costs in the long run. “We want to buy our care this way, we think it’s the right thing to do,” said Dr. Paul Grundy, I.B.M.’s director of health care technology and strategic initiatives.

Despite the hopes riding on the pilot projects, some experts are skeptical. “There is very little concrete rigorous evidence that the medical home will do all those wonderful things they want it to do,” said Mark Pauly, a health policy economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Even executives at Aetna and Cigna are cautious about betting on a payoff from the Philadelphia project, which was orchestrated by Pennsylvania’s Democratic Governor Edward G. Rendell and his office of health care reform.

It is uncertain whether there will be a direct return on the investment within a “reasonable time horizon,” said Dr. Don Liss, an Aetna medical director who is an internist himself. Still, Dr. Liss added, “a reasonable body of evidence suggests that improving primary care as a foundation for health care will improve quality and access to care.”

The Pennsylvania program will start expanding to other parts of the state this fall. It comes none too soon, in the view of Dr. Joseph Mambu, a family physician in Lower Gwynedd, a Philadelphia suburb. Trying to build a medical-home practice before the pilot project began, Dr. Mambu said he went into debt installing an electronic medical records system and establishing patient-friendly features like evening and Saturday office hours.

“Last year, I hit the red ink because of all the technology,” he said. “Unless we get help from the insurance companies and the government, the system is going down the toilet.”

But with the new medical-home money, Dr. Mambu said he expected to pay down his debts and start a patient wellness program. The insurance pilot project, he said, offers “a ray of hope.”"
36,50,2008-08-03T00:00:00Z,article,Immigrants Facing Deportation by U.S. Hospitals,534bdd8c38f0d858e6406fb7,"subject:Immigration and Refugees, subject:Medicine and Health, glocations:United States, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, organizations:Sinai Hospital, glocations:Guatemala",National,0.0,None,Many hospitals are taking it upon themselves to repatriate seriously injured or ill immigrants because nursing homes won't accept them without insurance.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/us/03deport.html,6114,Many hospitals are taking it upon themselves to repatriate seriously injured or ill immigrants because nursing homes won’t accept them without insurance.,"“Every time, he loses a little more of himself,” his mother, Petrona Gervacio Gaspar, said in Kanjobal, the Indian dialect that she speaks with an otherworldly squeak.

Mr. Jiménez’s benchmark case exposes a little-known but apparently widespread practice. Many American hospitals are taking it upon themselves to repatriate seriously injured or ill immigrants because they cannot find nursing homes willing to accept them without insurance. Medicaid does not cover long-term care for illegal immigrants, or for newly arrived legal immigrants, creating a quandary for hospitals, which are obligated by federal regulation to arrange post-hospital care for patients who need it.

American immigration authorities play no role in these private repatriations, carried out by ambulance, air ambulance and commercial plane. Most hospitals say that they do not conduct cross-border transfers until patients are medically stable and that they arrange to deliver them into a physician’s care in their homeland. But the hospitals are operating in a void, without governmental assistance or oversight, leaving ample room for legal and ethical transgressions on both sides of the border.

Indeed, some advocates for immigrants see these repatriations as a kind of international patient dumping, with ambulances taking patients in the wrong direction, away from first-world hospitals to less-adequate care, if any.

“Repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases,” said Dr. Steven Larson, an expert on migrant health and an emergency room physician at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. “I’ve seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country, and once that person is out of sight, he’s out of mind.”

Hospital administrators view these cases as costly, burdensome patient transfers that force them to shoulder responsibility for the dysfunctional immigration and health-care systems. In many cases, they say, the only alternative to repatriations is keeping patients indefinitely in acute-care hospitals.

“What that does for us, it puts a strain on our system, where we’re unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens,” said Alan B. Kelly, vice president of Scottsdale Healthcare in Arizona. “A full bed is a full bed.”

Medical repatriations are happening with varying frequency, and varying degrees of patient consent, from state to state and hospital to hospital. No government agency or advocacy group keeps track of these cases, and it is difficult to quantify them.

A few hospitals and consulates offered statistics that provide snapshots of the phenomenon: some 96 immigrants a year repatriated by St. Joseph’s Hospital in Phoenix; 6 to 8 patients a year flown to their homelands from Broward General Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; 10 returned to Honduras from Chicago hospitals since early 2007; some 87 medical cases involving Mexican immigrants — and 265 involving people injured crossing the border — handled by the Mexican consulate in San Diego last year, most but not all of which ended in repatriation.

Over all, there is enough traffic to sustain at least one repatriation company, founded six years ago to service this niche — MexCare, based in California but operating nationwide with a “network of 28 hospitals and treatment centers” in Latin America. It bills itself as “an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded Latin American nationals,” promising “significant saving to U.S. hospitals” seeking “to alleviate the financial burden of unpaid services.”

Many hospitals engage in repatriations of seriously injured and ill immigrants only as a last resort. “We’ve done flights to Lithuania, Poland, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico,” said Cara Pacione, director of social work at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago. “But out of about a dozen cases a year, we probably fly only a couple back.”

Other hospitals are more aggressive, routinely sending uninsured immigrants, both legal and illegal, back to their homelands. One Tucson hospital even tried to fly an American citizen, a sick baby whose parents were illegal immigrants, to Mexico last year; the police, summoned by a lawyer to the airport, blocked the flight. “It was horrendous,” the mother said.

Sister Margaret McBride, vice president for mission services at St. Joseph’s in Phoenix, which is part of Catholic Healthcare West, said families were rarely happy about the hospital’s decision to repatriate their relatives. But, she added, “We don’t require consent from the family.”

In a case this spring that outraged Phoenix’s Hispanic community, St. Joseph’s planned to send a comatose, uninsured legal immigrant back to Honduras, until community leaders got lawyers involved. While they were negotiating with the hospital, the patient, Sonia del Cid Iscoa, 34, who has been in the United States for half her life and has seven American-born children, came out of her coma. She is now back in her Phoenix home.

“I can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her,” John M. Curtin, her lawyer, said. “The good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided — reluctantly, and, sadly enough, only in response to legal and public pressure.”

Unlike Ms. Iscoa and Mr. Jiménez, most uninsured immigrant patients in repatriation cases do not have advocates fighting for them, and they are quietly returned to their home countries. Sometimes, their families accept that fate because they are told they have no options; sometimes they are grateful to the hospital for paying their fare home, given that other hospitals leave it to relatives or consulates to assume responsibility for the patients.

Mr. Jiménez’s case is apparently the first to test the legality of cross-border patient transfers that are undertaken without the consent of the patients or their guardians — and the liability of the hospitals who undertake them.

“We’re the rhesus monkey on this issue,” said Scott Samples, a spokesman for Martin Memorial.

A Life-Changing Accident

Mr. Jiménez’s journey north was propelled by the usual migrant’s dreams. When he pledged thousands of dollars to pay the smuggler who delivered him to the United States, he envisioned years of labor on the lawns of affluent America and then a payoff: the means to buy land of his own, to cultivate his own garden, back in Guatemala.

But fate — in the person of Donald Flewellen, a pipe welder with a drug problem and a long criminal record — intervened. At lunchtime on Feb. 28, 2000, Mr. Flewellen was loitering in the parking lot of a Publix supermarket in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., when the employees of an irrigation company ran inside, leaving the keys in their van. Seizing the moment, Mr. Flewellen, a thorn in the side of local prosecutors with at least 14 arrests, jumped into the van and drove off.

In the next few hours, Mr. Flewellen consumed enough alcohol to produce a blood-alcohol level four times higher than the legal limit. But drive he did, along the back roads that connect the affluent Treasure Coast to the agricultural interior where Guatemalan Mayan immigrants have settled in a place, coincidentally, called Indiantown.

About 4 p.m., Mr. Flewellen was heading east on a rural road just as Mr. Jiménez and three compatriots were returning home from a day of landscaping. His stolen van and their 1988 Chevrolet Beretta crashed head-on, instantly killing two of the Guatemalans and severely injuring the driver and Mr. Jiménez, a back-seat passenger.

Identified first as John Doe, Mr. Jiménez arrived by ambulance at Martin Memorial, a not-for-profit hospital on the banks of the St. Lucie River in Stuart. He was unconscious and in shock from extensive bleeding, with two broken thigh bones, a broken arm, multiple internal injuries, a terribly lacerated face and a severe head injury. A doctor noted his prognosis as “poor.”

But Mr. Jiménez, after intensive surgical and medical intervention, survived. “He was no longer Luis; he was another person,” Montejo Gaspar Montejo, his cousin by marriage, said, describing a previously husky and industrious laborer who was also a soccer enthusiast. “He didn’t talk. He didn’t understand anything. He stayed curled up in a ball. But he was alive.”

During that time, Martin Memorial asked Michael R. Banks, a local lawyer who specializes in estate planning, to set up a guardianship for Mr. Jiménez. “I said, ‘Sure, what can come of such a case?’ ” Mr. Banks said. “Then it took on a life of its own. They probably regret they ever called me.”

Mr. Jiménez, whose common-law wife and two children remained in Guatemala, had been living for just under a year with Mr. Gaspar’s family. Mr. Gaspar, who works in golf-course maintenance, agreed to serve as guardian.

At first, things were amicable. In the summer of 2000, Mr. Jiménez was transferred to a nursing home in Stuart, which may have accepted him because an insurance payout was possible.

Mr. Flewellen, who eventually pleaded guilty to D.U.I. manslaughter, D.U.I. injury and grand theft auto, was not insured. But the Guatemalan families sought to hold the irrigation company liable since its employees left the keys in the car. Their lawsuit ultimately failed.

In the nursing home, Mr. Jiménez began wasting away. His relatives grew anxious. Then, Robert L. Lord Jr., Martin Memorial’s vice president of legal services, said, “Mr. Jiménez was put back on our doorstep.”

He arrived by ambulance, this time emaciated and suffering from ulcerous bed sores so deep that the tendons behind his knees were exposed. With infection raging, “the question to be answered is if the patient’s condition is terminal,” a doctor wrote in his file.

Again, Martin Memorial’s doctors provided life-saving care. Hospitals are mandated to treat and stabilize anyone suffering from an emergency medical condition, and the federal government does provide emergency Medicaid coverage for illegal and new immigrants.

But hospitals say that emergency Medicaid covers only a small fraction of those expenses: $80,000 in Mr. Jiménez’s case, according to court papers.

Mr. Jiménez remained in a vegetative state, coiled in a fetal position, for “one year, two months and 15 days,” Mr. Gaspar said with precision.

Stunning his relatives and medical officials, though, Mr. Jiménez gradually woke up and started interacting with the world. “One day,” Mr. Gaspar said in Spanish, “we arrived for a visit, and he said to me, ‘You are Montejo.’ ”

Not long afterward, the battle began between Martin Memorial and Mr. Gaspar, a reserved man whose Indiantown living room is decorated with a “We Love America” clock, a beach towel from the ancient city of Tikal and a hammered metal image of the Virgin Mary.

A Hospital’s Dilemma

The average stay at Martin Memorial, a relatively tranquil hospital which features a palm frond design in its gleaming lobby floor and white-coiffed volunteers in its gift shop, is 4.1 days and costs $8,188. Patients rarely linger.

Those like Mr. Jiménez who outstay their welcome are an oddity but not an anomaly. Mr. Jiménez had a roommate from Jamaica, a diabetic who lost both legs. Martin Memorial eventually flew him back to his native country, too.

In addition to trauma patients, there are uninsured immigrants with serious health problems. “In our emergency room, we don’t turn anyone away,” said Carol Plato Nicosia, the director of corporate business services. “The real problem is if we find an underlying problem, and now we have six of them — six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis.”

One of the six, she said, voluntarily returned to Guatemala after receiving a poor prognosis. But she showed up at Martin Memorial again after her relatives insisted that she undertake the trek over the borders a second time because she could not get treatment in Guatemala, Ms. Plato Nicosia said.

“I don’t want to sound heartless,” Ms. Plato Nicosia said. “A community hospital is going to give care. But is it the right thing? We have a lot of American citizens who need our help. We only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if we’re lucky. We need to make capital improvements and do things for our community.”

Martin Memorial reported a total margin of 3.6 percent over its bottom line last year and 6 percent in 2006. According to the most recent statewide data, the nonprofit medical center also reported assets of $270.6 million in 2006, with its senior executives earning more than $4 million in salaries and benefits.

Tax-exempt hospitals are expected to dedicate an unspecified part of their services to charity cases, and Martin Memorial devoted $23.9 million in 2006, about 3 percent, which was average for Florida, according to state data.

Mr. Jiménez was a very expensive charity case. In cases like his, where patients need long-term care, hospitals are not allowed to discharge them to the streets. Federal regulations require them — if they receive Medicare payments, and most hospitals do — to transfer or refer patients to “appropriate” post-hospital care.

But in most states, the government does not finance post-hospital care for illegal immigrants, for temporary legal immigrants or for legal residents with less than five years in the United States. (California and New York City are notable exceptions; Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program, spends $20 million a year on long-term care for illegal immigrants, as does the Health and Hospitals Corporation of New York City.)

Martin Memorial’s lawyer, Mr. Lord, said hospitals should not be forced to assume financial and legal responsibility for these cases. “It should be a governmental burden,” he said, “or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do.”

In Mr. Jiménez’s case, the hospital’s doctors determined that appropriate post-hospital care meant traumatic brain injury rehabilitation. Much to the surprise of the hospital staff, Mr. Jiménez had regained cognitive function to about the level of a fourth-grade child.

Hospital discharge planners searched to no avail for a rehabilitation program or nursing home. “Unable to take patient” was the response to many queries, as noted in Mr. Jiménez’s files, which also state: “At this time, patient remains a disposition problem.”

Representing Mr. Jiménez’s guardian, Mr. Banks took the position that the hospital had a responsibility to provide Mr. Jiménez with the rehabilitation he needed — even if it meant paying a rehabilitation center to provide it. That, he noted, could have benefited both the hospital and the patient.

“It would have been more cost-effective for them,” Mr. Banks said, given that daily patient costs in long-term care are far lower than in acute-care hospitals. “And if the rehab worked, then Luis might have become a functional person and nobody’s charge.”

But the hospital declined, as Mr. Lord put it, “to take out our checkbook” and subsidize his care at another institution.

“Once you take that step, for how long are you going to do that — a year, 10 years, 50 years?” Mr. Lord, the lawyer, asked.

At that point, the hospital intensified its efforts to involve the Guatemalan government in the case. In a memorandum obtained by The New York Times, a consular official wrote that the hospital “informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for Luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state won’t assume responsibility for his charges.”

Eventually, the Guatemalan health minister wrote a letter assuring Martin Memorial that his country was prepared to care for Mr. Jiménez. Gabriel Orellana, who was foreign minister at the time but did not have direct knowledge of the case, said the Guatemalan government was disposed to assist an American institution. “If a hospital in Florida asks if we can take care of a Guatemalan patient, the tendency is to say yes,” Mr. Orellana said.

Mr. Gaspar was dubious, believing the public health care system in his homeland to be grossly inadequate.

So the guardian and the hospital reached an impasse, and Martin Memorial finally took the matter to court, asking a state judge to compel Mr. Gaspar to cooperate with its repatriation plan. In June 2003, a hearing was held before Circuit Judge John E. Fennelly.

The Journey Home

In the courthouse in Stuart, a low-key, upscale town that boasts world-class fishing, George F. Bovie III, a lawyer for Martin Memorial, addressed the judge: “This case is not simply a case, as some would try and paint it, of money. This is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government” is prepared to receive and treat him.

Mr. Banks responded: “Your honor, this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly,” adding that the hospital sought to “have this court legitimize its patient dumping.”

By the time of the hearing, Mr. Jiménez was essentially a boarder at the hospital, wheeling around the hallways and hanging out at the nursing stations. Diana Gregory, a nurse who supervises case management and discharge planning, said in a recent interview that Mr. Jiménez — “I will affectionately call him Louie” — became “like family” to hospital staff members, who bought him birthday cakes, knitted him blankets and gave him toys.

According to hospital records, however, it was not all pastries and presents. Mr. Jiménez grew depressed as he gradually became more cognizant of his situation. He showed signs of regression, too. Emotional and behavioral volatility often follow serious head injuries, and Ms. Gregory said that Mr. Jiménez had developed some disturbing habits, including spitting, yelling out, kicking and defecating on the floor.

In court, his doctor, Walter Gil, testified that Mr. Jiménez would benefit from returning to the intimacy of his family. In his case file, the doctor had noted that Mr. Jiménez had told him, “Estoy triste,” meaning, “I’m sad.”

Dr. Gil said he asked Mr. Jiménez, “Why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you?” And, he said, Mr. Jiménez replied, “I miss my family and my wife.”

Mr. Banks’s witnesses challenged what they described as Guatemala’s vague offer to care for Mr. Jiménez.

Dr. Miguel Garcés, a prominent Guatemalan physician and public health advocate, said in a deposition that serious rehabilitation “is almost nonexistent” in Guatemala outside private facilities. He predicted that Mr. Jiménez would be taken in and then released from the country’s one public rehabilitation hospital within a matter of weeks.

“I don’t want him to go home and die,” Dr. Garcés said.

“Nobody wants him to go home and die,” the hospital’s lawyer responded.

A few weeks later, Judge Fennelly ruled. “This Court,” he wrote, “sails on uncharted seas.” He acknowledged that his decision might provoke dissent but opined, “As Aquinas once stated, ‘The good is not the enemy of the perfect,’ ” inverting and misattributing Voltaire’s famous quote, “The perfect is the enemy of the good.”

And then he granted the hospital’s petition, ordering that Mr. Gaspar stop “frustrating” the hospital’s plan to “relocate the ward” back to Guatemala.

Mr. Banks was stunned. He filed a notice of appeal and asked for a stay of the court’s order while the appeal was pending. The judge asked the hospital to file a response by 10 a.m. on July 10 before he ruled on the stay.

Four and a half hours before that response was due, shortly before daybreak on July 10, 2003, an ambulance picked up Mr. Jiménez at the hospital and drove him to the St. Lucie County airport, where an air ambulance waited to transport him back to Guatemala. Mr. Gaspar was not apprised.

“We went to see him at the hospital, and his bed was empty,” he said.

The hospital’s lawyer declined to comment on why the hospital did not wait for the judge to rule on the stay.

Diana Gregory, the nurse, traveled to Guatemala with Mr. Jiménez, bringing a wheelchair, a week’s worth of medications, “lunch/snacks/juices/treats,” and an emergency passport signed with a fingerprint, according to discharge records. Mr. Jiménez wore a Florida Marlins cap and carried a toy cellphone.

During the flight, the records said, Mr. Jiménez dozed, paged through picture books, pushed the window shade up and down and pointed outside, saying, “Look, look!” When he arrived in Guatemala, an ambulance took him to the National Hospital for Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, which occupies the converted stables of an old villa in the historic center of the capital city.

Ms. Gregory accompanied him there, turned over his records and toured the hospital. In a recent interview, Ms. Gregory said she was impressed by the place and especially by the staff’s pride in it, despite equipment that looked “like it could have been donated to the Smithsonian.” She added, “That facility could have taken care of me any day.”

While Ms. Gregory was taking her tour, Mr. Jiménez was holding court, according to her notes in his file, “telling everyone that he was from Miami, Florida, and showing them his toy cat.” At her request, a physician told Mr. Jiménez in Spanish “that he would be staying with his new friends in Guatemala and that I was leaving.” His response, according to her notes: “O.K., O.K., adiós.”

Glad that she had helped reunite Mr. Jiménez with his homeland, she said, “I left Guatemala quiet in my heart.”

Care in Guatemala

Immaculately clean but dilapidated, Guatemala’s National Hospital for Orthopedics and Rehabilitation operates on a shoestring budget of approximately $400,000 a year, according to Dr. Harold Von Ahn, who was director when Mr. Jiménez arrived.

Half the hospital is devoted to orthopedic care and the other half serves as an “asylum” for profoundly disabled Guatemalans. Although it is the only public rehabilitation hospital in the country, it dedicates just 32 beds to rehabilitation and does not offer the specialized brain injury treatment that Mr. Jiménez needed.

The Guatemalan foreign ministry said that it knew of 53 repatriations by American hospitals in the last five years. During a visit by The Times to the National Hospital in June, the most recent arrival was an 18-year-old, Diana Paola Miguel, transported there by the University Medical Center in Tucson nine days after a van accident crushed her pelvis, which the Arizona hospital repaired. Supine on a gurney, she Ms. Paola was too tremblingly upset to talk.

Dr. Von Ahn said he believed that American hospitals were dumping patients that should be their responsibility. “It’s the same as the classic fall on the stairs, right?” he said. “You go to my home, you fall on my stairs and then you sue me. I am responsible.”

Shortly after Mr. Jiménez arrived, the Guatemalan hospital contacted his common-law wife, Fabiana Domingo Laureano, who lived in the city of Antigua with their two young sons, and asked her to come get him. Ms. Domingo, who was 27 at the time, was shocked to learn that her husband was back and terrified by the request. Then as now, she was eking out a living, selling traditional woven clothing in a marketplace while sharing a spare, concrete room with her sons in her parents’ humble home.

“I was already living from hand to mouth,” she said in an interview in Antigua, where her sons now supplement her income by selling cigarettes after school. “How could I possibly have given him what he needs?”

The couple met as teenagers in the highland village of Soloma. In the mid-1990s, Mr. Jiménez migrated with his wife’s family to Antigua, a volcano-ringed colonial city where tourism sustains the local economy. While she sold clothing, Mr. Jiménez worked as a bus driver’s assistant. Together, they earned about $6 a day, which was not enough to support their family, so Mr. Jiménez, with his wife’s brother, Francisco Gaspar, decided to follow a well-traveled path to the north. That is when he changed his name from Gervacio Gaspar to Luis Jiménez, which is how he is now known, even by his family.

After pledging to pay a coyote, or smuggler, about $2,000 each to ferry them into the United States, they crossed into California under cover of darkness and made their way to Encinitas, where Mr. Jiménez’s older brother lived, Mr. Gaspar said.

After the two men failed to find regular work, Mr. Gaspar began suffering panic attacks and returned to Guatemala; Mr. Jiménez decided to try his luck in Florida.

“Lamentably,” Mr. Gaspar said, “luck eluded him.”

After the hospital contacted Ms. Domingo, Telemundo, the Spanish-language network, called Ms. Domingo and offered to take her to Guatemala City. Shortly thereafter, the network showed her reunion with her husband.

“You are Maria by chance?” Mr. Jiménez said to his wife as the television cameras rolled.

“Fabiana,” she replied. Their two sons stood by her side, wide-eyed.

A few weeks later, Dr. Von Ahn said, the hospital discharged Mr. Jiménez “because we needed the bed,” transferring him to another public hospital, San Juan de Dios. That is where Mr. Jiménez’s brother, Enrique Lucas Gervacio, found him when he made his way down from the mountains by bus.

“He was lying in the hallway on a stretcher, covered in his own excrement,” Mr. Lucas said. “So we cleaned him up and we brought him home.”

In Favor of Jiménez

In May, 2004, a Florida appeals court overruled Judge Fennelly.

The Fourth District Court of Appeal found that the Florida state judge had overstepped his bounds because deportation is the prerogative of the federal government. The court also declared that no evidence supported the hospital’s assertion that Mr. Jiménez would receive appropriate care in Guatemala; the discharge plan, the ruling said, was not detailed enough to satisfy federal requirements or the hospital’s own rules.

The appeals court voided the judge’s order although, given that Mr. Jiménez was already back in Guatemala, that action came too late for him.

It might affect others, though. The decision has become what is known legally as a case of first impression on the issue of hospital repatriations.

John DeLeon, a lawyer who advises the consulates of Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala in Miami, said he now referred to it when he received calls from hospitals looking to discharge seriously injured or ill immigrants.

“I now write I call my Montejo Gaspar letter,” he said. “It’s a letter that says, ‘Listen, don’t take action to dump this individual because you’ll be risking legal action. The law is now that hospitals can’t dump immigrant patients without securing appropriate after-care. If somebody has a serious illness and needs continuing care, a hospital can’t simply discharge them onto the street, much less put them on a plane.’ ”

Mr. DeLeon said that he was “bombarded by such cases,” adding that he was investigating another medical repatriation by Martin Memorial, which took place two weeks ago “behind the back of the Mexican government.”

Martin Memorial confirmed that on July 16 they flew Neptali Díaz, a severely brain-injured patient to Mexico. A court order authorized Mr. Diaz’s transfer to an unspecified Mexican hospital, ending the man’s 859-day, $2 million stay at Martin Memorial.

After the ruling in Mr. Jiménez’s favor, Martin Memorial did not appeal. But the case did not go away. The appeals court ruling set the stage for a personal injury lawsuit, taken on by Searcy, Denney, Scarola, Barnhart & Shipley in West Palm Beach.

With that established firm behind him, Mr. Gaspar initiated a false imprisonment action claiming that his cousin was essentially kidnapped by the hospital and smuggled out of the country in a kind of medical rendition. Since then, appeals judges have again ruled in Mr. Jiménez’s favor, stating the hospital can be sued for punitive damages as well as for the cost of his medical care.

This infuriates Ms. Plato Nicosia, the hospital administrator, who said it was Mr. Jiménez’s family who owes the hospital money and not vice versa. “Should they win, we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill,” she said.

Jack Scarola, representing Mr. Jiménez’s guardian, said that he empathized with the hospital’s “significant economic burden” but said that it was the “quid pro quo” of accepting Medicare and Medicaid funds to help finance the hospital’s services. (About 45 percent of Martin Memorial’s net operating revenues came from Medicare and Medicaid last year, based on state data.)

“Also,” he continued, “they chose the wrong way to deal with it. The right way would have been through the Legislature. There is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured, and there should be. But you don’t stick a brain-injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours.”

Weighing Quality of Life

The journey to Jolomcú is an arduous one, as Mr. Jiménez’s new legal team discovered when several members — a lawyer, a paralegal, a priest and a bioethicist — first traveled there to meet him.

After a five-hour drive north from Guatemala City to Huehuetenango and then a winding trip, filled with hairpin turns on cliff-hugging roads up and over the Cuchumatán Mountains, they arrived at the provincial city of Soloma.

From there, the road to Mr. Jiménez’s hamlet only goes so far, and the trip must be completed on foot, up and down a rutted dirt path through goat-strewn meadows. The Americans arrived at the top panting. There, awaiting them, in an idyllically situated one-room brick house, was Mr. Jiménez, a broad grin lighting up his face.

“The first striking thing was his disposition: He was very, very happy,” said the Rev. Frank O’Loughlin, who pastored migrant workers in South Florida for decades. “Then, the second thing, he was well cared for. What I did was I got down over him and hugged him but also smelled. And there were no bedsores. Nothing was malodorous.”

As they drove back to Huehuetenango, Marnie R. Poncy, a nurse-lawyer who runs a bioethics law project in Palm Beach County, offered her view: “I said, ‘His quality of life is better than it would be in an American nursing home.’ ”

“But I hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed,” she said.

Still, the team reached a conclusion that surprised them: “There was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to Florida,” Father O’Loughlin said. “We needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in Guatemala.”

Help has been slow in arriving.

When The Times took the trek to visit him in late June, Mr. Jiménez had not budged from his hilltop home since returning there and no medical professional had visited him, either. With his mother too frail to move him into his wheelchair, his life had shrunken to the confines of his bed, across from his mother’s.

During the visit, Mr. Jiménez, wearing a nubby Adidas hat and a ski jacket, sat wrapped in a Guatemalan blanket; his mother, who wore a traditional woven skirt, with a floral scarf braided through her long gray hair, stood by his side. She patted his head; he reached out to pick lint from her sweater.

A few days prior, he had suffered a particularly violent seizure.

“He was almost dead,” his mother, Mrs. Gervacio, said in Kanjobal, which was translated into Spanish by a school principal serving as interpreter. “For many years, I am caring for him like he is a baby, changing his diaper, washing him. But this is worse. I am worried to leave him alone at all.”

She is right to worry, said physicians consulted for this article. Patients suffering seizure disorders run the risk of injuring themselves — and of increasing their brain damage.

Still, Mrs. Gervacio does leave from time to time, she said, to go to Mass, shutting the door behind her and hoping for the best.

“It scares me a lot when you leave, Mama!” Mr. Jiménez blurted out, revealing that he was intently following the conversation that at first took place as if he were not there.

Given that Mr. Jiménez’s mother’s health is failing, the family worries about the future, too. And Mr. Jiménez shares their concern. “The day my mother is no longer, what’s going to happen to me?” he said. “This is what I have on my mind.”

Mr. Jiménez, whose memory is patchy, said he remembered nothing about his time in the United States — not Indiantown, not his job as a gardener, not the accident and not the hospital.

He does, remember the dreams that propelled his migration, and he expressed them eloquently: “I headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back, bent over, determined to better himself,” he said. “Other people had things so I thought, ‘Why not me?’ But now I regret it. Maybe God was punishing me for my illusions.”

“No, Luis,” the interpreter interjected, “it was just chance, an accident, a car accident.”

In Guatemala City, Dr. Garcés, the public health advocate, said that he was not surprised that, as he had predicted, Mr. Jiménez never received further medical care. “That’s the usual story of patients that are released from the National Orthopedic Hospital,” he said.

Dr. Garcés called Mr. Jiménez’s repatriation “inhumane.”

“In cases like that, if you cut the medical care, you’re hurting that person,” Dr. Garcés said. “You’re doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do. That goes against every international convention of human rights and health. To send him to Guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that, and that’s not fair.”

Without evaluation, doctors cannot know what potential for rehabilitation — or survival — Mr. Jiménez possesses.

If Mr. Jiménez’s guardian were to prevail in the lawsuit, “it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs,” Dr. Garcés said. “And transportation could be arranged.” But the case could drag on for years.

On the day of The Times’s visit, before Mr. Jiménez ate a lunch of eggs, tortillas and sugar water, Mr. Banks, the lawyer, gave him a present from his cousins in Florida — a plastic bag bulging with tube socks, undershirts and oversize sweatpants. Mr. Jiménez fingered the clothing with little interest but when a reporter began to read him the accompanying letter in Spanish, he snatched it excitedly from her hands.

Much to the surprise of his visitors, Mr. Jiménez, despite his brain injury, could read. He smoothed out the yellow legal paper from Mr. Gaspar and began: “I am sending you some little things. Luis, I hope that you like them.”

At first, Mr. Jiménez read haltingly, then more fluidly. Later, when all his visitors had gone outside, he read the ending aloud again to himself.

“I want to tell you,” he read, “that we miss you and love you a lot. May God continue to bless you.”

Mr. Jiménez smiled, and repeated, softly, “May God continue to bless you.”"

Biden Jr. of Delaware, 65, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, had emergency surgery in 1988 for an aneurysm in an artery in his brain and elective surgery for a second one. His campaign released 49 pages of medical records to The New York Times late last week showing that he was healthy, but the documents did not indicate whether he had had a test in recent years to detect any new aneurysm.

The two other nominees are younger and apparently in good health, but less is known about their medical history. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, 47, the Democratic presidential nominee, released a one-page, undated letter from his personal physician in May stating that he was in “excellent” health. Late last week, his campaign released the results of standard laboratory tests and electrocardiograms from his checkups in June 2001, November 2004 and January 2007. The findings were normal.

Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, 44, Mr. McCain’s running mate, has released no medical information.

There may be no serious problems with the health of any of the nominees. But absent fuller disclosure, there is no way for the electorate to know.

The health of the four nominees is a matter of concern because in the past a number of candidates, and in some cases their doctors and aides, have distorted, kept secret or spoken about the facts only at the last minute when medical events forced the issue. Examples include Senator Thomas F. Eagleton (depression), Senator Paul E. Tsongas (cancer), Senator Bill Bradley (heart rhythm abnormality) and, as a vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney (heart disease).

I am a physician who has covered the health of presidential candidates for 36 years. Since 1980, The Times has made it a practice to question nominees for president and other high political offices and, with their permission, their doctors about their health.

The Times has requested such interviews with Mr. Obama since last spring and with Mr. McCain and his doctors since March 2007. None were granted. More recently, The Times sent letters to all four nominees requesting interviews about their health with them and their doctors. None agreed.

The candidates’ health has drawn little attention for most of this long campaign season despite the importance of the issue. But since Mr. McCain selected Ms. Palin as his running mate in August, questions about his health have intensified. In recent weeks, more than 2,700 physicians have signed a petition that ran as an advertisement demanding that Mr. McCain fully release his health records; the petition is sponsored by Brave New Films, the company led by Robert Greenwald, a Hollywood filmmaker who has contributed $2,250 to Democratic candidates and has made a number of anti-McCain videos. Beyond the advertisement, Mr. McCain’s health has become the subject of both speculation and distortion on the Internet and other media.

The following is a summary of the publicly known medical information about all four nominees and the outstanding questions about each.

John McCain

Mr. McCain’s difficulty raising his arms and his sometimes awkward gait are remnants of severe, untreated injuries he suffered in Vietnam. Mr. McCain, a Navy pilot, broke both arms and his right knee when his jet was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967. He experienced additional wounds while being tortured during his five and a half years as a prisoner of war. Mr. McCain may eventually need joint replacements, according to his doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Mr. McCain has released more details about his health than the other three nominees, though he has done so in a phased way and has apparently not agreed to any extensive interviews about his health. A handful of reporters were allowed to view his records during his bid for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. Another group of reporters were permitted to see newer records last May. By not allowing reporters to interview him or his doctors extensively about his entire medical history, he has made it impossible to get a complete picture of his diagnoses and treatment.

In 1999, early in his first run for the presidency, Mr. McCain allowed a small number of reporters, including me, to review an estimated 1,500 pages of his medical records without photocopying or recording the information.

In doing so, Mr. McCain gave the public its broadest look at the psychological profile of a presidential candidate. He released psychological records about him that were amassed as part of a Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war. Assessments were based on standard psychological tests and what Mr. McCain told his doctors after his release. The records mentioned that in 1968, about eight months after his capture and after some particularly brutal beatings from his North Vietnamese captors, Mr. McCain attempted suicide, trying to hang himself with his shirt.

The records and his doctors, whom I interviewed with the senator’s permission in 1999, said he had never been given a diagnosis of a mental health disorder or treated at the project’s center for a mental health disorder.

The records also showed that a surgeon removed a melanoma from Mr. McCain’s left shoulder in 1993. Melanomas can be a far more deadly form of skin cancer than the more common basal cell and other types.

In early August 2000, just as Mr. McCain’s rival George W. Bush was about to receive the Republican presidential nomination, Dr. John F. Eisold, the attending physician at the United States Capitol, detected two more melanomas, Mr. McCain’s second and third.

One on Mr. McCain’s left arm was determined to be the least risky type, in situ. But the one on his left temple was dangerous.

A few days after detection of the melanomas, Mr. McCain sought care for them at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale. Mr. McCain’s campaign said this year that the left-temple melanoma was 2.2 millimeters at its thickest part and graded as Stage IIA on a scale in which Stage IV is the worst. Stage II meant that the melanoma had not spread into the lymph nodes. The number of melanomas is less significant than the thickness measured in the pathology assessment of any one of them.

Mr. McCain underwent extensive surgery on his face and neck for the melanoma on Aug. 19, 2000. Surgeons removed more than 30 lymph nodes, and pathologists then determined that all of them were cancer free.

In March 2007, as Mr. McCain was making his second bid for the Republican nomination, The Times began asking his campaign for permission to speak with the senator and his doctors, citing the history of such interviews.

On May 6, 2008, Jill Hazelbaker, a McCain spokeswoman, denied the requests, writing in an e-mail message that The Times was “not at the top of the list” and including a link to a Times editorial that had criticized Mr. McCain for not disclosing health information and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York for not disclosing financial records.

On May 23, Mr. McCain allowed a small pool of journalists, including three doctor-reporters, though none from The Times, to spend three hours reviewing a newer set of his Mayo Clinic records. That set, 1,173 pages, included records from 2000 to 2008 but none of the records made available in 1999. Again, the campaign did not allow the journalists to photocopy any documents.

Mr. McCain’s Mayo Clinic doctors answered selected reporters’ questions by telephone, but only for 45 minutes instead of the scheduled two hours. The McCain campaign did not allow New York Times reporters to ask questions in the teleconference.

The clinic doctors said that Mr. McCain was in good health and that no medical reason precluded him from fulfilling all the duties of president.

The doctors said that a fourth melanoma they detected on the left side of his nose in 2002 was also in situ, the least dangerous type. All four melanomas that Mr. McCain experienced were primary, or new, and there was no evidence that any of them had spread, the doctors said.

However, the reporters’ summary cited a report dated Aug. 9, 2000, from two pathologists at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington who examined a biopsy of the melanoma taken from Mr. McCain’s left temple a few days earlier.

The Armed Forces pathologists suggested that the left-temple melanoma had spread from another melanoma, known as a metastasis or satellite lesion. “The vertical orientation of this lesion,” the report said, “with only focal epidermal involvement above it is highly suggestive of a metastasis of malignant melanoma and may represent a satellite metastasis of S00-9572-A,” which is the “skin, left temple, lateral” biopsy.

The pool report was by nature unable to provide a complete portrait of Mr. McCain’s recent medical history. It left several questions, including about the number of biopsies and when they were done. On Aug. 18, 2000, Dr. John D. Eckstein, Mr. McCain’s personal physician at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, noted in Mr. McCain’s records that there were two biopsies of the left temple. Dr. Eckstein’s note did not say where and when the biopsies were performed. The Armed Forces report cited one biopsy, so presumably a second was performed in Scottsdale. The Armed Forces pathologists said a melanoma had developed over a skin scar whose origin was unclear.

A skin lesion, not one of the four melanomas, had been removed from Mr. McCain’s left temple in 1996 and interpreted as being benign; some experts have speculated that it might have been misdiagnosed, and thus the origin of the 2000 melanoma.

The Armed Forces pathologists did not speak in the teleconference in May 2008, and questions raised by their report have remained unanswered. The selected reporters did not ask about that report, and the Mayo Clinic doctors did not discuss it. A complete Mayo pathology report was apparently not included in the pool summary.

In interviews, several melanoma experts questioned why the Mayo Clinic doctors had performed such extensive surgery, because the operation was usually reserved for treatment of Stage III melanoma, not Stage IIA.

On Aug. 18, 2000, the day before Mr. McCain’s operation, his surgeon, Dr. Michael L. Hinni, wrote in the records that he planned to do the extensive operation because of the size and location of Mr. McCain’s melanoma. In the teleconference in May 2008, Dr. Hinni explained that because the melanoma was two centimeters across he had to make “a 6-by-6-centimeter island of skin, a fairly sizable wound” to remove it.

It is not known whether the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale asked pathologists outside the Mayo system for an independent review.

If Mr. McCain’s 2000 left-temple melanoma was a metastasis, as the Armed Forces pathologists’ report suggested, it would be classified as Stage III. The reclassification would change his statistical odds for survival at 10 years from about 60 percent to 36 percent, according to a published study.

The greatest risk of recurrence of melanoma is in the first few years after detection. His age, his sex and the presence of the melanoma on his face increase the risk.

The fact that Mr. McCain has had no recurrence for eight years is in his favor. But cancer experts see the 10th anniversary as an important statistical benchmark, and that would not occur until 2010.

In May, his dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Suzanne M. Connolly, said in the teleconference that though there was no way to predict with certainty Mr. McCain’s chance of a recurrence, she judged it to be less than 10 percent. But melanoma is known to be quirkier than most cancers; doctors cite occasional cases in which melanomas come back after 15 or 20 years.

Melanomas can spread to various areas in the body, including the skin and any internal organ. In general, such spreading means the melanoma would not be curable. Treatment would depend in part on what organ or tissues are involved and could include additional surgery, chemotherapy, biologics, vaccines and radiation.

Many such treatments can be debilitating and impair an individual’s physical and mental stamina. If the patient was the president, the location of a recurrence and its treatment could raise the need to invoke the 25th Amendment, elevating the vice president to president, at least temporarily.

On the trail, Mr. McCain has played down concerns about his age by pointing to the vigor of his mother and her twin sister at age 96. Mr. McCain’s father died in 1981 at age 70 after a heart attack.

In the May teleconference, Dr. Eckstein said that he had not detected any memory deficits in Mr. McCain and that the senator had not reported any. Dr. Eckstein did not report whether Mr. McCain had taken any baseline cognitive tests.

Mr. McCain has kidney stones and takes a statin for high cholesterol but has no evidence of significant heart disease, his doctors said.

In making his medical information public, Mr. McCain released his confidentiality in the traditional patient-doctor relationship.

For its part, the Mayo Clinic says it agreed to yield control over all of Mr. McCain’s medical information to his campaign and to refer all questions to the campaign. Pool reporters inspected the records at a hotel near the clinic, which sent the records there under security. In the teleconference, the doctors answered questions by telephone at the clinic with no reporters present.

Dr. Eckstein, Mr. McCain’s doctor, said he understood that the campaign had released all the McCain records to the pool reporters. But a spokeswoman at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, asked if the institution could verify that the campaign had released all the records to the reporters, said she did not know whether the doctors had checked to be sure.

Last week, The Times contacted the McCain campaign to fill in gaps in the medical records. Ms. Hazelbaker, the McCain spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message: “As you know, we disclosed over 1,200 pages of Senator McCain’s medical history to Dr. Altman’s colleagues in the press earlier this year. We also arranged a Mayo Clinic briefing with three of Senator McCain’s physicians that Dr. Altman listened to by phone. Additionally, we released a detailed document outlining his most recent physical and lab test results. It was an unprecedented level of disclosure, and Dr. Altman can look at the public document on our Web site if he wishes to do so. It was certainly more significant than the one-page doctor’s note Obama released, though I have little hope The Times will report it that way.”

Barack Obama

On May 29, six days after the McCain campaign’s disclosures about his recent health, Mr. Obama’s campaign released an undated, single-page letter from his doctor in Chicago attesting to Mr. Obama’s “excellent health.”

The six-paragraph letter from Dr. David L. Scheiner said Mr. Obama had no known medical problems that would affect his ability to serve as president. Until the release of test results last week, the letter was the only information that Mr. Obama had made public about his health.

Dr. Scheiner’s assessment was based on regularly examining Mr. Obama since March 23, 1987. Mr. Obama’s last checkup was on Jan. 15, 2007, a day before he created a presidential exploratory committee and more than a year before his campaign released the letter from Dr. Scheiner, a general internist who practices at the University of Chicago Hospitals and the Rush University Medical Center.

The letter was short, the Obama campaign said, because Mr. Obama had not had any serious health problems. The campaign declined to make Dr. Scheiner available for an interview.

Mr. Obama has had a notable medical problem: a difficulty in stopping smoking. It is not known how heavily he smoked. Dr. Scheiner wrote that Mr. Obama began smoking at least two decades ago and had made several efforts to stop. Mr. Obama has used Nicorette gum “with success,” Dr. Scheiner wrote, without defining success.

Nicorette, which contains smaller amounts of nicotine than cigarettes do, is a replacement therapy intended to ease the craving for nicotine and other withdrawal effects of cigarette smoking.

Dr. Scheiner did not say when Mr. Obama had started using Nicorette, how much he had used or for how long he had used it. Reporters have often observed him chewing it.

Mr. Obama said he quit smoking in 2007 when he began his presidential campaign. But he has “bummed” cigarettes since then, he has said.

Also, Dr. Scheiner did not provide a standard measure of smoking risk. It is known as pack years — the number of packs smoked a day multiplied by the number of years a person has smoked. The pack-year number is used to help determine a patient’s risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease and other tobacco-related ailments.

Information about Mr. Obama’s smoking is relevant because studies show that the risk of cancer and other tobacco-related serious diseases declines after an individual stops smoking, but not until then.

According to the newly released documents, in January 2007 Mr. Obama had a total cholesterol level of 173 (HDL 68 and LDL 96) and triglycerides of 44. Those levels were normal.

Sarah Palin

Nothing is known publicly about Ms. Palin’s medical history, aside from the much-discussed circumstances surrounding the birth of her fifth child last April. Ms. Palin has said that her water broke while she was at a conference in Dallas and that she flew to Alaska where she gave birth to her son Trig hours after landing.

Last week Maria Comella, a spokeswoman for Ms. Palin, said the governor declined to be interviewed or provide any health records.

Joseph R. Biden Jr.

In 1988, Mr. Biden was working out on a shoulder press weight machine in the Senate gym when a pain shot through his neck. On the train home to Wilmington, Del., the neck pain returned more severely. His head ached. The right side of his body went numb. A doctor later diagnosed a pinched nerve, and a pain clinic prescribed a neck brace.

Shortly thereafter, on a trip to Rochester, Mr. Biden was alone in his hotel room when he felt a sharp stab in the back of his neck and a lightning flash in his head. The rip of pain was like none he had ever experienced. Nothing Mr. Biden did, including curling up in the fetal position, relieved the pain. He lay unconscious on the floor for five hours, he wrote in his autobiography, “Promises to Keep” (Random House, 2007).

The next morning, he felt somewhat better and flew home. His wife, Jill, summoned from the school where she taught, immediately took him to a hospital. Doctors determined he had a berry-shaped bulge in an artery that was leaking blood into his brain. Such bulges, or aneurysms, can tear at any time. Ruptured aneurysms are fatal in about 50 percent of cases. Up to 20 percent of survivors remain severely disabled. A Roman Catholic priest gave Mr. Biden last rites.

After a harrowing ambulance trip to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, a team of neurosurgeons put a clip on the artery to stop the bleeding. While recuperating, he suffered a major complication: a blood clot lodged in his lung.

A few weeks later, surgeons operated on a second aneurysm on the opposite side of his brain. Though it had caused no symptoms, it still could have burst as the first one did.

Mr. Biden returned to the Senate after a seven-month absence.

Now, a question arises: Has Mr. Biden developed a new aneurysm over the last two decades that could burst?

Doctors, who long thought that berry aneurysms were a once-in-a-lifetime event, now generally believe that they can recur. About 5 percent or less of patients who have had a berry aneurysm develop new ones at the original site or elsewhere in the brain.

“Over the last two decades,” said Dr. Robert F. Spetzler of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, “we have learned much more about aneurysms, and the fact is that when you have had one aneurysm, you are more likely to develop another one. Although the likelihood is very low, it does exist.”

Doctors’ views vary widely on what types of brain imaging tests to recommend to patients who have had a berry aneurysm and when to do them. Some conduct no tests. Others periodically conduct tests like magnetic resonance angiograms.

Mr. Biden has “recovered fully without continued effects” from the aneurysm, Dr. Eisold, the Capitol physician, said in a letter released by the campaign. Dr. Eisold, a specialist in internal medicine, has a longstanding policy not to talk to reporters about his patients, even with their permission.

The Obama-Biden campaign referred me to Dr. Matthew A. Parker, an internist in Washington, who reviewed Mr. Biden’s records and also spoke with Dr. Eisold about them. Dr. Parker said that Dr. Eisold told him that brain imaging tests were not needed now because Mr. Biden had done well for the 20 years after the aneurysm. “It is a nonissue,” Dr. Parker said Dr. Eisold told him.

Dr. Parker, who is associated with George Washington University Hospital and Sibley Memorial Hospital, said he had not treated or met with Mr. Biden and did not have a direct connection to the campaign. Federal Election Commission records show that Dr. Parker contributed the maximum, $2,300, to Mr. Obama’s presidential campaign on March 13, 2008.

The medical records released by the campaign contain a summary of Mr. Biden’s operation and hospital stay in 1988 but no notes from a neurologist or neurosurgeon since then. So it is not known whether Mr. Biden has had recent brain imaging scans or has been evaluated by a neurologist or neurosurgeon recently. Dr. Parker said he did not ask Dr. Eisold when a neurologist or neurosurgeon last examined Mr. Biden.

Four leading neurosurgeons interviewed separately in this country and Europe said that as a vice-presidential nominee, Mr. Biden should have had recent brain imaging studies to detect any new aneurysm, because if one is found he might face more neurosurgery and be out of work for weeks or longer.

“What would I do in this situation?” said Dr. Eugene S. Flamm, the chairman of the department of neurological surgery at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. “I would say, get an M.R.A. and check. You can’t just play the statistics.”

Doctors caring for political leaders and other prominent people often face difficulty in ordering tests that might clarify a situation for such patients but that are not recommended for all patients.

Dr. Parker said, “Some people will say, well, given the high-profile nature of the situation, we should do the test to be sure.” But, he added, “that is not necessarily wise.”

Among the reasons is a desire to avoid anxiety among patients and because doctors may not know what to do about an equivocal finding.

Dr. Parker said that even when he “pressed Dr. Eisold on the very same thing, given the circumstances” with Mr. Biden, Dr. Eisold “was very definitive about” not doing brain scan tests now.

The question of an aneurysm aside, the documents show Mr. Biden to have relatively minor health problems, including chronic sinusitis and allergies. He has an enlarged prostate, but a biopsy showed no evidence of cancer. With the help of a statin, he has normal cholesterol levels: 173 (HDL 47 and LDL 98) and triglycerides of 133.

In Summary

All in all, the gaps and paucity of information leave the electorate with insufficient information to fully judge the health of the nominees. The information that has been released is a retreat from the approach that most campaigns took over the last 10 elections.

In an earlier time, there was a kind of gentlemen’s agreement between officials and the news media that permitted serious health conditions to be played down or kept secret.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was crippled by polio more than a decade before he became president and, by his fourth term, he had developed serious heart disease, but the public was largely shielded from the profound effects. And while much was made of John F. Kennedy’s bad back and the rocking chair that gave him relief, it was only in the years after his assassination that his case of Addison’s disease, a hormonal disorder, became widely known.

What might be called the modern era of disclosure arguably began in 1972, when Mr. Eagleton had to step down as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee because he had not informed his running mate, Senator George McGovern, of his history of depression.

In 1992, Mr. Tsongas, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for president, spoke to me to assure the public that he was free of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, after a bone marrow transplant in 1986. In interviews, his doctors at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute backed his assertion that he was cancer free. But in fact the cancer had recurred, and Mr. Tsongas eventually withdrew from the race. He died two days before his first term would have ended.

Other candidates who made themselves and their doctors available include the elder George Bush, Bob Dole, Al Gore and John Kerry. A leading example of openness was Ronald Reagan, whose age, 69, had become an issue in the 1980 election. Mr. Reagan authorized his doctors to be interviewed. He also agreed to an interview himself, against the wishes of his aides, answering all my questions, including what would he do if he became senile as president.

“Resign,” he said."

The presidency is a physically demanding, hugely stressful job. There is no excuse for both candidates’ failure to fully disclose medical records that clearly bear on their ability to do that job.

The big gaps in what the nominees have been willing to make public were described in The Times on Monday by Lawrence K. Altman, a medical reporter who is also a physician. Senator John McCain has put out far more information than his rival, but under such restricted conditions that it is impossible to nail down the truth about his past melanomas, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Senator Barack Obama has put out such meager information that voters have to take it largely on his campaign’s say-so that he is in good health.

Senator McCain allowed a small pool of reporters to review 1,200 pages of medical records during a three-hour period and then allowed a few of his doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona to answer questions by telephone for 45 minutes. The reporters were not allowed to photocopy any documents, making it harder for them to ask other experts what the medical findings might imply.

The most critical questions raised by the McCain documents concern his four melanomas. The records show that Army pathologists would have classified one of his melanomas as more severe than his own doctors did. Mr. McCain has survived for eight years since that melanoma was removed, but some cancer experts won’t breathe easily until 10 years have passed.

In contrast to Senator McCain’s voluminous records, Senator Obama issued an undated, single-page letter from his personal doctor asserting that he is in “excellent health” and that there are no known medical problems that would affect his ability to serve as president. The Obama campaign has refused to make the doctor available for interviews."

No woman is immune, and taking early action can make all the difference.

Choosing Not to Wait

Kerry Herman of Brooklyn took the opposite path from the reader above, and it clearly paid off.

Knowing that her mother had breast cancer at age 49, she had her first mammogram at 38, just before her first full-term pregnancy. She was told her breasts were cystic and very dense but otherwise healthy. When Ms. Herman stopped nursing her daughter, she had a second mammogram, at 41, then annually thereafter.

Ms. Herman was in her early 50s when the mammograms started to show calcifications. By then sonograms were readily available to supplement her breast exams. At age 55 her annual mammogram revealed a different pattern of calcifications in her left breast. Though the radiologist and surgeon told her they did not think this was worrisome, a biopsy was recommended and done in three locations. It revealed very early cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, or D.C.I.S.

Faced with removal of the left breast and biopsies of the right, Ms. Herman said in an interview: “I decided to be more proactive. After consulting my husband, who said he was more concerned about my health than my breasts, I had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction.”

“I have never regretted my decision,” she said. “For me, having to go through this every year and wondering if I would beat the Grim Reaper was agony.”

A friend of hers with the same findings chose to wait and see, Ms. Herman said. She ended up with an invasive cancer that had spread beyond the breast by the time of her next exam.

What’s Normal, What’s Not

Many women have symptoms of breast disease, but few have cancer, as an educational article in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine in 2002 noted.

“Yet these symptoms are understandably a source of great concern for women,” said the article, titled “Benign Breast Disease: When to Treat, When to Reassure, and When to Refer.” “The challenge for physicians is to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions, and to know when prompt referral to a surgeon or other specialist is necessary.”

The article explained that during their reproductive years, just before menstruating, many women experience swelling and tenderness in their breasts, and some develop lumpiness and pain, all of which goes away after their periods. This is normal and not a cause for concern.

But if lumpiness or thickening occurs in only one breast and persists between periods, further examination by mammography (or if a woman is under 35, by sonography) and referral to a breast specialist for a possible biopsy is needed.

Women are told that breast pain is not a symptom of cancer. But if pain occurs in only one breast in a specific area and, in a premenopausal woman, does not subside after her period ends, a mammogram, sonogram and visit to a breast specialist are in order.

A decade ago, this course of action saved my left breast and perhaps my life. My mammogram was negative but a sonogram of the area that hurt was not, and while I could feel no lump, a biopsy revealed an early cancer treatable with lumpectomy and radiation.

Breast lumps are common, and most are benign. But those that are firm with irregular borders and attached firmly to the skin or soft tissue are more likely to be malignant. Even if a mammogram is negative in such cases, a biopsy is needed since about 15 percent of cancers are missed by mammography.

Ms. Herman and I both benefited from the fact that we saw the same radiologists year after year, doctors who knew our breast history and had records of previous exams available for comparison. If you go to a new mammographer, bring your earlier films.

Understanding Calcifications

Calcium deposits in the breast are common, especially after menopause, and can result from several noncancerous causes: calcium in the fluid of a benign cyst; a result of inflammation in or injury to the breast; prior breast radiation; calcium deposits in a dilated milk duct or an artery; dermatitis, or a residue of powders, ointments or deodorant (which is why you are told not to use deodorant on the day of your mammogram).

They do not, however, come from calcium in the diet or calcium lost from bones. But tattoo pigments on the breast can produce a misleading picture of calcifications.

Breast calcifications come in two forms. Large, or coarse, calcifications appear as single white dots on a mammogram. They are most common and nearly always benign. Smaller ones, called microcalcifications, look like tiny white specks. If they are scattered, they bear watching but are also usually benign.

When microcalcifications are numerous and clustered, further testing is needed. The radiologist may call for a magnification mammogram and, even if no lump is apparent, a needle biopsy or stereotactic core biopsy of the suspicious area. If instead of a biopsy you are told to return in six months or a year for another mammogram, you’d be wise to seek a second opinion."

Our health care system needs a similar revolution.,"Look at what’s happened in baseball. For decades, executives, managers and scouts built their teams and managed games based on their personal experiences and a handful of dubious statistics. This romantic approach has been replaced with a statistics-based creed called sabermetrics.

These are not the stats we studied as children on the backs of baseball cards. Sabermetrics relies on obscure statistics like WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched), VORP (value over replacement player) or runs created — a number derived from the formula [(hits + walks) x total bases]/(at bats + walks). Franchises have used this data to answer some of the key questions in baseball: When is an attempted steal worth the risk? Whom should we draft, and in what order? Should we re-sign an aging star player and run the risk of paying for past performance rather than future results?

Similarly, a health care system that is driven by robust comparative clinical evidence will save lives and money. One success story is Cochrane Collaboration, a nonprofit group that evaluates medical research. Cochrane performs systematic, evidence-based reviews of medical literature. In 1992, a Cochrane review found that many women at risk of premature delivery were not getting corticosteroids, which improve the lung function of premature babies.

Based on this evidence, the use of corticosteroids tripled. The result? A nearly 10 percentage point drop in the deaths of low-birth-weight babies and millions of dollars in savings by avoiding the costs of treating complications.

Another example is Intermountain Healthcare, a nonprofit health-care system in Utah, where 80 percent of the care is based on evidence. Treatment data is collected by electronic medical records. The data is analyzed by researchers, and the best practices are then incorporated into the clinical process, resulting in far better quality care at a cost that is one-third less than the national average. (Disclosure: Intermountain Healthcare is a member of Mr. Gingrich’s organization.)

Evidence-based health care would not strip doctors of their decision-making authority nor replace their expertise. Instead, data and evidence should complement a lifetime of experience, so that doctors can deliver the best quality care at the lowest possible cost.

Working closely with doctors, the federal government and the private sector should create a new institute for evidence-based medicine. This institute would conduct new studies and systematically review the existing medical literature to help inform our nation’s over-stretched medical providers. The government should also increase Medicare reimbursements and some liability protections for doctors who follow the recommended clinical best practices.

America’s health care system behaves like a hidebound, tradition-based ball club that chases after aging sluggers and plays by the old rules: we pay too much and get too little in return. To deliver better health care, we should learn from the successful teams that have adopted baseball’s new evidence-based methods. The best way to start improving quality and lowering costs is to study the stats."

It is likely to erode employer-provided group health insurance and push more people into purchasing their own insurance on the dysfunctional open market, where insurers often reject applicants with pre-existing conditions.

Mr. Obama has focused primarily on extending coverage to a big chunk of the 45 million uninsured Americans by expanding existing private and public programs with the help of federal subsidies and mandates. His boldest innovation would be a new federally regulated exchange where Americans not covered at work would be able to choose — as federal employees currently can — among a variety of private group policies. He would also create a new public program to compete with the private insurers.

Mr. Obama’s plan is a better start than Mr. McCain’s. But it is still not likely to help all Americans who need and deserve affordable, high-quality medical care.

As voters weigh their choice for next Tuesday’s election, we offer this detailed review of the two candidates’ plans.

THE MCCAIN PROPOSAL Mr. McCain’s main idea is to change the tax code so that workers would have to pay income taxes on the value of their employer’s contribution to their health insurance. In return, all Americans, whether currently insured or not, would receive a tax credit of $2,500 for an individual or $5,000 for a family to buy health insurance, either through their employer or on the open market.

Mr. Obama has derided this plan as giving tax credits with one hand and taking them away with the other. But the tax credits are initially so generous that a great majority of workers would end up ahead: their tax credit would exceed the tax they would have to pay on their employer-provided insurance.

They could stay in the same health plan at work and have extra money that could be applied to other health care costs. Or they could buy policies in the open market. As good as that sounds, a $5,000 credit would not go very far toward buying a typical $12,000 family policy but might well suffice for the young and healthy, who get preferable rates.

Mr. McCain correctly recognizes that there are disadvantages to linking insurance to jobs — as thousands of laid-off American workers already are discovering — and that there is an intrinsic inequity in the current tax code that favors those who have employer plans over those buying individual coverage.

The great danger is that Mr. McCain’s plan will fragment the sharing of risks and costs — the bedrock of any good insurance plan — by enticing young, healthy workers to bail out of their employers’ group policies to seek cheaper insurance on their own. Their older or less healthy colleagues would be left behind, which would drive up premiums at work. The rising costs could lead many companies to drop their health coverage entirely.

The proposal also offers little protection for older and sicker people forced to buy policies in the open market. Mr. McCain says the federal government would help underwrite high-risk pools like those operated by many states to cover such patients. But the subsidies his aides have talked about — some $7 billion to $10 billion a year — would fall far short of the amount needed.

Mr. McCain would loosen state regulations on insurers by allowing companies to sell across state lines. Some states require insurers to accept all applicants and provide specified standard benefits, and they limit the ability of companies to base premiums on health status. In the name of promoting competition, Mr. McCain’s plan would free companies from those terms. Anyone who lost insurance as a result would have to seek coverage through the high-risk pools.

THE OBAMA PLAN Mr. Obama would do far more than his opponent to address the nation’s shameful failure to provide health coverage for all citizens. He would require all parents to get coverage for their children and expand Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. He would also require large and midsize companies to offer health insurance to their workers or pay into a kitty to subsidize coverage elsewhere — a provision that Senator McCain castigates as a “fine” but that really is their fair share of the burden.

Mr. Obama says the government would provide subsidies to encourage small employers to offer coverage and to help low-income people buy insurance. This is not a government-run program — as Mr. McCain claims — but it does give the government a much bigger role than it now has by expanding public programs and creating a new national plan.

Mr. Obama would also greatly increase government regulation of the insurance industry. He would require insurance companies to take every applicant and meet a minimum standard of benefits, and he would prevent them from charging higher premiums based on an applicant’s health. Some states have similar requirements now and insurance companies still sell policies there.

COVERAGE Some experts estimate that the McCain plan would reduce the number of uninsured only modestly because millions of people would drop or lose employer coverage, and not many more than that would buy policies outside of work. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the McCain plan would lower the number of uninsured by a mere two million in 2018, out of a projected 67 million uninsured in that year. The Obama plan would cut the number by 34 million, the center says, but still leave nearly 33 million uninsured.

The McCain campaign makes an optimistic prediction that up to 30 million of the uninsured might take out policies using their tax credits. If so, those policies would probably be meager — with high deductibles, large co-payments and limited benefits — and unlikely to provide much help in a crisis.

COSTS Despite all the Republican warnings about high-spending Democrats, McCain’s plan could be a lot more expensive than Mr. Obama’s, at least in the early years, and possibly in the long term. This is because the generous tax credits would drain federal revenues faster than the tax on employer policies would replenish them.

The Tax Policy Center estimates that the McCain plan would cost the federal government $1.3 trillion over 10 years, and the Obama plan $1.6 trillion. Using different assumptions, the Lewin Group, a consulting firm, estimates that the McCain plan would increase federal spending by $2.05 trillion over 10 years, compared with $1.17 trillion for the Obama package.

Neither candidate has persuasively explained how he would pay for his plan. Mr. Obama says he would apply the money saved by rescinding Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy and hoped-for savings from reforming the health care system, but there is considerable doubt those savings will materialize quickly.

Mr. McCain also counts on cost-containment measures but is mostly relying on market forces to reduce the cost of health insurance and health care. He expects that people who buy their own coverage will shop for cheaper policies and make more careful choices about what medical care they really need. Among the dangers is that chronically ill people may forgo needed treatments.

Mr. Obama’s plan is the better one because it would cover far more of the uninsured, spread risks and costs more equitably and result in more comprehensive coverage for most Americans. We fear Mr. McCain’s plan would jeopardize employer-based coverage without providing an adequate substitute. At a time when so many employers are reducing or dropping coverage, that is not a risk that the country can afford to take."

Barack Obama placed a heavy bet last week that they can recover together.,"With that sense of the battle-scarred history of health care politics, Mr. Obama began a careful campaign to frame the issue more as a pocketbook concern than a moral one. Given that four of five Americans are dissatisfied with health costs, while only 15 percent lack insurance, strategists have argued since the Clinton health care debacle of the 1990s that success would depend on persuading the vast middle of its economic self-interest.

It was no accident that Mr. Obama emphasized that reducing costs would be “the starting point” of his efforts.

With health insurance premiums rising this decade at four times the rate of inflation, and draining a growing share of personal income, middle-class support for an overhaul would seem to be reaching critical mass. If a broad swath of Americans feel destabilized enough by health costs, their demands for relief could help marginalize the kind of opposition from entrenched interests that has killed previous efforts.

“Most Americans are troubled by the lack of universal insurance, but what really frightens them is the prospect that their own insurance won’t protect their health or family finances,” said Jacob S. Hacker, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley and an authority on health care. “That’s a fear that more and more Americans are facing as health costs skyrocket and job security plummets.”

Mr. Obama seems to recognize that the recession, with its devastating job losses, affords him the potential to accelerate public opinion. To broaden support for his plan — whatever it ends up being — he insisted last week that systematic improvements in health care would be essential to any lasting economic recovery.

“It’s not something that we can sort of put off because we’re in an emergency,” he said. “This is part of the emergency.”

Mr. Obama said his health plan would be “intimately woven into” his administration’s economic blueprint. And he directly confronted those who might ask how the country could afford a major expansion of health coverage in times of shrinking revenues and burgeoning deficits. “I ask a different question,” Mr. Obama said. “I ask how can we afford not to?”

Indeed, the economic consequences of the system’s inadequacies have come into stark relief with the economy’s deterioration. Rarely have they been felt so directly by such a broad spectrum of people.

Researchers at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families estimate that 4.1 million people lost their employer-sponsored insurance over the last year, and that two million of them remain uninsured. Across the country, the chronically ill report they are deferring care and splitting pills because they can no longer afford out-of-pocket costs.

Employers are being pushed to the brink, from general stores to General Motors, which reportedly spends more per car on health care than on steel. States are facing unsustainable increases in demand for public insurance programs and are cutting benefits, eligibility levels and provider payments in order to balance budgets.

“The case for action has been compelling for a long time, but getting our political system to act requires a widespread sense of crisis and broad resolve among political leaders,” Mr. Hacker said. “In fostering that sense of crisis and that resolve, the current severe downturn has been hugely important.”

There has been pressure from Congressional Democrats for Mr. Obama to stand strong on health care, with influential committee chairmen like Senators Max Baucus of Montana and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts making it an unwavering priority. They are ready to take up legislation early next year, a task made easier by Mr. Obama’s plea for immediate action and by tentative encouragement from business, labor and provider groups.

Those interested parties may retreat once details make clear whose ox will be gored. Well-financed health insurers and business groups waged a brutally successful campaign against the Clinton health care plan, and doctors and hospitals have done much the same in state legislatures.

There is a rough consensus, certainly among the Democrats who control both houses, around many key components of the Obama plan — to expand government subsidization of insurance for the poor, to stimulate competition through a new government plan, to require insurers to accept those with pre-existing medical problems and to invest in computerization, prevention and payment incentives for better care.

Less certain, of course, is how to pay for it. During the campaign, Mr. Obama said he would get about half of the necessary total, estimated at more than $100 billion a year, by raising taxes on those making more than $250,000. The rest was to come from savings generated by various efficiencies (their value is a matter of considerable dispute).

Mr. Obama reaffirmed on Thursday that his proposal to roll back the Bush tax cuts might be deferred because of the recession. “We’re probably going to have to, then, find additional dollars to pay for some investments in the short term,” he said, adding that he wants his health plan to pay for itself over a decade.

Some of those dollars may be found by packaging health care initiatives as stimulus measures, a recessionary opportunity presented by the public’s acceptance of deficit spending to spur the economy. What, after all, is $100 billion for health coverage if the government can print $700 billion to bail out the banks?

The Obama transition and leaders in Congress are negotiating a massive stimulus package that could include $40 billion in health care spending over two years. Among the likely beneficiaries would be state Medicaid programs and computerized health records, both of which Mr. Obama had vowed to expand long before the recession.

Jonathan B. Oberlander, who teaches health politics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said recessionary pressures had raised the chances for change from nil to possible. The question, he said, is whether Mr. Obama and Mr. Daschle can harness the new urgency and marginalize the opposition that will inevitably emerge.

“The history of health reform is replete with instances of reformers believing this time it’s inevitable,” Mr. Oberlander said. “Those prior tipping points all turned out to be mirages.”"

But the more I read, the more I realized that there was a correlation between good grades and attentiveness. Reviewers gave less-than-passing, and even failing, grades to those physicians who seemed rushed, brusque or distracted; and they uniformly gave “A’s” and “B’s” to doctors who were warm, concerned and focused.

Even more could be gleaned from what went unsaid. Amongst the many comments I read, I found almost no mention of a doctor’s actual medical skill.

That was not the case with roofers, for example, where in addition to grades, reviewers’ comments offered great specifics — and even photographs — regarding the quality of the handiwork, the types of supplies used and the aesthetics of the finished product. All the detailed commentaries fleshed out each company’s final grades, and it was easy to get a pretty good sense of an individual roofer’s skill and craftsmanship.

With doctors, however, there were no detailed descriptions of medical skill beyond the overall grade. Instead, the playing field seemed oddly level. One surgeon, it appeared, could operate much like another; pediatricians and internists could diagnose and manage with similar abilities; and obstetricians could deliver babies regardless of shape, size, or form. All doctors, whatever their grades, seemed to possess similar and interchangeable skills that they could then apply to you. You just might not like the way they treated you in the process.

I found this extraordinary degree of trust astonishing. When I look for a doctor, of course I am concerned about how that doctor relates to me as a patient. But there are a whole host of other issues I consider as well, such as the physician’s training, board certification, experience, membership in a respected professional society, safety records and hospital affiliations. And I admit that I don’t feel comfortable as a patient in another doctor’s hands until I learn the answers to at least some of my questions.

But as it turns out, most patients don’t feel the same way. And many of them are just as trusting when it comes to treatment specifics.

Earlier this year, the American College of Surgeons, the national scientific and educational organization of surgeons, conducted a nationwide survey that found that the average patient devotes an hour or less to researching his or her surgery or surgeon. While prospective patients worry about the costs or complications of an operation, they don’t necessarily look for information that would address their concerns.

In fact, more than a third of patients who had an operation in the last five years never reviewed the credentials of the surgeon who operated. Patients are more likely to spend time researching a job change (on average, about 10 hours) or a new car (8 hours) than the operation they are about to submit to or the surgeon who wields the knife. And many patients are satisfied with the answers they receive from their surgeon or primary care doctor, whoever those individuals happen to be.

I was intrigued by the survey, so I called Dr. Thomas Russell, executive director of the American College of Surgeons. “There is a tendency, probably more so now than in the era of Marcus Welby, for patients not to get particularly involved and not to feel compelled to look into their surgery or surgeons,” he told me.

There are consequences to that kind of blind trust. “Today, medicine and surgery are really team sports,” Dr. Russell continued, “and the patient, as the ultimate decision maker, is the most important member of the team. Mistakes can happen, and patients have to be educated and must understand what is going on.”

Dr. Russell has made it part of his personal mission to educate patients and recently wrote a book, “I Need an Operation...Now What? A Patient’s Guide to a Safe and Successful Outcome,” as a response to the survey. ”Patients and their families need to be armed with the fortitude and the right questions in order to find the best doctors for their problems,” he said.

In other words, a healthy doctor-patient relationship does not simply entail good bedside manners and responsible office management on the part of the doctor. It also requires that patients come to the relationship educated about their doctors, their illnesses and their treatment.

“If we are truly going to reform the health care system in the U.S.,” Dr. Russell said, “everybody has to participate actively and must educate themselves. That means doctors, nurses, other health care professionals, lawyers, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies. But most of all, it means the patient.”

Trust is important. But as Sir Francis Bacon, who was among the first to understand the importance of gathering data in science, once observed, knowledge is power.

Markey of Massachusetts and Pete Stark of California, both Democrats; Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.

Without strong safeguards, Mr. Markey said, the dream of electronic health information networks could turn into “a nightmare for consumers.”

In the last few years, personal health information on hundreds of thousands of people has been compromised because of security lapses at hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. These breaches occurred despite federal privacy rules issued under a 1996 law. Congress is trying to strengthen those privacy protections and make sure they apply to computer records. Lobbyists for insurers, drug benefit managers and others in the health industry are mobilizing a campaign to persuade Congress that overly stringent privacy protections would frustrate the potential benefits of digital records.

One of the proposed safeguards would outlaw the sale of any personal health information in an electronic medical record, except with the patient’s permission.

Another would allow patients to impose additional controls on certain particularly sensitive information, like records of psychotherapy, abortions and tests for the virus that causes AIDS. Patients could demand that such information be segregated from the rest of their medical records.

Under other proposals being seriously considered in Congress, health care providers and insurers would have to use encryption technology to protect personal health information stored in or sent by computers. Patients would have a right to an accounting of any disclosures of their electronic data. Health care providers and insurers would have to notify patients whenever such information was lost, stolen or used for an unauthorized purpose. And patients — or state officials acting on their behalf — could recover damages from an entity that improperly used or disclosed personal health information.

Rahm Emanuel, who will be the White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, advocated such safeguards when he was a House member from Illinois. “As we move forward on health information technology,” Mr. Emanuel said, “it is absolutely essential that an individual’s most personal and vulnerable information is protected.”

Advisers to Mr. Obama say he favors strong privacy protections but does not want the dispute to slow down the bill.

Mary R. Grealy, president of the Health Care Leadership Council, which represents large health care corporations, said the proposed safeguards could be an impediment to the widespread adoption of health information technology and counteract any economic stimulus effect.

In a letter to Congressional leaders, Karen M. Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, expressed “serious concern about privacy provisions being considered for inclusion in the economic stimulus bill.”

She criticized, in particular, a proposal that would require health care providers to obtain the consent of patients before disclosing personal health information for treatment, payment or “health care operations.”

Such a requirement, she said, could cripple efforts to manage chronic diseases like diabetes, which often require coordination of care among many specialists.

At the moment, senior House Democrats are determined to include privacy safeguards in the economic recovery bill. But some insurance lobbyists said they hoped Congress would punt on the issue, leaving privacy standards to be developed by the Health and Human Services Department, where they believe they can make their case more effectively. Microsoft has joined many consumer groups in supporting stronger safeguards. The software giant has developed products that allow consumers and providers to store and share medical data in a secure format.

“Health information technology will succeed only if privacy is protected,” said Frank C. Torres, director of consumer affairs at Microsoft. “For the president-elect to achieve his vision, he has to protect privacy.”

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Peter R. Orszag, director-designate of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said electronic medical records could be more secure than paper records.

“If the files are electronic,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “computers can record every time someone has access to your medical information.” But, he said, the challenge is political as well as technical.

“Until people are more confident about the security of electronic medical records,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “it’s vitally important that we err on the side of privacy.”

The data in medical records has great potential commercial value. Several companies, for example, buy and sell huge amounts of data on the prescribing habits of doctors, and the information has proved invaluable to pharmaceutical sales representatives.

“Health I.T. without privacy is an excellent way for companies to establish a gold mine of information that can be used to increase profits, promote expensive drugs, cherry-pick patients who are cheaper to insure and market directly to consumers,” said Dr. Deborah C. Peel, coordinator of the Coalition for Patient Privacy, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union among its members."

Re “Privacy Issue Complicates Push to Link Medical Data” (news article, Jan. 18):

Consumer groups and some members of Congress rightly express concern that President Obama’s plan to stimulate the use of information technology in health care presents challenges to individual privacy unless there are strong safeguards.

These security features are required for electronic health record products to be certified by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology.

Among the criteria for certification are the ability to restrict viewing privileges to some users or groups of users, and to identify certain information as confidential and limit the number of people who can see it.

But the standard for including any initiative in the economic recovery plan is that it be “timely, targeted and temporary,” while also creating jobs, Mr. Levin said recently in an address to the Congressional Internet Caucus, an advisory group. Not every investment in these technology fields, he said, fits those criteria.

The technology industry is not typically viewed as a prolific job producer. Much of its manufacturing is highly automated. But bringing technology to services fields like health care, telecommunications and energy can be labor intensive and thus generate jobs.

At the top of the jobs pyramid, the design of new technology is done by scientists and engineers with advanced degrees. The installing, tweaking and maintaining of that technology in specific industries involve a far broader base of workers with a range of training, skills and education.

“There is a huge implementation phase to the adoption and use of these kinds of technologies locally,” said John Irons, an economist and research director at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington. “The jobs involved do tend to span the spectrum of skills and income levels. And they are not going to be outsourced offshore.”

The job-generation estimate by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation translates into more than 30,000 jobs created for each $1 billion of government investment — roughly similar to projections for public works spending.

But proponents of spending on digital infrastructure say the beneficial spillover effects are greater than for conventional public works. The high-tech investments, they say, can be the contemporary equivalent of federal financing for highways in the 1950s, which fostered the growth of businesses like automakers and national retail chains.

For years, technology policy in the United States has focused mainly on broad measures like federal spending on basic research and tax credits for private investment in research and development. Mr. Obama has vowed to increase spending on basic research and make R.& D. tax credits permanent.

But the administration’s plan for large programs tailored to specific industries is a departure. How investments and incentives are structured, experts say, will be crucial to companies, consumers and taxpayers.

The danger of such an approach, some economists warn, is that industry-specific government programs can tilt markets to the advantage of some companies and disadvantage of others, putting Washington on the path of picking winners and losers.

The other criticism is that, while these projects may be worthy for the long term, they should not be part of a short-term economic recovery plan.

All three fields, said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford, involve “a bunch of specialists, where if we raised spending quickly, the limited number of competent suppliers would be in short supply and get increased incomes,” benefiting some companies more than the economy as a whole.

“We should not pour government money into these areas,” said Mr. Hall, who is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group.

The issues surrounding electronic health records illustrate the policy challenges of targeted programs. Mr. Obama has advocated spending $50 billion over five years to accelerate the use of such records and the sharing of health information across a national network.

The computerized records, when used properly, are an indispensable tool for measuring, tracking and improving patient care — yet only about 17 percent of the nation’s doctors are using them. They are commonplace at large medical groups, but 75 percent of doctors practice in small offices of 10 physicians or fewer.

Doctors often benefit from inefficiency, because the dominant fee-for-service payment system means they are paid for doing more — more doctor visits, tests, surgical procedures, pills.

“Paying to put computer hardware and software in physicians’ offices isn’t going to do anything unless you change the incentives in the system,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, former national health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration.

There are some experiments with a pay-for-performance approach, in which Medicare gives medical groups bonus payments for meeting certain benchmarks of quality care. Monitoring that performance requires electronic health records. Yet to date, these have been isolated tests.

“You want to pay for achievement — better health quality and efficiency,” said Dr. David Blumenthal, director of the Institute for Health Policy at the Harvard Medical School, who advised the Obama campaign. “But in the transition period, before financial incentives are reformed, you need to provide incentives or grants to use electronic health records because this technology is sort of the opening wedge to reform.”

Those eligible for grants to buy technology, a member of the Obama transition team said, will include inner-city and rural hospitals and small doctor practices. But most money, he said, will go to incentive payments to improve quality and safety of care.

Still, creating effective programs to accelerate the use of health information to improve care will be difficult. And the move toward a national health information network, where patient data is more widely shared among providers and insurers, must include strong safeguards to address concerns about the privacy of personal health information, if Congress is to approve the proposed financing.

Some health experts say a shortage of skilled people is a bottleneck in any rapid push toward electronic records.

In suburban Philadelphia, Greg Beese is head of the Logic Group, a 15-person technology support firm, whose clients include 15 doctors’ offices. He says he looks forward to an acceleration of the use of electronic health records. A person with solid technology skills, he said, can master the health care knowledge in a couple of months on the job. “It’s not like we’d have to send them back to school for two years.”"

The goal is both to improve the quality and lower the costs of care by replacing cumbersome paper records with electronic records that can be easily stored and swiftly transmitted.

The idea is sound, but it also raises important questions about how to ensure the privacy of patients. Fortunately, the legislation would impose sensible privacy protections despite attempts by business lobbyists to weaken the safeguards.

With paper records the opportunities for breaches are limited to over-the-shoulder glimpses or the occasional lost or stolen files. But when records are kept and transferred electronically, the potential for abuse can become as vast as the Internet.

Electronic health records that can be linked to individual patients are already protected by laws that apply primarily to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacists, laboratories and insurance plans. The stimulus bill that has passed in the House, and a similar bill awaiting approval in the Senate, would strengthen the privacy requirements and apply them more directly to “business associates” of the providers, like billing and collection services or pharmacy benefit managers, that have access to sensitive data but are not readily held accountable for any misuse.

The potential for harm was spelled out by the American Civil Liberties Union in a recent letter to Congress. Employers who obtain medical records inappropriately might reject a job candidate who looks expensive to insure. Drug companies with access to pharmaceutical records might try to pressure patients to switch to their products. Data brokers might buy medical and pharmaceutical records and sell them to marketers. Unscrupulous employees with access to electronic records might snoop on the health of their colleagues or neighbors.

The bills pending in Congress would go a long way toward preventing such abuses. They would outlaw the sale of any personal health information without the patient’s permission, mandate audit trails to help detect inappropriate access, and require that patients be notified whenever their records are lost or used for an unauthorized purpose. They would also beef up the penalties for noncompliance and allow state attorneys general to help enforce the rules — a useful backup in case the federal government falls down on the job. The House version would also encourage the use of protective technologies, like encryption, to protect personal medical information that will be transmitted.

Health insurance plans and some disease management groups are complaining that the new requirements would impose administrative burdens that could actually impede the use of electronic records and interfere with coordination of care. They want to ease the marketing restrictions, notify patients only if security breaches are harmful, and keep the attorneys general out of the enforcement role."

It is a directional declaration of intent by two brand-name companies. But notably lacking, it seems, is a list of device makers, with amen quotes, hailing the software as the foundational technology that will help jump-start the market for Internet-connected home-monitoring devices. These potentially range from glucose meters and blood-pressure cuffs for managing chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease to digital weight scales and pulse monitors for personal health and fitness.

Still, the I.B.M.-Google pact is quite intriguing on a few fronts. Digital medical devices and online personal health records (like those offered by Google and Microsoft) are not the target of the $20 billion proposed by the Obama administration to accelerate the use of electronic medical records (typically tethered to doctors’ offices, clinics and hospitals).

But they are part of the same health information technology ecosystem, which is rapidly evolving. The I.B.M. software for linking devices and personal health records does provide for the fluid sharing of data among patients and health-care providers, according to the standards of an industry group, the Continua Health Alliance. And the legislation appropriating $20 billion for electronic health records calls for such data sharing, or interoperability. “This is a proof point that what the president wants to happen is possible,” said Dan Pelino, a general manager for I.B.M.’s health care and life sciences business.

The partnership announcement is also a sign that Google may be getting its act together in the health care arena. Google has assembled some outstanding people, attracted a blue-chip advisory group and started a few high-profile pilot projects including ones with Cleveland Clinic and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. But Google’s health initiative seems to have lacked strategy, leadership and focus, especially after the health team’s original head, Adam Bosworth, left in September 2007.

The view among health providers and medical experts is that the Google effort in health has so far been much less professional than Microsoft’s drive, led by Peter Neupert. Indeed, when the Cleveland Clinic wanted to try a home-monitoring pilot project last fall, it reached out to Microsoft instead of Google, despite the Internet company’s previous work with the Cleveland Clinic.

But by linking with I.B.M., Google picks up something it lacks — expertise in the industry of health care. Sameer Samat, the director for Google Health, implicitly acknowledged that when discussing the announcement the other day. “I.B.M. has a large services practice in health care and a tremendous installed base of its technology in medium-sized and large health care providers,” he said.

So it’s a smart move by Google. And because it is so early in the trend toward the digitization and consumerization of health information, Google’s early stumbling can be seen as an investment in learning a new field. Anything significant Google does in health is worth watching."

It is important to know about medications, allergies, test results, etc. But do you want every health care professional — or billing clerk or receptionist — to know, for example, that you got a sexually transmitted disease from your husband? (Doctors may record such information because it helps them recall and understand how to relate to individual patients.)

There is a way — through what’s known as a continuity of care record — to abstract health information that is widely useful without compromising more personal data. Before we embark on vastly expanding electronic records, let’s decide how to use them well. Lou Lukas, M.D.

Wal-Mart’s move comes as the Obama administration is trying to jump-start the adoption of digital medical records with $19 billion of incentives in the economic stimulus package.

The company plans to team its Sam’s Club division with Dell for computers and eClinicalWorks, a fast-growing private company, for software. Wal-Mart says its package deal of hardware, software, installation, maintenance and training will make the technology more accessible and affordable, undercutting rival health information technology suppliers by as much as half.

“We’re a high-volume, low-cost company,” said Marcus Osborne, senior director for health care business development at Wal-Mart. “And I would argue that mentality is sorely lacking in the health care industry.”

The Sam’s Club offering, to be made available this spring, will be under $25,000 for the first physician in a practice, and about $10,000 for each additional doctor. After the installation and training, continuing annual costs for maintenance and support will be $4,000 to $6,500 a year, the company estimates.

Wal-Mart says it had explored the opportunity in health information technology long before the presidential election. About 200,000 health care providers, mostly doctors, are among Sam Club’s 47 million members. And the company’s research showed the technology was becoming less costly and interest was rising among small physician practices, according to Todd Matherly, vice president for health and wellness at Sam’s Club.

The financial incentives in the administration plan ? more than $40,000 per physician over a few years, to install and use electronic health records ? could accelerate adoption. When used properly, most health experts agree, digital records can curb costs and improve care.

But many, especially physicians in small offices, doubt the wisdom of switching to electronic health records, given their cost and complexity.

Only about 17 percent of the nation’s physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine. The use of electronic health records is widespread in large physician groups, but three-fourths of the nation’s doctors work in small practices of 10 physicians or fewer.

Wal-Mart, however, has the potential to bring not only lower costs but also an efficient distribution channel to cater to small physician groups. Traditional health technology suppliers, experts say, have tended to shun the small physician offices because it has been costly to sell to them. Taken together, they make up a large market, but they are scattered.

“If Wal-Mart is successful, this could be a game-changer,” observed Dr. David J. Brailer, former national coordinator for health information technology in the Bush administration.

In the package, Dell is offering either a desktop or a tablet personal computer. Many physicians prefer tablet PCs because they more closely resemble their familiar paper notepads and make for easier communication with the patient, since the doctor is not behind a desktop screen.

EClinicalWorks, which is used by 25,000 physicians, mostly in small practices, will provide the electronic record and practice management software, for billing and patient registration, as a service over the Internet. This “software as a service” model can trim costs considerably and make technical support and maintenance less complicated, because less software resides on the personal computer in a doctor’s office.

Dell will be responsible for installation of the computers, while eClinicalWorks will handle software installation, training and maintenance. Wal-Mart is using its buying power for discounts on both the hardware and software.

Wal-Mart’s role, according to Mr. Osborne, is to put the bundle of technology into an affordable and accessible offering. “We’re the systems integrator, an aggregator,” he said.

The company’s test bed for the technology it will soon offer physicians has been its own health care clinics, staffed by third-party physicians and nurses. Started in September 2006, 30 such clinics are now in stores in eight states. The clinics use the technology Wal-Mart will offer to physicians.

“That’s where the learning came from, and they were the kernel of this idea,” Mr. Osborne said."

I must agree wholeheartedly with Dr. Anne Armstrong-Coben: the presence of a computer in the exam room is more of a detriment than an advantage.

The physician focuses on the computer and misses patient or parental body language (I’m a pediatrician, too). Awful mistakes may get clicked and pass unnoticed. Girls may be described as having male genitalia and vice versa.

What is most troublesome to me is that our residents — no matter how much we grayheads or graybeards model the approach to history-taking from parents — learn that the checklist on the computer screen is the thing to look at, and not the living person describing their child and her problems.

I could not agree more with Dr. Anne Armstrong-Coben. The computers we all use were invented as bookkeeping machines. At this they are superb.

They are not good at shoehorning the analog world into digital format. In fact, computers aren’t meant to help physicians; they are meant to gather data for others at the expense of physicians’ time, attention and job performance.

A mentor of mine once told a story of a patient whose son admired a certain Russian poet. He made a notation of this in his office note.

Several years later, upon seeing this woman again, he inquired as to whether her son “still read Pushkin.” The patient nearly fell off her chair, so taken was she by her doctor’s recalling this seemingly trivial but meaningful fact.

I have used this anecdote repeatedly in my own career, jotting down reminders as to my own patients’ reading proclivities and other personal miscellany. Bringing up these tidbits at future visits is useful in creating trust between patient and doctor.

Unfortunately, I have yet to encounter an electronic medical record system that allows one to document the reading habits of the patient or his family members.

Dr. Anne Armstrong-Coben makes a legitimate point about computerizing physicians’ notes. The model she describes is simply a glorified questionnaire, similar to the one on that clipboard we’re asked to fill out in the waiting room during our first visit. That model is neither efficient nor effective.

What could work would be to take notes as she is now doing, then scan them into the permanent electronic record. This would achieve the accessibility of electronic records, and the personalization she wishes to retain.

As for the illegible handwriting: That’s a product of laziness; almost anyone can teach himself to write legibly!

This transference from human to computer, as if the records become the human, isn’t special to the medical profession. It exists in other professions and in any institution where personal data are electronically gathered.

It explains how you can feel as if you barely exist when in front of a keeper of these records, whether a doctor or a clerk at your local motor vehicle agency.

As they stare intently into their computer screens, they are looking at the real you that exists for them, the one in the computer.

To the Editor:

Dr. Anne Armstrong-Coben’s story is a cautionary tale. It illustrates why most of the $17 billion in President Obama’s stimulus package for promoting electronic medical records will add to the cost of care, not reduce it.

Dr. Armstrong-Coben is applying the computer to a method of pediatric practice that has been in effect from time immemorial. The cost of computers has been added to the cost of her practice without, it seems, improving her efficiency.

What she ought to be doing is thinking up a new, better and less expensive way to provide health care to children that is practical only with computers and then get someone to develop a program to support it.

Not being a pediatrician, I would not presume to suggest what that way might be, but I’m sure that it is out there waiting to be discovered.

Here's some advice on how to avoid the pitfalls.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/health/21patient.html,1210,Americans are traveling to other countries in search of affordable health care. Here’s some advice on how to avoid the pitfalls.,"Medical tourism is expected to expand quickly in the coming years because of rising health care costs in the United States, increasing availability of international facilities with United States accreditation, and the fact that insurers and employers are beginning to embrace the practice.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina, for example, has started a subsidiary company, Companion Global Healthcare, to offer medical tourism services to individuals and businesses. Hannaford supermarkets in Maine recently added an international option for hip replacements to its health care plan.

At the moment, however, the bulk of medical tourism candidates are uninsured and underinsured people paying their own bills and looking for low-cost alternatives to American care. Medical tourism advocates argue that the quality of care overseas is often equal to or better than that in the United States. Many countries have high success rates, American-trained English-speaking doctors and the newest facilities, often built specifically to attract foreign patients.

But there are no comprehensive data that adequately compare overseas surgical outcomes or other quality measures to those used in the United States, said Dr. Sharon Kleefield of the Harvard Medical School and a specialist in overseas health care quality measures.

“No matter how high your hospital is rated, there are issues with regard to quality and safety when you travel for medical treatment,” she said.

The American Medical Association, also worried about the risks associated with overseas medical travel and the difficulty in getting adequate follow-up care, issued guidelines on medical tourism last June. (They’re available on the Web at tinyurl.com/cpklcw.)

With those cautions in mind, here’s what you need to know if you are considering an international medical option:

Determine whether you are a good candidate. “Traveling for surgery is a big deal,” said Josef Woodman, author of “Patients Beyond Borders: Everybody’s Guide to Affordable World-Class Medical Tourism.” Recovery time is often compressed, and a long flight home can cause complications like a blood clot. You’ll need to provide a thorough health history and have a physical stateside before you go to make sure you can withstand the trip.

Mr. Woodman points out that not every condition should be treated overseas: “Orthopedic and nonemergency heart procedures have some of the highest success rates. But with something like cancer, you need the ongoing relationship with your oncologist and health care team.”

Get a reliable middleman. Dozens of medical tourism facilitators and planners have sprung up in the past decade hoping to capitalize on the trend and simplify the process for consumers. “Unfortunately, plenty of unreliable firms have sprung up, too,” said Jonathan Edelheit, president of the Medical Tourism Association, a nonprofit organization made up of hospitals and facilitators that cater to traveling patients.

Good firms, said Mr. Edelheit, will match your medical needs with the best overseas hospitals and physicians; make your travel, lodging, visa and local transportation arrangements; handle billing; and help arrange follow-up care. For a list of facilitators vetted by the association, go to medicaltourismassociation.com. Once you narrow your search, ask each potential firm for references and former patients you can interview.

Check out quality yourself. Although medical tourism firms will say they work only with the highest quality hospitals and physicians, you’ll still need to check the records. Don’t be swayed by the luxurious private hospital rooms, gourmet food and other amenities splashed on the Web sites. You want to be sure you’re going to a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission, the organization that reviews both American and international medical and dental facilities, using United State standards. (Find it at www.jointcommissioninternational.org/.)

Be sure to read carefully, a commission spokeswoman, Elizabeth Zhani, warned. You may find a facility’s name on the accreditation list, but it may be that only an affiliated lab or clinic is accredited, not the entire facility.

“Keep in mind that commission accreditation is the floor, not the ceiling,” said Dr. Kleefield. You’ll want to ask your own questions about the facility’s blood safety, medication safety, infection rates and unexpected morbidity rates for the procedure you’re undergoing, and discuss the data with your American doctor.

Just as you would in the United States, you’ll want to interview the physician handling your case before you arrive. Ask if he or she was trained in the United States and is fluent in English, how often he or she has done the procedure you’re having, and what the long-term outcomes have been. Conducting this interview beforehand will also help you establish a rapport with your doctor before you go under the knife.

Arrange your follow-up care in advance. “The biggest stumbling block with medical travel is getting care when you return,” said David Boucher, chief executive of Companion Global. Doctors often balk at treating complications from overseas surgeries because they are unfamiliar with the procedures or prosthetics used or are worried about liability.

Meet with your general practitioner and any specialist who may have been treating you before you go, said Dr. Ted Epperly, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians: “They’ll be able to provide your medical records, either electronically or on paper, to your overseas doctors.”

Give your doctors in the United States specific details on where you are going for your procedure and contact information for your overseas doctors. And be sure to ask what medical records and information you need to bring home to complete your care.

Finally, before you leave, do your best to arrange a phone or e-mail conference between your doctors at home and abroad so communication will be established before a problem arises."

And our details have been spread from here to, well, all over the place — doctors’ offices, hospital archives, pharmacies, labs, billing companies and insurers’ computer networks.

Today, the World Privacy Forum has released a plain-spoken online guide that can help people regain some control and a measure of privacy over their health records.

The guide, a year in the making, takes on the less-than-fun challenge of dissecting complicated privacy rules created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, a 1996 federal statute that set data-privacy and security rules for key players in the American health care system. The new guide explains patient rights and provides practical advice about how to defend those rights using the law as well as basic social skills and common sense.

Especially useful are sections on how to retrieve medical records from the vortex that is our health system and request fixes if there are errors — vital stuff for anyone with a serious health condition or, for that matter, who’s moving to a new state, changing doctors, seeking a second opinion, considering a malpractice suit or concerned about false entries due to medical identity theft.

There’s also important information for people with ailments they prefer not to disclose to family members, friends or employers. Yes, you can ask the doctor’s office that’s treating you for a venereal disease to call you only on your cellphone and put any mail in plain sealed envelopes, and they should comply. But note that if you are hospitalized, for example, it will be harder to keep relatives and friends in the dark. You can make a formal request for confidentiality, but it probably won’t work. The better route is an informal appeal to your caregivers, W.P.F. says.

The guide also maps out how to seek redress if your rights have been violated, starting with contacting the chief privacy officer at the institution you’re having a problem with. If that fails, complain to the secretary of Health and Human Services via the Office of Civil Rights and perhaps also to your state’s health or insurance department. You can also go public, contacting any relevant licensing boards, writing bad reviews on the Web or, say, reaching out to a reporter."

A handful of chronic ailments, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, account for up to 80 percent of health care costs, according to medical experts, and 7 of 10 deaths in the United States.

Such chronic conditions, unless aggressively managed, worsen as people grow older. By 2030, about 71.5 million Americans will be 65 or older, the federal government estimates, up from 37 million in 2006.

The current market for telehealth and home health monitoring in North America and Europe is $3 billion, according to Data Monitor, a research firm, and is projected to rise to $7.7 billion by 2012. But much of remote monitoring today is done by nurses and physician assistants, who call patients with reminders and advice.

“Today’s systems just won’t scale,” said Louis J. Burns, general manager of Intel’s digital health group. “Health care has to go efficiently into the home, to enable elders to age in place with dignity.”

The early market for their high-tech remote monitoring systems, the companies’ executives say, will be integrated health providers in the United States and abroad, insurers and specialized disease-management companies.

Intel has sold systems to Advanced Warning Systems, a disease management company, and has pilot projects under way with several institutions ranging from the American insurer Aetna to a Scottish region of Britain’s National Health Service.

Managing chronic conditions is typically not reimbursed in America’s fee-for-service system of health care, which pays for procedures, treatments and office visits but often not preventive care.

But there have been some Medicare pilot projects to pay providers based on improved health outcomes for patients, mainly those with chronic conditions. And the Obama administration has pledged to accelerate that drive, promoting electronic health records, for example, as a way to measure the quality of care and health outcomes.

Analysts and industry executives say the market for personal health care technology, like remote monitoring, could benefit considerably if reimbursement moves toward a pay-for-performance system.

“If nothing changes, this is going to be a big business because of the demographics,” said Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of G.E. “But the only way to really change health care is to have some metrics about outcomes and quality. And you need technology to do that.”"
58,848,2009-04-06T00:00:00Z,article,A Hospital Is Offering Digital Records,546933f738f0d8317bec0bc8,"subject:Electronic Health Records, subject:Medicine and Health, organizations:New York-Presbyterian Hospital, organizations:Microsoft Corp, organizations:Google Inc",Business,0.0,Companies,"NewYork-Presbyterian moves beyond the pilot project stage on consumer-controlled health records this week, a move that will be closely watched by other institutions.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/technology/companies/06health.html,774,"NewYork-Presbyterian moves beyond the pilot project stage on consumer-controlled health records this week, a move that will be closely watched by other institutions.","Initially, patients will be given on-site help signing on and setting up passwords, and access to the Web portal for personal health records, myNYP.org, will be controlled.

But the goal is to scale up the introduction over months. “We view this as widely applicable to all our patient population,” said Dr. Steven J. Corwin, chief operating officer of NewYork-Presbyterian.

NewYork-Presbyterian has had its own computerized records for patients for years, and Dr. Corwin says the use of electronic medical records to track care inside the hospital system has saved money and improved outcomes, for instance, reducing medication errors considerably.

Seeking similar gains across the health care system, the Obama administration plans to spend $19 billion over the next few years to accelerate the adoption of electronic health records in doctors’ offices and hospitals.

The government’s plan has no incentives for consumer-controlled health records. But Dr. Corwin says the personal health record is a “powerful additional tool for improving health care” and one that offers added benefits because “the data is controlled by the patient, not tethered to an institution.”

One significant benefit is the mobility of information and ease of access to an online personal health record, said Dr. Mehmet Oz, a heart surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian.

Many of his patients are referrals from outside the NewYork-Presbyterian system. When they arrive, Dr. Oz said, they typically come in with incomplete paper records and patchy recollections of past care. When they leave the hospital, he added, they get paper records of their care and a check-list of reminders.

“The paper-based system is sort of ‘Here, and good luck,’ ” Dr. Oz said. “It’s cumbersome and dangerous.”

Nationally, 20 percent of heart-surgery patients are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, often for preventable conditions like fluid buildup in the lungs, which can be easily monitored and prevented. The online personal health record makes efficient communication and continuity of care far easier, Dr. Oz said. It can be accessed by the patient and, with permission, relatives and a patient’s personal physician,

Personal health records, experts say, hold considerable promise, but much depends on how complete the information is in them. “Something like what NewYork-Presbyterian is doing is a great step, but it’s only part of the answer,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, former national health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration.

If a patient gets all or nearly all his or her care in one health system, then the personal health record will be rich in information, and very useful, Dr. Brailer said. But if some doctors or clinics put information in and others do not, it will be less useful. The ideal, he said, is for most patient information to be in digital form and, with safeguards for privacy, be collaboratively shared by health providers and patients.

Still, Patrice Daly Cohen, 50, who had heart-valve replacement surgery in February at NewYork-Presbyterian, is impressed by the benefits of the personal health record, which she has used in the pilot project. When she needed the report of her operation for her physician, she went online and printed it out.

When she was home recovering in West Caldwell, N.J., Ms. Cohen read over the daily reports from her hospital stay, which had been automatically dropped into her personal health record.

“It was almost too much information,” she said. “But I am someone who likes to be in control. I think it’s great.”"
59,844,2009-04-18T00:00:00Z,article,Some Caveats About Keeping Your Own Electronic Health Records,54698d1338f0d8317bec13fe,"subject:Electronic Health Records, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Medicine and Health",Business,0.0,None,Much work remains to be done before detailed medical files and seamless communication can improve the quality of health care.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/health/18patient.html,1100,Much work remains to be done before detailed medical files and seamless communication can improve the quality of health care.,"In reality, very few doctors have set up their own electronic record-keeping systems, let alone ones that are compatible with patients’ home-based files. And “only 9 percent of hospitals use electronic records,” said Dr. Jha, who was the lead author of a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, pointing to the field’s current limitations.

What’s more, building your personal electronic medical file can be time-consuming and cumbersome. My quick test drive of the four most visible online health record keepers — Google Health Records, Microsoft HealthVault, RevolutionHealth Health Record and WebMd Personal Health Record — made it clear to me that, for now, interested consumers will in many cases spend hours tracking down information from doctors, hospitals and labs, and then painstakingly entering the data into the electronic record themselves.

And patients will need to be scrupulous about making sure the electronic records are up to date and accurate. I was startled to read about a patient’s experience with one of these systems, and the inaccurate data he discovered in his file, as reported this week in The Boston Globe.

All the upfront work of setting up an electronic health record can be easier and more worthwhile if you happen to be one of the few patients whose health care providers are themselves making an electronic push. Both Google and Microsoft have forged some early partnerships with big medical centers, including New York Presbyterian, the Cleveland Clinic and Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston. Google and Microsoft also both share data with several big pharmacies and other health care providers. And the Microsoft HealthVault, for instance, lets patients download data from various medical monitoring devices. One Cleveland Clinic patient with hypertension, a long-distance truck driver, was able, from the road, to feed his doctor daily results from his blood pressure monitor. Based on that data, the doctor instructed the man to adjust his medications, and the driver was able to stabilize his blood pressure in a matter of days.

The list of partnerships with health providers is expected to grow as both Microsoft and Google push to become the leader in the personal electronic medical records business. But progress is being slowed by incompatible technologies, privacy concerns and resistance by many health care providers to installing expensive electronic systems.

For most patients, Dr. Jha says, it probably makes more sense to wait until one’s primary care doctor or other regular health care provider makes the move toward shared electronic records. “Then you can get the full benefit of seamless communication,” he said.

There are exceptions. If you have a chronic health condition, or you are taking care of a family member or someone else with such a condition, electronic records might make a lot of sense.

“Having a full history, health provider contact information and a list of current prescription drugs that any caregiver can get their hands on is invaluable in an emergency,” said Dr. Ted Epperly, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

And electronic records can make it easier to monitor chronic conditions, said Dr. C. Martin Harris, chief information officer of the Cleveland Clinic and head of the National Health Information Infrastructure Task Force.

“Say you have diabetes,” Dr. Harris said. “Before, you would go home, check your blood sugar and write down the results on a piece of paper somewhere and then lose it. With electronic records you have an organized place to store the data and an appropriate way to present them to your doctor. That means he or she can use the data much more effectively.”

If you decide to become an early adopter of electronic medical records, you must be vigilant about updating your files every time a medical event takes place, Dr. Epperly advises. That means everything from refilling a prescription to visiting the emergency room.

“If your doctor is under the impression the records are up to date, but a prescription is missing or a surgery follow-up isn’t listed,” he said, “that can be dangerous.”

With all these caveats in mind, here are brief descriptions of four of the online health record systems now being offered, at no initial fee, to consumers who might want to set up their own electronic medical files.

GOOGLE HEALTH Google’s system has partnerships with the Cleveland Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess, Quest Diagnostics, several pharmacies and other organizations. Google Health will let you connect to vendors who, for a fee, will transcribe your paper medical records into your electronic file.

MICROSOFT HEALTHVAULT Some users may be able to import data from a small group of medical providers including New York Presbyterian Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Quest Laboratories, several pharmacies and others. HealthVault also has agreements with medical device makers to let patients import data from devices like blood pressure and blood glucose monitors.

REVOLUTIONHEALTH HEALTH RECORDS Users input medical data themselves, or RevolutionHealth employees will input records faxed to them directly from your health care providers. You will be directed to information and advice on the Revolution Health site related to your medical condition.

WEBMD PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD This system lets users store medical records, family histories and other health data. The site will direct you to WebMD information and tools related to your health data."

Two unusual cases of infection with an unknown strain of swine flu were discovered in San Diego area children last month, The Washington Post reports. More than 50 C.D.C. scientists are investigating the infections, which occurred simultaneously in two children who had no contact with pigs or with each other.

Breast Cancer Deaths Fall in Britain

The number of British women who died of breast cancer dipped to a record low, under 12,000, for the first time in 2007, BBC reports. The dip, the lowest since 1971 when officials started keeping records, occurred despite rising rates of diagnosis. Experts say better care and screening are saving lives.

Fewer Doctors Disciplined, Survey Finds

Fewer than three of every 1,000 doctors were the targets of serious disciplinary action by state medical boards last year, according to a report by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, The Wall Street Journal reports. The organization says the rate of license revocations and suspensions last year was lower than the peak figure of 3.72 per 1,000 in 2004.

Doctor Claims to Have Cloned Human Embryos

A controversial fertility doctor based in the United States says he has cloned 14 human embryos and transferred 11 of them into women's wombs, though none of the women became pregnant, Agence France-Presse reports. Dr. Panayiotis Zavos told British newspaper The Independent that he will continue his efforts.

That performance may be misleading, however. Personal income includes the cost of benefits, so rising health care expenses for employees count in that number. The decline would be larger if it were based strictly on wage and salary receipts.

The two areas in which this is already the worst recession since 1960 are employment and industrial production. The number of jobs in the country has fallen by 3.7 percent, exceeding the 3.1 percent decline in the 1981-82 recession. Economists generally expect those numbers to get worse before they stabilize.

The 13.4 percent fall in industrial production, while worse than in previous recessions, is better than in some countries. The worldwide recession has slashed both production and international trade, and the impact is being felt most in export-driven economies in Asia.

The fourth category used in the coincident indicators is manufacturing and trade sales, a broad picture of total transactions in the economy. Adjusted for inflation, that has fallen 9.8 percent since the peak, a bit more than the decline in 1981-82 but not yet close to the 12.9 percent decline in the 1970s recession.

This recession is also bidding to be the longest in recent history. If it ends in May — which seems unlikely — it will have lasted 16 months, tying it with the 1973-75 and 1981-82 downturns as the longest since World War II.

The Index of Coincident Indicators did not exist in the 1930s. But there is no doubt that the declines in the Great Depression would have been far greater than anything experienced since.

It also lasted much longer. As measured by the National Bureau, there were actually two recessions during the period we now remember as the Great Depression — 1929 to 1933 and 1937 to 1938 — separated by a recovery that did not come close to restoring the economy to its pre-Depression size. That first downturn lasted 43 months, nearly three times as long as this recession has lasted until now.

Doctors, hospitals, drug makers and insurance companies will join President Obama on Monday in announcing their commitment to a sharp reduction in the growth of national health spending, White House officials said Sunday.

The officials said the plan could save $2,500 a year for a family of four in the fifth year and a total of $2 trillion for the nation over 10 years. That could make it less expensive for Congress to enact comprehensive health insurance coverage, a daunting challenge facing the Obama administration.

At this point, administration officials said, they do not have a way to enforce the commitment, other than by publicizing the performance of health care providers to hold them accountable.

By offering to hold down costs voluntarily, providers said, they hope to stave off new government price constraints that might be imposed by Congress or a National Health Board of the kind favored by many Democrats.

In remarks prepared for delivery to health care providers on Monday, Mr. Obama says: “These groups are voluntarily coming together to make an unprecedented commitment. Over the next 10 years, from 2010 to 2019, they are pledging to cut the growth rate of national health care spending by 1.5 percentage points each year ? an amount that’s equal to over $2 trillion.”

“Reform is not a luxury that can be postponed, but a necessity that cannot wait,” Mr. Obama says.

In a letter addressed to Mr. Obama, six leaders of the health care industry say: “We will do our part to achieve your administration’s goal of decreasing by 1.5 percentage points the annual health care spending growth rate, saving $2 trillion or more. This represents more than a 20 percent reduction in the projected rate of growth.”

The letter was signed by executives of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a lobby for medical device manufacturers; the American Hospital Association; the American Medical Association; America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; and the Service Employees International Union.

Signers of the letter said that large amounts could be saved by aggressive efforts to prevent obesity, coordinate care, manage chronic illnesses and curtail unnecessary tests and procedures; by standardizing insurance claim forms; and by increasing the use of information technology, like electronic medical records.

Administration officials said private insurers and government programs could also save money by paying for entire episodes of care, rather than for each service separately.

An administration official, speaking in a conference call on Sunday, said, “The savings are crucially dependent on getting health care reform done this year.” The administration insisted that the official not be identified.

Some of the savings could be achieved by voluntary action in the private sector. But most of the savings in Medicare and Medicaid could not be achieved without changes in federal law and regulations.

In the abstract, slowing the growth of health spending is a goal on which consumers and health care providers agree. But experience shows that specific proposals touch off fierce battles among interest groups fighting to expand their share of health care money.

In a relatively rosy forecast, the White House said Sunday that the savings from a more efficient health care system would far exceed the costs of achieving universal health coverage, with federal subsidies for people who could not afford insurance on their own.

The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that health spending will grow an average of 6.2 percent a year in the coming decade, to $4.4 trillion in 2018 from $2.4 trillion last year.

Health care now accounts for about 17 percent of the overall economy and, with no change in existing law, the share will grow to 21 percent in 2019, administration officials said. The commitments made by health care providers would hold down the share to 18 percent of the economy, and that difference is equivalent to savings of nearly $700 billion in 2019 alone, the officials said.

The goal set forth in the letter resembles a proposal made in December by America’s Health Insurance Plans, the lobby for insurers like Aetna, Humana, UnitedHealth and WellPoint. Administration officials said the idea was broached to them by Dennis Rivera, coordinator of the health care campaign of the Service Employees International Union.

In a report being sent to Congress on Monday, two research and advocacy groups, the Center for American Progress and the Democratic Leadership Council, say that productivity growth in health care has lagged behind that of other industries.

The government could save nearly $600 billion over the next decade if the health care industry increased its productivity growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points a year, said the report, by David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist."
64,819,2009-06-06T00:00:00Z,article,Discredited Research Study Stuns an Ex-Army Doctor's Colleagues,54529bc238f0d81b603ecc70,"organizations:Reed, Walter, Army Medical Center, persons:Kuklo, Timothy R, organizations:United States Army, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Hospitals, subject:Iraq War (2003- ), subject:Research, organizations:Washington University, organizations:Medtronic Inc, subject:Frauds and Swindling",Business,0.0,None,"Officials uncovered an apparent case of falsified research by a doctor who had befriended another physician at Walter Reed, and seemingly attached that doctor's name to his study.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/business/06surgeon.html,1811,"Officials uncovered an apparent case of falsified research by a doctor who had befriended another physician at Walter Reed, and seemingly attached that doctor’s name to his study.","The British journal that published Dr. Kuklo’s study retracted it in March and has banned him from its pages. His future at Washington University will very likely be determined by an inquiry the medical school is said to be conducting. University officials declined to comment for this article.

The Walter Reed episode also shows how medical journals may fail to conduct adequate due diligence on the studies they publish — information that other doctors rely on for guidance. As happened in the Kuklo case, for example, they often deal only with a study’s principal author, rather than all the credited contributors. In his study, Dr. Kuklo, who has not responded to repeated interview requests, reported that a bone-growth product sold by Medtronic, called Infuse, performed “strikingly” better than the traditional bone-grafting technique used to heal soldiers’ shattered shin bones. Other Walter Reed doctors told an Army investigator that claim was overblown.

Medtronic financed some of Dr. Kuklo’s research and travel while he was at Walter Reed and hired him as a consultant in August 2006 when he took his current academic post. But Dr. Kuklo did not disclose his Medtronic relationship in the journal article, which was published in August 2008.

Medtronic has declined to provide the financial details of its relationship with Dr. Kuklo, although the company said Friday that it planned to provide some of that information next week to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who is investigating the matter.

Medtronic has said that it had no involvement in the disputed Infuse study, despite its business ties to Dr. Kuklo. The report was published in Britain last August in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Colleagues and friends of Dr. Kuklo say they are shocked by the accusations against him and predict he will eventually be cleared of any wrongdoing.

“I think that Tim is a brilliant researcher and surgeon,” said Lt. Col. Richard C. Rooney, a spine surgeon at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Tex., who knows Dr. Kuklo and his work. “I don’t believe the accusations. I don’t care if the head of Walter Reed made them.”

For his part, Dr. Kuklo did not formally respond to Army investigators. But Col. J. Edwin Atwood, an Army cardiologist who led the Army’s inquiry, wrote in his report that even if Dr. Kuklo had participated, it might have had little influence on his findings.

“What has transpired here,” he wrote, “is the ultimate tragedy and catastrophe in academic medicine.”

Treating War’s Injured

With the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the orthopedics department of Walter Reed, a sprawling facility in Washington, became an extension of the front lines. The injured included soldiers with gaping holes in their lower legs caused by explosive devices like homemade bombs filled with ball-bearings and nails. Hundreds of them would receive amputations.

Dr. Kuklo, a native of Canton, Ohio, who had come to Walter Reed as a medical resident in the 1990s, was one of the specialists who treated the wounded.

Back then, his colleagues viewed Dr. Kuklo, a West Point graduate who is married with two children, as likable, hard-working and ambitious. Dr. Andersen also once considered him a friend, and credits Dr. Kuklo with helping him to decide to become an orthopedist. “He was a good mentor,” said Dr. Andersen, who is currently serving in a combat hospital in Baghdad.

Infuse, the subject of Dr. Kuklo’s study, is a bioengineered bone-growth protein that the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2002. Walter Reed surgeons used it both in certain spinal surgeries and to treat severe leg injuries.

Dr. Kuklo, a spine specialist, also had other research interests that dovetailed with Medtronic’s; while at the military hospital, he led five studies financed by the company, Army officials say.

His controversial study had its roots in a short five-paragraph paper, or abstract, that Dr. Kuklo presented at a 2005 meeting of a medical group, the Orthopaedic Trauma Association. In it, he reported that Infuse had healed fractured shins in 28 of 32 soldiers treated, or 88 percent, adding that “further research on this exciting technology is warranted.”

Not long after that presentation, Dr. Kuklo’s military career began to wind down. Along with a consulting deal, he struck a separate arrangement with Medtronic in August 2006 that would pay him royalties for any spinal devices he developed. Army officials say they have been unable to find records to indicate that Dr. Kuklo either sought or was given permission to strike the Medtronic deals.

Dr. Kuklo, who moved into a $2.1 million home near St. Louis, was not the first departing Walter Reed doctor to get a consulting deal from Medtronic. For instance, it had struck an arrangement with Dr. Kuklo’s former boss, Dr. David W. Polly Jr., when he left the military hospital in 2003.

Dr. Polly is now one of Dr. Kuklo’s staunchest public defenders. Recently, Dr. Polly blocked a reporter’s request that the University of Minnesota, where he now works, release his financial disclosure statement showing how much he made from Medtronic.

Starting an Inquiry

When Dr. Andersen first learned about the Infuse article last summer, he said he thought that Dr. Kuklo might have made honest mistakes in his study. But after talking with the article’s other supposed co-authors and checking Walter Reed records, he became convinced that parts of it had been fabricated. So he called Dr. Kuklo and confronted him.

Dr. Kuklo defended the study, saying that all the data had been drawn either from Walter Reed files or from his personal records that he had left behind at the hospital.

Unconvinced, Dr. Andersen notified Army officials and the editor of the British journal in September about his concerns.

In his 2005 abstract, Dr. Kuklo had reported only Infuse results. But his August 2008 journal article cited other Walter Reed data to compare Infuse with the traditional bone-graft treatment for fractured shins. He declared Infuse the winner by a wide margin.

Dr. Kuklo said he had reached that finding by reviewing the records of two groups of the soldiers with similarly severe leg injuries, who had been treated either with Infuse or a bone graft. But Dr. Andersen suspected that Dr. Kuklo had fabricated the comparison groups, because many soldiers had received both Infuse and a bone graft — not one or the other.

“It was like he was comparing apples and oranges,” Dr. Andersen said. “But there weren’t any apples or oranges to compare.”

The British periodical was not the first place Dr. Kuklo submitted his article. Army investigators were told that he had tried first, without success, to publish it in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the country’s premier medical journals. A spokeswoman for The New England Journal declined to comment.

Dr. Kuklo told Dr. Andersen that he had also sent the study to a leading American orthopedic periodical, The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, before submitting it to the British journal. (The two similarly named journals operate independently.)

Dr. Andersen contacted the American journal’s editor, Dr. James D. Heckman, who confirmed in an e-mail message that Dr. Kuklo had submitted the report in mid-2007. The journal rejected it two months later, sending Dr. Kuklo the comments of an editor and two outside doctors who had reviewed it, Dr. Heckman wrote.

Dr. Andersen, curious about what Dr. Kuklo had actually submitted, asked Dr. Heckman for copies of those reviews. But the editor turned him down, even though Dr. Andersen was supposedly one of the study’s authors. In a recent interview, Dr. Heckman said that his journal, like many others, considered such reviews confidential and shared them only with a study’s lead author.

“It is all confidential information,” Dr. Heckman said, when asked by a reporter for the reviews. “It is protected by the peer-review process.”

Last October, Dr. Kuklo received a telephone call from Colonel Atwood at Walter Reed.

After describing his inquiry, Colonel Atwood put a military lawyer on the phone who told Dr. Kuklo that he was suspected of “conduct unbecoming an officer,” a formal charge, and read him his legal rights.

Questioning Signatures

Dr. Kuklo, who then hired a lawyer, did not respond to a series of questions posed by Colonel Atwood, the Army’s inquiry shows. In a recent interview, Dr. Polly, the former Walter Reed physician who is now a Medtronic consultant, said Dr. Kuklo was mistaken to sign his co-authors’ names. But he added that was not uncommon in the military for one officer, when it was expedient, to sign for another.

Dr. Kuklo, however, did not indicate that he was signing his four co-authors’ names on their behalf. He even used a distinctively different handwriting style for each of them, a form he submitted to the British journal shows.

Colonel Atwood concluded that his inquiry had substantiated all the accusations against the physician.

“I view this as potentially having the worst consequences to Walter Reed of any event that has occurred during my six-year tenure,” he wrote in his report.

Later this month, Dr. Andersen expects to return to Walter Reed from Baghdad, to take a new position as the hospital’s chief orthopedic surgeon He says that it has been difficult to reconcile the Dr. Kuklo he knew with the false research he says he believes his former mentor published.

“When your impressions of someone are that they would never do something like this, it was difficult for me,” Dr. Andersen said. “But the more I looked at the data, the more I said this just can’t be close to being true.”"

By stepping off the big-clinic treadmill, where doctors are sometimes asked to see a different patient every 15 minutes, Dr. Batlle has joined the vanguard of physicians trying to redefine health care. These doctors spend more time with patients, emphasize prevention and education to keep them healthy and can handle many medical problems without referrals to specialists.

In many cases, this kind of care can reduce a patient’s medical bills. That’s more crucial than ever: according to a study published online by the American Journal of Medicine, 60 percent of all bankruptcies in the United States in 2007 were driven by health care costs.

Exact numbers are hard to come by, but doctors involved in this movement, called “patient centered” practices, say its popularity is growing.

“I travel to a lot of medical conferences, and I’m meeting more and more doctors embarking on this path,” said Dr. L. Gordon Moore, who runs IdealMedicalPractices.org, a program to help small practices become more innovative and efficient. The Web site IdealMedicalHome.org has about 800 doctors who post and trade ideas, while more than 700 physicians have adopted methods from HowsYourHealth.org. Many of these doctors see fewer patients per day than they did before.

To make personalized care possible in an era when compensation is often tied to the number of patients they see, doctors use technology to streamline processes and reduce administrative costs. Dr. Batlle, for example, uses online appointment scheduling and manages his medical records electronically. He prescribes medications from his computer and offers virtual visits by phone and e-mail.

It cost Dr. Batlle about $25,000 to buy the technology to make all of this possible, but he estimates that he saves close to $100,000 a year in salaries and billing costs. And he has made enough money to begin renovations on a new office in Washington Heights in Manhattan.

The model seems to be working, according to a 2008 study by Dr. John H. Wasson at Dartmouth Medical School. His research showed that patients in patient-centered practices were more likely to say they were informed about how to manage chronic diseases and got the care they needed, compared with those in a national sample of medical practices. They also were less likely to say they had to wait for an appointment.

“If the goal is to deliver patient care when and how they want and need it, this is the way to go,” Dr. Wasson said.

Of course, even doctors in this movement acknowledge that it is not a panacea for the country’s health care problems. Privacy advocates warn that electronic patient records can be breached, and computer glitches can make patient records inaccessible for hours. Big clinics can be better for people who have several health problems and need easy access to a variety of specialists. Moreover, some doctors may not want to leave a big clinic because they feel they lack the technical or business skills they need — or because a salaried job there may be more stable in this economy.

And while the patient-centered movement is growing, the nation may not be able to afford to have all its primary care doctors reduce the number of patients they see. Across the country, primary care physicians are in short supply, in part because average salaries for family practitioners are the lowest of any medical specialty. According to a 2008 survey of physician salaries by the American Medical Group Association, their average annual salary is $201,555, versus $356,166 for a general surgeon and $614,536 for a neurological surgeon.

“Medical school loans can be so high, you need to be a specialist to pay them back,” Dr. Batlle said. “But our country doesn’t need yet another sleep apnea specialist.”

LILI SACKS, a primary care doctor in Seattle, says she began thinking differently about her work on the day she realized she was beginning each appointment with the words, “Sorry I’m late.”

Scheduled to see as many as 25 patients a day at a large clinic, she lacked the time for thorough examinations and discussions. Because of this, she said, primary care doctors are often forced to order tests and send patients to specialists.

“Could I have helped some people without specialists and tests? Absolutely,” said Dr. Sacks. “Would it have saved the patient and the insurance company both money? Absolutely. Is the system set up for the best care and cost efficiency? Absolutely not.”

Dr. Sacks said she worried that seeing so many patients would lead to errors. Last year, she moved to a clinic that focuses on longer patient appointments, 30 to 60 minutes. This translates to 10 to 12 patients a day. Patients also communicate directly with her by phone or e-mail.

During those longer appointments, Dr. Sacks can perform basic lab tests and simple procedures, so patients see fewer specialists.

“I probably head off a handful of emergency-room visits and hospital stays every month because patients can see me as soon as they have a problem, and I can be thorough rather than rushed,” she said.

One patient who avoided the emergency room was Todd Martin, a store manager in Seattle who went to Dr. Sacks’s clinic on a Saturday.

“I couldn’t stop coughing and was having trouble breathing,” Mr. Martin said. “They were able to see me and give me a chest X-ray.”

Mr. Martin said he spent $40 for the resulting prescription but the rest was covered by a monthly fee he pays Dr. Sacks. “A weekend visit to the E.R. would have easily cost $1,000,” he said.

Dr. Sacks charges patients a direct monthly fee of $54 to $129 based on age, and she doesn’t take insurance. Her office calls its philosophy “direct practice” because it’s a direct contract between doctor and patient. But she advises patients to obtain insurance plans to cover large, unexpected health costs like those to treat cancer or a heart attack.

“We say it’s like having a car and paying for your own oil changes and tuneups, but getting insurance in case you need a big repair,” she said.

Dr. Garrison Bliss, who in 2007 founded the group where Dr. Sacks works, has offered direct-practice services since 1997. He says patients can save 15 to 40 percent of their medical costs by using this model, based on his examination of insurance rates and his belief that good primary care can fill most of a patient’s needs.

Insurance plans that cover every little thing can be very expensive, Dr. Bliss said. He said that a patient who paid an annual fee at his clinic and took out a higher-deductible insurance plan would usually come out ahead, even if the patient’s health needs meant that he or she had to pay the entire deductible.

Dr. Bliss’s office operates with just two administrative employees for seven doctors. He estimates that if he took insurance, one or two administrative workers would be needed per doctor.

Insurance administration costs can take a big bite out of a practice’s revenue. A recent Weill Cornell Medical College study found that a third of the money received by primary care physicians pays for interactions between a doctor’s practice and patients’ health plans.

Patricia Rogers Caroselli, a retired assistant principal who is a patient of Dr. Sacks, dreaded going to her former clinic. “The waiting room was always noisy and crowded,” she said. In the examining room, she felt that she should “get in and out and not waste the doctor’s time with questions,” she said.

In contrast, she said, she appreciates the friendly calm of Dr. Sacks’s new surroundings and the personal attention. “Everyone should have this kind of patient care,” she said.

Dr. Sacks said the financial mechanics of the direct-practice model match her medical goals. When she was compensated based on insurance, she was paid every time she saw a patient. Now, if she can use education and prevention to reduce office visits, she and her patients benefit, she said.

“Having more time to sit with each patient has made me a better doctor,” she said. “I had a disabled patient that I saw for 13 years. Until she came to my new clinic, I never had the time to learn the details of her accident and the resulting complications. I was always treating whatever the immediate concern was.”

TECHNOLOGY has helped many doctors reduce costs. Dr. Batlle says he has been building his arsenal of technology solutions one by one, with “lots of trial and error,” for eight years.

Recently, he saw a 52-year-old patient with hypertension. As he examined the patient, noting blood pressure and other vital signs, he entered the information into his laptop computer to add to the patient’s electronic medical record. He also typed in the codes for billing and insurance.

The patient wondered if he was due for a prescription refill, so Dr. Batlle checked his computer again, found that he was, and hit a button to send the refill request to the pharmacy. As the patient left, Dr. Batlle hit the keyboard to send the bill electronically to the insurance company.

“He’ll even go to the Web to schedule his follow-up appointment,” Dr. Batlle said. “I don’t pay a receptionist to sit and answer phones.”

Dr. Batlle says other doctors could outfit an office for less than the $25,000 he spent on technology.

“Most doctors think they need to hire two receptionists, a billing person and two nurses to run a primary care office,” he said. “But they can learn about these technologies from other doctors, and the software salespeople do some training.”

Some physicians hire consultants to find and install the right equipment. Doctors who want to switch to electronic health records may also receive financial support from the government through the stimulus package.

By using new technology and streamlining processes, small primary care practices can reduce their costs to half of what a typical practice pays, from about 60 percent of income down to 30 percent, Dr. Wasson said. He said that doctors who focus on reducing their costs can see fewer patients without sacrificing income. Dr. Sacks said she and her colleagues didn’t have to take a pay cut when they moved to Dr. Bliss’s practice.

As Congress and the Obama administration begin to focus more closely on health care, some primary care doctors are weighing in. Dr. Bliss, for instance, has been to Washington twice in the last month to share his ideas with legislators. He knows he’s in a debate with powerful voices, especially insurance companies and hospitals. So he and other doctors are encouraging patients to speak up as well.

“We need to bring the patients to the barricades with us,” Dr. Batlle says."

In Mr. Sharp’s case, someone got hold of his name and Social Security number and used them to receive emergency medical services, which many hospitals are obliged to provide whether or not a person has insurance. Mr. Sharp still does not know whether he fell victim to one calamitous perp who ended up in several emergency rooms or a ring of accident-prone conspirators.

In another variant of the crime, someone can use stolen insurance information, like the basic member ID and group policy number found on insurance cards, to impersonate you — and receive everything from a routine physical to major surgery under your coverage. This is surprisingly easy to do, because many doctors and hospitals do not ask for identification beyond insurance information.

Even more common, however, are cases where medical information is stolen by insiders at a medical office. Thieves download vital personal insurance data and related information from the operation’s computerized medical records, then sell it on the black market or use it themselves to make fraudulent billing claims.

In a widely reported case in 2006, a clerk at a Cleveland Clinic branch office in Weston, Fla., downloaded the records of more than 1,100 Medicare patients and gave the information to her cousin, who in turn, made $2.8 million in bogus claims.

When people are not aware their medical identities have been stolen, insurance companies may simply continue to pay the fraudulent claims without the victim’s knowledge. The person might learn of the fraud only when trying to make a legitimate claim, and the insurance company informs them they have reached their lifetime cap on benefits.

Or victims may eventually discover erroneous information in their medical files during a doctor or hospital visit. And that may pose a bigger danger than the financial risks. The medical records may now contain vital information like blood type, allergies, prescription drug use or a history of disease that is just plain wrong. In an emergency, doctors could treat you based on this erroneous information.

And there are none of the consumer protections for medical identity theft victims that exist for traditional identity theft. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you can get a free copy of your credit report each year, put a fraud alert on your account and get erroneous charges deleted from your record. If your credit card is stolen and the thief goes on a spending spree, you’re not liable for more than $50 worth of the charges.

With medical identity theft, though, the fraudulent charges can remain unpaid and unresolved for years, permanently damaging your credit rating. Under the federal law known as Hipaa — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — you are entitled to a copy of your medical records, but you may have to pay a hefty fee for them.

Worse, Hipaa privacy rules can actually work against you. Once your medical information is intermingled with someone else’s, you may have trouble accessing your files. Privacy laws dictate that the thief’s medical information now contained in your records must be kept confidential, too.

Even when you are able to correct a record, say in your doctor’s office, the erroneous information may have been passed on to dozens of other health care providers and insurers. Victims must track down and resolve these errors largely on a case-by-case basis, Ms. Dixon says.

Medical providers contend that they are taking precautions against identity theft. At Cleveland Clinic, for example, security personnel routinely audit electronic medical record systems and all records are password-protected. Many Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers use software to screen for spikes in claims from providers that look suspicious. They also work with providers on encrypting medical files and carrying out data access restrictions, said Calvin Sneed, senior antifraud consultant at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.

And some medical centers and doctors’ offices now require patients to show photo ID and attach photos to patient charts.

But privacy advocates worry that these steps do not go nearly far enough, especially in light of President Obama’s plans to spend $20 billion to increase the use of electronic medical records nationwide as part of the stimulus package. “Without aggressive safeguards, we could be building an infrastructure for massive medical fraud,” said Ms. Dixon."

Offers Loans for E-Health Record Purchases,4fd395a08eb7c8105d8cba72,type_of_material:News,None,0.0,None,"To accelerate the adoption of electronic health records, G.E. will offer doctors and hospitals interest-free loans and guarantee that its products will meet not-yet-determined government standards.",The New York Times,https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/ge-offers-loans-for-e-health-record-purchases/,639,"To accelerate the adoption of electronic health records, G.E. will offer doctors and hospitals interest-free loans and guarantee that its products will meet not-yet-determined government standards.","Darren Hauck for The New York Times

Clarifying G.E. comments on initial funding for health-records loan program in post and headline. While it is setting aside $2 billion for financing of health information technology, its initial commitment for loans to accelerate adoption of electronic health records is $100 million.

G.E. Capital has mostly been a headache for its parent company, General Electric, since the financial crisis hit last fall. But on Monday, the finance arm will be putting its muscle behind G.E.’s health care unit as it tries to grab a hefty slice of the market for electronic health records, a prime target for economic stimulus spending by the Obama administration.

G.E. is announcing that it will offer doctors and hospitals loans that will carry no interest until the institutions begin receiving government money, typically in 2012. The loans, of course, will be to buy G.E.’s Centricity electronic health records — either as conventional personal-computer software or as a Web-based offering.

The bridge-loan plan addresses one big worry for many doctors who are interested in taking advantage of the government incentives (up to $40,000 per physician over a few years) to make the move to digital patient records: a shortage of upfront capital.

But the other uncertainty is that the government has not yet defined the technology standards for what will be “qualified” electronic health records. The definition will presumably include being able to share data and as well as automated reporting of certain measurements of health care quality.

The details of the new standards will be crucial — and won’t be known for sure until the end of this year. To remove the technological uncertainty, G.E. is issuing a guarantee that its electronic health records will meet the government standards, regardless of the final details.

“We think this is a really good way to stimulate interest in and adoption of electronic health records,” Vishal Wanchoo, chief executive of G.E.’s health care information technology business, said in an interview on Friday.

As part of its recently announced healthymagination initiative, G.E. said $2 billion would be set aside for financing. Most of that will go to fund health information technology and rural health projects in developing nations. The initial commitment for the loans to accelerate adoption of electronic health records is $100 million.

In April, I.B.M. said it would make up to $2 billion in financing available as bridge loans to jump-start high-technology infrastructure projects likely to qualify for federal stimulus spending, including computerized health records, smart electric grids and broadband networks for rural communities. The G.E. commitment is morer tailored, focused on health care technology and comes with a warranty that its products will meet the coming federal standards.

G.E. is also making a bigger move into Web-based electronic health records. That service, Centricity ASP, has previously been offered through third-party providers, which host the service in local markets. But Mr. Wanchoo said that G.E. would also begin offering the service on its own, hosted from G.E. data centers. The price will be $250 to $500 a month per physician. The big benefit for smaller physician practices, he said, will be to remove the headaches and support troubles from their offices. And the price, Mr. Wanchoo conceded, will be carefully set so as not to cannibalize G.E.’s traditional PC-and-server health software.

That’s hardly unique to G.E. in health care. It is the same model used by most traditional software companies as they begin to offer Web-based alternatives.

But doesn’t that leave a real opening — especially in a market about to be turbo-charged by government spending — for someone to come in and undercut the old price structures with Web-based technology and Internet economics? Mr. Wanchoo smiled and paused briefly, but barely missed a beat. “We think that what we’re doing is the disruptive force that will drive adoption, by removing the financial and technology barriers,” he replied."

Updated, June 18, 8 p.m. | Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute joins the discussion and points out that private insurers have had success in giving patients incentives to stay healthy.

President Obama spoke to the American Medical Association this week to assure doctors that changes in health care would help them better serve patients. Many studies have shown that patient care and spending vary enormously from community to community, depending on local practices, which are largely determined by doctors.

The health care system has long been accused of emphasizing the quantity — rather than the quality — of care, giving doctors and other health providers incentive to order extra tests and procedures when they don’t improve the outcome. “It is a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession — a calling — to a business,” President Obama said of the system.

What changes in the system would realign incentives for doctors? Can that be done without significantly altering the way doctors are compensated?

Share Savings With Doctors

Elliott S. Fisher, a professor of medicine, is director of the Center for Health Policy Research at Dartmouth Medical School.

There are huge regional variations in health care spending and in the growth of health care costs. Yet low-spending regions are able to provide care that is as good or better than that in high-spending regions. That fact raises the possibility of substantial savings — of perhaps more than 30 percent.

But we can’t fix the problem — and may make it worse — by focusing just on prices. Some services are clearly overpaid, but cutting prices to high-cost regions will only cause providers in those regions to deliver more services.

The problem of the ‘partialist’ physician, who focuses on a tiny part of a patient’s care.

The regional differences are largely due to how much care is being provided. Where the evidence for a treatment is strong — like some treatments for heart attacks or heartburn — higher and lower spending regions are almost equally likely to get the right care to the right patient. (If anything, patients in higher spending regions are less likely to get these treatments).

Almost all of the extra spending in high-cost regions is from greater use of “discretionary” treatments — like how frequently similar patients see their physician (once a month or every six months?), how often they are referred to specialists, whether they are cared for in a hospital or as an outpatient, and how many tests and minor procedures they receive. Yet the outcomes for patients are no better for all the extra care.

Read more… An underlying cause of this overuse is a fragmented and uncoordinated health care system where each physician only focuses on a tiny piece of the patient’s care. Most physicians, even those in primary care, have become “partialists.” And the payment system that rewards overuse by physicians and encourages hospitals to compete in a local medical arms race to offer every possible profitable service. We need to foster the development of more organized systems that are responsible and accountable for the overall costs of care experienced by their patients. Some health systems like Kaiser Permanente and Geisinger are already fully integrated and represent one possible approach. But physicians in many communities — Grand Junction, Colo.; Green Bay, Wis., for example — have come together in networks that provide some common resources that help the physicians work together effectively. We also need to pay them differently. One approach that has shown some early promise is to combine the fee-for-service with “quality bonuses” and “shared savings” payments when they reduce spending growth for all of their patients. Doctors, hospitals and society should realize that slowing spending growth would not require dramatic cuts in income under a system where providers would be rewarded for better care, not just more care.

Forced Into Running a Business

Kevin Pho, a primary care doctor in Nashua, N.H., blogs at KevinMD.com.

In his address to the American Medical Association, President Obama noted that our health care system “rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care.” This perverse incentive leads to unnecessary and potentially harmful medicine, while also being a major contributor to spiraling health care costs.

Physician payments need to be divorced from the volume of care.

Doctors enter the profession to care for patients. Most are not trained, or have the inclination, to run a business. But our health system’s incentives provide a strong motivation to do just that. In fact, doctors often find themselves in a position where the pressure to generate revenue becomes as important as how they practice medicine, and those who do not pay close attention to the financial bottom line are at a competitive disadvantage. It is no wonder that both physicians and patients are growing disenchanted with the current direction of American health care.

Read more… Some health policy analysts blame the medical profession entirely for the role they play in rising health care spending. And indeed, doctors have tremendous influence in the tests being ordered and treatments prescribed. But singling out physicians would be like blaming the players for a proverbial game’s flawed rules. More important than focusing on the players, we need to change the rules. Physician payments need to be divorced from the volume of care and instead associated with evidence-based quality measures and a reduction in medical errors. We need to value the time doctors spend with patients. Instead of being encouraged to squeeze in appointments and rush through office visits, doctors should be “incentivized” to take the time to counsel and guide, along with improving their communication with patients, not only in person, but over the phone and on the Internet.

End Insurance’s Bad Incentives

Steffie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein are associate professors of medicine at Harvard Medical School, primary care doctors in Cambridge, Mass., and co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program.

There are a variety of bad ways of paying doctors, but no particularly good ones. Fee-for-service health care rewards the overprovision of care; capitation (a set monthly fee per patient) rewards underprovision; and salaries reward just showing up. The minority of physicians (and hospital administrators) who are motivated mostly by money will find a way to game an incentive system rather than do the hard work of providing excellent care.

Even paying doctors based on quality measures (using data from medical records that the doctors themselves create) can be fudged. For example, if you pay doctors more for care of patients with diabetes with extra incentives for controlling blood sugar, some doctors will neglect to properly instruct patients to fast before their morning blood tests, falsely diagnosing them as ill. These false diabetics will appear to have superb outcomes since they weren’t sick to begin with.

At the same time, most of the myriad details of care and small kindnesses that make for good doctoring would inevitably go unrewarded, making their neglect essential to a doctor’s financial success.

Read more… A public plan would be forced to emulate the bad behavior of private insurance competitors, or fail in the marketplace. The Medicare payment system illustrates the false hope of financial savings or improved quality through manipulating financial incentives. The system, which pays health care providers based on “diagnosis-related group,” altered hospitals’ incentives, rewarding short hospital stays instead of long ones. But hospitals quickly adapted, and while Medicare patients’ length of stay plummeted, costs continued to skyrocket. Financial incentives are not necessary for cost control, and are expensive to administer. A single payer system like Canada’s -– in which individuals choose their doctors and other health care providers, but the providers bill one agency for their services — limits entrepreneurial rewards and penalties, covers everyone, and saves much on bureaucracy and profits. Many American doctors now support a single payer approach because it would improve health and remove the crushing paperwork burden that private insurers impose. Paperwork consumes 31 percent of U.S. health spending, nearly double that of Canada. Our nation wastes $400 billion annually on insurance overhead and useless bureaucracy, money that single-payer reform could shift to patient care. That’s enough to cover all of the uninsured, and to eliminate copayments and deductibles for everyone else. A single payer system would allow doctors to return to the patient-centered care that motivated us to go to medical school in the first place. In contrast, the Senate Democrats’ proposal to require the purchase of coverage would leave private insurers in charge, and hence sharply increase costs while leaving millions uninsured, or covered by skimpy policies. In 2007, illness and medical bills contributed to 62 percent of personal bankruptcies; most of the medically bankrupt were middle-class families with private insurance. Copayments, deductibles, and loopholes that let insurers deny claims leave millions of Americans in financial ruin. The individual mandate now popular in Congress would merely force the uninsured to buy defective policies – boosting revenues for insurers but not protecting patients. Unfortunately, adding a public plan option would not correct these flaws. The bureaucratic savings would be minuscule. Moreover, a public plan would be forced to either emulate the bad behavior of its private insurance competitors, or fail in the marketplace — swamped by private insurers that dumped sick, expensive patients onto the public. This kind of tinkering around the edges of our insurance company-dominated system won’t fix it.

Coordinated Care

J. James Rohack, a practicing cardiologist in Texas, is the president of the American Medical Association.

President Obama received a standing ovation in his address to the American Medical Association on Monday when he said that “you did not enter this profession to be bean-counters and paper-pushers. You entered this profession to be healers, and that’s what our health care system should let you be.”

Medical liability reform is also needed.

Physicians want to spend more time with patients and focus on not just treating disease, but preventing it in the first place. To do this, physicians should be offered incentives to work with each other and other health care providers to coordinate care and to invest the time and resources needed to truly manage chronic disease.

New models of care like the medical home, where patients have one physician coordinate care across many specialties and settings, benefits patients and rewards doctors for focusing on aspects of care that are vital but less tangible than procedures. This is the type of care physicians want to provide and patients want to get.

Read more… To that end, the A.M.A. passed new policy this week at its annual meeting to provide recommendations on emerging alternative physician payment methods that focus on care coordination and quality. Now, Congress needs to reform the Medicare physician payment system that everyone says is broken as an essential first step toward health care that is coordinated among disciplines and focused on prevention and wellness. Medical liability reform is also needed, and President Obama has recognized that defensive medicine contributes to unnecessary health care costs. Until physicians no longer fear lawsuits if they don’t order every test to rule out every possible option, defensive medicine will continue. We are heartened that the president has expressed openness to medical liability reforms as part of health care reform. Bottom line: The relationship between the patient and physician is the heart of health care, and reforms must preserve and strengthen that relationship so that people can get the care they need and the care they desire.

Operating in Silos

Clive Callender, a specialist in organ transplant medicine, is founder and director of Howard University Hospital’s Transplant Center and former chairman of Howard University College Of Medicine’s Department of Surgery. He recently joined other health care experts invited to the White House to discuss health care reform.

In my experience, incentives in health care tend to flow to health care providers and not to patients. That needs to change. Providers should offer coordinated care to patients as a team rather than operating in silos. This is especially true in managing chronic disease.

A team approach yields savings by preventing unnecessary services.

As a transplant surgeon treating a patient with end-stage renal disease, I recently acted as the care coordinator for my patient’s treatment. I interacted with several other health care providers responsible for the patient’s care, from the urologist, to the primary care physician, to the cardiologist. I got the benefit of their perspectives as I made treatment decisions related to my area of specialty.

The goal of the team approach is to optimize patient care, but it can also yield savings by preventing overtesting and other unnecessary services. Doctors who aren’t talking to each other might end up duplicating efforts. I find that a team or holistic approach not only allows for better monitoring of the patient, it also provides increased opportunities for consultation among medical professionals and better decision-making.

Read more… In renal transplants, in recent years, payments for transplants have been bundled. Under this system, physicians aren’t reimbursed for specific tests or services, there is just one payment for the transplant as a whole. I don’t believe this approach has changed the quality of care patients receive. It has not changed how I practice or the level of care patients generally receive. But such a system does take away any incentive to do more simply to do more. Besides team-based care, we need to give patients better access to their own medical records and information about the cost of their care. For instance, all test results should go to the patient and the health care provider simultaneously. More transparency may help reduce duplication of tests and further trim costs.

Shift Pay Away From Specialists

Liam Yore is an emergency room doctor in suburban Seattle and administrator of a medical group practice. He is the author of the blog Movin’ Meat, which focuses on the practice of emergency medicine and health policy.

In a recent New Yorker article, Atul Gawande vividly illustrated one of the greatest fiscal threats to American health care: over-utilization. Dr. Gawande and others, including President Obama, have blamed this practice of over-utilization of medical services on physicians and their traditional “fee-for-service” compensation model, which is thought to create a perverse incentive for physicians to do more than is actually needed, since the more care they provide, the more money they get.

What we need to do is rebalance physician compensation away from procedures and toward primary care.

In this, they are half right: over-utilization is a driver of cost, and it is in part driven by doctors’ economic incentives. The underlying cause, however, is a bias within the physician compensation system that extravagantly rewards surgical procedures performed compared to “cognitive” services like diagnosis and medical management.

In the E.R., for example, sewing a facial laceration pays far better than accurately diagnosing a heart attack. The same principle applies to any procedure — from angiograms to colonoscopies.

Read more… The predictable consequence is that physicians gravitate toward lucrative procedural specialties. They perform more and more procedures, using expensive new technologies, driving costs ever higher. Meanwhile, office-based primary care doctors struggle. The compensation for an office visit is a tiny fraction of that for the simplest procedures. The family physician must rush from patient to patient just to keep pace with static or diminishing reimbursement. Fewer and fewer medical students are going into primary care. What we need to do is rebalance physician compensation away from procedures and toward primary care. Surgeons can easily earn three to five times the average salary of a family doctor. The compensation for surgical procedures should be reduced, and the savings realized should be applied toward increasing pay for primary care physicians. Better-compensated primary care specialties would attract more doctors who would be able to spend more time with their patients. They would require fewer expensive diagnostic tests like M.R.I.’s and rely less on specialists. Accordingly, the use of expensive and invasive procedures would decline. Prevention, wellness and chronic disease management would be encouraged: enhancing quality and patient satisfaction, but at a far lower cost. Primary care is the linchpin to successful health care reform. Ignore it, and reform will fail. Make it an appealing career choice, and the odds of success increase greatly.

Good Ideas From Private Insurers

Grace-Marie Turner is president of the Galen Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on free-market ideas in the health sector.

Much of the unnecessary spending on health care in the United States -– as much as 30 percent -– could be eliminated if doctors, patients, hospitals, and other providers had more and better information about care management.

For example, the great majority of seniors on Medicare are in fee-for-service programs that bounce them from doctor to doctor and even from nursing homes to hospitals with little coordination of care. They get duplicate tests, may take multiple versions of the same drug prescribed by different doctors, and get little guidance on managing their own care. The system pays more for worse care because no one has any incentive to check spending."

The group’s effort begins with a Web site, HealthDataRights.org, which goes live on Monday night. And it is a bottom-up endeavor to harness the power of social media to influence policy and practice as personal medical information begins a years-long journey from paper records into the Internet age.

The early supporters all share the view that informed, motivated patients must play a much greater role in managing their own health if the policy goals of improving the quality of care and curbing costs are to be achieved. And, they add, health information technology, when used wisely, can help a lot. The endorsers include Web sites and personal health startups geared to advancing consumer-driven health care and helping patients learn about and manage their own health, including PatientsLikeMe.com, DiabetesMine.com and 23AndMe.

The new Web-based push comes a week after the Obama administration published a “preamble” document outlining the goals for electronic health records and the broad criteria for their “meaningful use” to qualify for incentive payments to doctors and hospitals. The administration document declared that its “ultimate vision” is one in which “all patients are fully engaged in their health care,” while physicians and clinics have real-time access to all the medical information they need to ensure the quality and safety of care.

The administration’s statement of goals is encouraging, but more needs to be done, said Adam Bosworth, the former head of Google’s health unit and founder of an online health startup, Keas, which has not yet begun operating. He is one of the people who helped orchestrate the patients rights initiative.

The group’s declaration of “health data rights” states that individuals should have: the right to their own medical information; the right to know the source of each element of information; the right to take a complete copy of their health information; and the right to share their health data with others as they see fit.

The government’s current law governing health information, HIPAA, for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, appears to address these issues, but it does not, Mr. Bosworth said. The existing rules, he said, were forged without the digitization of personal health information in mind and tailored mainly for doctor-to-doctor communication.

The health data-rights group, Mr. Bosworth said, intends to issue “badges” or “seals of approval” for health care providers that sign up for and support the patients data rights principles. And, he said, the group also wants to draw attention to providers who do not allow patients to control their own health data.

“We want to use the power of the community and the bloggers to build public momentum to bring this change,” Mr. Bosworth said. “We’re finally talking seriously about changing health care in this country. And enabling patients to control their own information and take a more active role in managing their own health has to be a huge part of the solution.”"

Here’s the first batch of answers.,"Health care reform is a big, nasty, complicated, sensitive subject. And everybody wants something different out of it.

So, in the spirit of our “Ideal Stimulus Package” collection, we decided to compile ideas about what the American health care system should look like.

We asked all sorts of experts and stakeholders to answer this question: What should the priorities for health care reform be?

We will be running their responses in loosely themed batches throughout the day. The first batch — about consumers, patients and workers — is below. Find other proposals from doctors, businesses, biotech investors, insurance companies, tax and public finance experts and more here.

Improve Health, Not the Health Care System

Dana P. Goldman is chairman and director of health economics, finance and organization at the RAND Corporation. He is also a professor at U.C.L.A.

One reason that health reform proposals always seem to fail is that proponents promise too much. Reformers declare they will improve quality, lower costs and increase access — all at the same time. This mantra is repeated so often — on both sides of the ideological divide — that the public tends to believe it is possible, when really it isn’t.

I want to suggest a new priority — improve health, not the health care system.

This may sound like a parsing exercise, but it is not. Consider the evidence. Many of the greatest improvements in health during the last century had little to do with the health care system. Clean water, public sanitation and reduced smoking all reflect public health interventions that had dramatic benefits.

Read more… “Many of the greatest improvements in health during the last century had little to do with the health care system.” Cardiovascular disease is another good example. Between 1980 to 2000, the death rate for coronary heart disease was cut in half. But only about half of this reduction came from better medical therapies. The rest — lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, less smoking, and other factors — came from better behavior and some drugs. And treatment of heart disease is one of our greatest success stories. Our accomplishments in diabetes, cancer and lung disease are not nearly as impressive. So good health is only partially a story about excellent health care. Advocates of universal coverage often get confused on this point. They equate good health with having health insurance, and cite myriad academic studies. The problem is that these studies don’t account for all the other differences between the insured and uninsured — what they eat, where they live, whether they smoke or drink, the amount of stress in their lives, and even their genetic predisposition to disease. No health care system is good enough to fully compensate for bad behavior and poor environmental factors. With a growing elderly population — and a larger baby boom generation approaching retirement — the prevalence of chronic diseases will rise. If current trends continue, health care costs will consume an ever-increasing share of national income. The future liability of the Medicare program alone is estimated to be $24 trillion over the next 75 years, absent any policy changes. So what can we do? Well, the first step is to invest, not in the health care system, but in education. We should take the $120 billion it might cost for universal coverage, and use it to provide earlier education and to improve the quality of education. Better educated people live longer, are less likely to be disabled, and engage in healthier behavior. They also are better at self-managing their chronic disease. And, unlike universal coverage, more education has other valuable benefits to a person and society. Less crime, less divorce and higher earnings — can universal health insurance promise that? The second place to invest is prevention. Primary prevention has the capacity to slow or reduce the rising prevalence of chronic disease, and simultaneously attenuate the downstream spending associated with it. Equally importantly, however, prevention leads to a life with less disability and more years of an active lifestyle. It just makes a lot of sense to avoid disease in the first place, rather than try to treat it later. There are also sound economic arguments for a strong government role to prevent disease. Because the benefits of prevention often accrue decades later — long after someone has switched employers or health plans — private plans will skimp on prevention coverage. The government needs to step in to fill this void. Medicare could save itself money, for example, by paying for anti-hypertensive medication before people turn 65. Perhaps most strikingly, my colleagues and I estimate that if we could roll back obesity to levels seen in the 1980s, we could save up to $1 trillion. We need to find a way to make this happen. One way may involve better medicine — an obesity pill — but it may mean other methods having little to do with health care. Maybe it is an extra hour of physical education at school, or subsidized treadmills in the workplace, or even pedometers for all Americans. Clearly there would be huge returns to a substantial investment to combat obesity. It is time for us to put the priority on health, not health care.

Insure Long-Term Care

Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

I used to worry more about getting sick than getting old, but of course the two are closely related.

When people talk about health insurance, they’re usually referring to acute-care insurance — as in, who will pay for your open-heart surgery. But what about long-term assistance for individuals dealing with chronic illness like congestive heart failure? Along with disabled children and adults, many of the elderly need assistance to live on their own. Without such assistance they often land in expensive and sometimes even unhealthy nursing homes.

“Most married men already have insurance to help cope with the frailties of old age. It’s called a wife.”

Medicare generally doesn’t pay for long-term care. Medicaid, a means-tested program available only to low-income individuals, pays only if assets are spent down below a $2,000 limit. Financed by states and the federal government, it directs far more resources to nursing homes than to home and community-based services.

Read more… Medicaid paid for about one-half of the nation’s long-term care expenditures in 2004, and many states are reeling under the budgetary pressure, especially during the current recession. You can buy long-term care insurance on your own, but it costs a fortune, and warnings are written all over the package. As Consumer Reports points out — and recent Congressional hearings confirm — many policies appear complex and risky. Only about 10 percent of seniors have purchased them. Elderly women, in particular, would benefit from reform of our long-term care system. Most married men already have insurance to help cope with the frailties of old age. It’s called a wife. If you marry someone who is both older and has a shorter life expectancy than you — as most women do — you are left vulnerable. About 75 percent of nursing home residents and about 67 percent of home health care users are women. Women also represent the majority of caregivers. Heavily concentrated in direct care jobs, they often earn less than men with comparable skills in other occupations. As unpaid care providers they are often forced to take time out of paid employment, with harmful consequences for their own long-term economic welfare. Several long-term care initiatives are now under debate in Congress as part of health care reform. The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) Act of 2009 introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy enjoys support from many groups and represents a politically pragmatic approach, emphasizing personal choice and leaving plenty of scope for the private insurance business. Individuals would be automatically enrolled unless they opt out of paying the premium of about $65 a month that would finance the benefits. Cash benefits would go directly to individuals needing assistance with activities of daily living, giving them the flexibility to support family caregivers as well as to purchase the services they need. The costs to taxpayers are difficult to estimate, but the program would certainly address many of the problems described above. Here’s the down side. Many younger workers (especially men) might opt out, leaving a gaping hole in revenue projections (hence the difficulty of estimating costs to taxpayers). The benefits offered, limited to $100 a day for the most serious level of disability, might not be adequate for many, like victims of Alzheimer’s disease. Affluent consumers will be expected to purchase supplemental private insurance. What’s the alternative? Universal public long-term care insurance. German policies in this area once resembled our own, but in 1994 Germnay shifted to a long-term-care program financed by a dedicated tax (somewhat like our Medicare system) that provides generous support for home and community-based care. It’s a cost-effective program that enjoys considerable political support from voters. We would need to adapt such a program to our institutional environment and think carefully about its budgetary implications. But something along these lines should go on the table along with other proposed health care reforms. It could potentially improve the efficiency of our overall health care system and make many of us feel better about growing old.

Lower Costs for Working Families

John Sweeney is president of the 11-million-member A.F.L.-C.I.O., the umbrella organization of the labor movement.

Behind all the rhetoric, poll-tested language and political brinkmanship of the health care debate is the real desire of families to be able to get the care they need, from a physician of their choice, at a price they can afford.

It is just that simple for families who have seen their wages stagnate and their budgets undermined by the rising costs of health care — costs generated by a dysfunctional and unsustainable health insurance system. Working families need Congressional action to assure quality and affordable care, and they need it now.

Some will say we can’t fix health care until the economy is back on its feet again. But in fact, it’s more the other way around.

Read more… Excessively high health care costs are a drag on economic recovery as working families put more and more money into health care instead of consumer purchases. Working people are falling further and further behind and too many wind up bankrupt when they’re sick — the leading root cause of personal bankruptcy in our nation is a major health care crisis. Meanwhile, companies that provide adequate employee health care benefits are at a severe competitive disadvantage against companies that do not. “Some will say we can’t fix health care until the economy is back on its feet again. But in fact, it’s more the other way around.” We simply will not be able to fix our economy for the long term until we fix our health care system. So what should health care reform look like? We have heard it repeatedly: We must lower health care costs in order to provide affordable options for families. Lower costs will go a long way toward expanding access to more people and relieving the pocketbook pressures on even those with insurance. Our current system is unaffordable. With a system with a price tag of $2.3 trillion a year, we are spending more and more money and getting less and less health care for our dollars. This model is shutting people out of the system: people like Karen from Florida, who recently told of an insurance deductible that equals four to five months of her take-home pay each year even though her insurance bill is split with her employer. Karen feels she can’t even afford to see a doctor. Health care providers have to do their part to eliminate inequities in health care and all employers must be required to pay their fair share. Changing the way we pay for health care must also be a part of the solution. We cannot continue to pay for expensive technology and treatments that have no evidence of effectiveness. Health care providers should be compensated for the quality – and not the quantity – of health care they deliver. As the technology revolution continues to sweep our country and change the way we communicate, our health care system has fallen behind. We must streamline and modernize the way we access medical records and eliminate inefficiencies and flaws in the system that cost money and cost lives. Despite protests by those who offer no solutions, it is clear that government must have a role in controlling costs and regulating private insurance. We need a quality public insurance plan option that will end the dominance and price-gouging of private insurers. The public is demanding it. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll confirms that 76 percent of the public wants a quality public health care option. It is time we heed the advice of those we are trying to help. It’s hard, but we are closer than ever to achieving quality, affordable health care for everyone. We must not let the momentum languish or get caught up in the rhetoric of naysayers who would prefer to continue the status quo. We owe it to families who work hard every day and who deserve health care that works for everyone.

Ways to Put the Consumer First

Jim Guest is president and chief executive of Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine and ConsumerReports.org.

Medical costs are soaring at twice the rate of inflation. Even if you don’t pay the bills directly, you see the increase in higher insurance premiums, deductibles and co-pays.

And what are you getting for your money? A system that often limits your choices of doctors and hospitals, fails to cover needed services, forces you to satisfy a complex web of rules to get reimbursed, locks you into a job for fear of losing coverage, and strands you without affordable protection if you lose insurance after experiencing health problems, sometimes even minor ones.

Read more… Tackling the enormous cost of health care must be a top priority of any reform plan. Unless costs are controlled, we will face a “death spiral” where more and more Americans will be unable to afford coverage, more healthy people will roll the dice of going without coverage leaving only those with health problems in the insurance pool, thus further raising the cost of coverage. Providers who treat growing numbers of uninsured who need care but can’t pay for it (and are often much sicker because they delayed seeking care) will recover those costs through higher charges for those who have insurance. So the cost spiral continues upward, with dire consequences for individuals, families and our whole economy. “What are you getting for your money? A system that often limits your choices of doctors and hospitals, fails to cover needed services, forces you to satisfy a complex web of rules to get reimbursed, locks you into a job for fear of losing coverage, and strands you without affordable protection if you lose insurance after experiencing health problems, sometimes even minor ones.” In a system as large and complex as ours there is no single silver bullet. But it’s widely acknowledged that health care can become more affordable, and better, without restricting needed care. To do so, several changes are essential. First, everyone should be covered so they get preventive services as well as protection from financial devastation from a major health problem. Covering everyone would spread the costs of insurance (which is, after all, the purpose of insurance) across a larger, healthier pool. Second, doctors and other providers should be paid to work together to help us stay healthy, not for piecemeal services that are frequently uncoordinated, duplicative, ineffective and sometimes even harmful. This would go a long way in addressing the biggest cost driver today: chronic illnesses, which account for about 75 percent of health costs in the United States. Third, health insurers and providers should have incentives to compete on what’s really important: the cost and quality of care. That’s far from the case today, when consumers lack information needed to make the best choices of health plans, doctors, hospitals and treatment options. For the marketplace to work, we must have better information to compare. The health insurance exchange being considered would organize information so consumers can see how health plans compare on quality measures and apples-to-apples costs — but that requires standard data and health information technology. Better comparative information on what treatments work best is also vitally needed so doctors have the best science-based information to help decide how to treat us. The availability of a public insurance option alongside private plans is critical to keeping costs down. Opponents of reform paint the public insurance option as a government “takeover” of health care. Not true. It would be another insurer that uses the same providers as private insurance plans to deliver care. You would still have the option to keep your private insurer, but there would be more choices. Increased competition would improve quality and cost, and bring real choices to the many markets now dominated by just one or two private carriers. Fixing health care will take hard work by many and some degree of sacrifice by all. But Americans have faced, and conquered, bigger challenges in the past. We must act now, or pay a devastating price in cost and quality in the future.

Six Goals to Fix a Broken System

Jennie Chin Hansen is president of the AARP.

The nation’s broken health care system has finally reached the top of the domestic agenda, and lawmakers are working feverishly to write legislation that will finally fix it.

Affordable health care choices for all Americans must be the goal. Yet this basic necessity is increasingly out of reach, and the recession has made a serious problem worse as workers lose their benefits and prices continue to rise.

More than seven million Americans ages 50 to 64 have no health insurance, usually because they cannot afford it. They are asked to pay far higher premiums, just because of their age, or they’re rejected outright because of their medical history."
71,804,2009-07-01T00:00:00Z,article,Panel Suggests U.S. Medical Priorities,5453775238f0d81b603ee06b,"subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, subject:Reform and Reorganization, organizations:Institute of Medicine, organizations:Health and Human Services Department, organizations:National Institutes of Health, subject:Medicine and Health",Business,0.0,Money & Policy,"The report recommended priorities for the Obama administration as it spends $1.1 billion to compare the effectiveness of drugs, medical devices, surgeries and other treatments.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/health/policy/01compare.html,788,"The report recommended priorities for the Obama administration as it spends $1.1 billion to compare the effectiveness of drugs, medical devices, surgeries and other treatments.","Supporters of comparative effectiveness reviews include many medical researchers, consumer groups, unions and insurers. They say such studies are essential to curbing the widespread use of ineffective treatments and to helping control health care costs, which totaled $2.2 trillion in 2007, or 16 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

But the effort has come under attack by critics, including some conservative commentators and medical products companies, who warn that the process could lead to inadequate treatment for some patients and even the rationing of health care. There also may be sharp Congressional debate in the weeks ahead on issues like whether a new federal entity should be created to oversee government-financed comparative research and what role private industry might play in the effort.

Dr. Sox said that medical products makers had a “muted” response to the panel’s efforts, including its call for public comments and recommendations on what should receive financing for comparativeness reviews. Of the approximately 2,000 recommendations the panel received, only 28 came from makers of medical devices, drugs or biologic products, he said.

While medical products manufacturers pay for clinical trials of their own products, such studies often compare a drug or device’s effectiveness in treating an illness against a placebo or no treatment, rather than against a competing product or treatment. In addition, people selected for clinical trials often do not represent the many different types of patients who will receive a drug or device after it is approved by federal regulators for sale.

In many areas of medicine, there is frequently more than one treatment with no clear winner. To treat prostate cancer, for example, a patient is faced with strategies ranging from watchful waiting to surgery to the use of radioactive implants.

A similar conundrum faces patients diagnosed with abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. In such cases, a doctor may recommend drugs or a surgical procedure known as ablation, with little evidence as to which strategy works better or has fewer side effects.

The Institute of Medicine panel said studying both those conditions should be among the top priorities.

The panel, composed of doctors, health care experts and consumers, was convened at the request of Congress. Its recommendations are expected to have an impact on how some of $1.1 billion initially allotted by lawmakers for comparative effectiveness research is spent.

Along with recommending 100 health areas for comparative effectiveness reviews, the panel’s report focused heavily on setting up systems for collecting the data to undertake such studies and ensuring that such information is clearly communicated to patients. The panel also urged that the government subsidize the training of a new generation of researchers skilled in doing comparative effectiveness reviews.

While most of health areas cited by the panel involved medical treatments, others included topics like the best way to reduce hospital-based infections or to compare the effectiveness of differing medical imaging technologies.

Some of the panel’s recommendations also involved social or preventative issues that could generate controversy among industry or interest groups. For example, the panel urged that researchers look at the effectiveness of school programs to reduce childhood obesity through means like bans on vending machines. It also recommended research to determine the programs most effective in reducing unwanted pregnancies, including the free distribution of contraceptives.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Dr. Sox, the medical journal editor, said that based on public comments, the panel had decided it was important to look at such public health issues."

The most closely watched part of the announcement will be further definition of what the economic stimulus legislation called the “meaningful use” of digital health records.

Justin Ide/Harvard University News Office

The draft due Thursday from the office of the national information technology coordinator, Dr. David Blumenthal, will not be the final word. There will be time for public comment, and lobbying, until the end of the year.

But the work done so far by Dr. Blumenthal and his team, health experts say, is encouraging. The tentative plan, they say, calls for a requirement that physicians and clinics be able to first report health quality measures, like blood pressure and cholesterol levels of patients. Then, step by step, year by year, the administration foresees moving health providers from electronic reporting to being reimbursed for better health outcomes, such as a higher percentage of a doctor’s diabetes patients keeping their blood sugar levels at recommended levels.

The technology approach, health experts say, is pretty much agnostic. The focus is not on a specific technological path but on using computing tools to capture, track and monitor data.

While the government rules for electronic heath records are being debated, an ambitious experiment in “meaningful use” is being announced Monday in Texas.

Cook Children’s Health Care System, based in Fort Worth, is taking a comprehensive step toward the digital future championed by the Obama administration. The pediatric provider, with 350 employed physicians, plans to install Web-based electronic health records and data integration technology at its 60 offices and clinics throughout Texas. It is also offering personal health records, controlled by the families of its young patients, that can follow them throughout their lifetimes.

The Web-based health records will be supplied by AthenaHealth, while the data integration software and personal health records will come from Microsoft.

The most intriguing thing Cook Children’s has planned is probably its prototype Innovation Clinic. It will be a small physician office, with two or three doctors. Small practices are the biggest challenge for electronic health-record adoption, since they cannot afford full-time technical helpers. The 2,000 to 3,000 patients will be from Medicaid families — lower-income homes where chronic health problems are most common.

The clinic, said Ryan Champlin, vice president of operations for Cook Children’s, will emphasize family engagement and preventive care. And the reimbursement, he said, will be capitated payment — a set annual payment for each patient, instead of the standard fee-for-service system of American health care.

Cook Children’s is betting that the new technology will help the clinic improve care management and curb costs, which is the outcome-oriented approach that the administration seeks. “We’re hopeful that we can help the administration see a pilot that can be replicated in other cities,” Mr. Champlin said.

Wes Rishel, a health analyst at Gartner, called the Cook Children’s program “experimental but promising.” He added, “The focus on patient and family engagement is impressive, and that’s going to have to be a huge part of health care reform.”"

Miller accidentally put some of the mental health files relating to the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, in a box he packed with his personal documents, according to a statement released by Dr. Miller’s lawyer, Edward J. McNelis III.

Little could have prepared me for what I saw when Marla opened her gown. While the right side of her chest was unremarkable, her left breast was the size of a young child’s head. The skin was stretched thin, and I could see an outline of the tumor within. That tumor was so large and so heavy that it seemed to pull the rest of her body down. Marla hunched over oddly and cradled her left arm not out of habit but to support the weight of the cancer within her breast.

We admitted Marla immediately to the hospital and removed her cancer the next day. Fortunately, the tumor was not an aggressive one, but her operation was far more extensive and fraught with risks than it would have been two years earlier. And as much as I liked Marla personally and enjoyed our conversations, I was also frustrated that she hadn’t come forth sooner with some doctor about her cancer.

Marla was not the first patient I had seen who had waited until her cancer was advanced before seeing the doctor. But I have learned over the years that while my initial reaction is always to question if I or any other doctor missed the diagnosis, the situation is not always so cut and dry. While I need to understand and respect the beliefs of my patients, I still can’t escape feeling a certain level of responsibility as a doctor. I find myself wondering when it comes to patients like Marla or others whose diagnoses are delayed for various personal, social and economic reasons, how responsible am I as the physician and are they as the patients?

Diagnostic failures, or diagnoses that are delayed or in error, are an increasingly popular topic of research in patient safety. While some researchers have focused on the role of doctors — are there flaws in the way they think? are “gut reactions” reliable? — others have looked at the steps involved in care, or the process of care. What has emerged most recently from this latter group of studies is that diagnostic failures are often due to missed steps, so-called “process of care lapses,” that stem from both doctors and patients.

In the June issue of The Journal of General Internal Medicine, for example, investigators from Harvard Medical School studied the records of over 100 women with breast cancer diagnosed late or at advanced stages and found that roughly a quarter of patients had experienced process of care lapses. Examples of such lapses included inadequate physical exams, delayed physician involvement and incomplete diagnostic and laboratory tests. But while the investigators discovered that nearly 20 percent of the women were missing as many as two or more steps in their care, they also found that doctors and patients contributed equally to the resulting diagnostic failures.

“Clearly we found that about half of the process failures were due to something the patient did,” said Dr. Saul N. Weingart, lead author of the study and a practicing internist and vice-president of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “These patients missed their mammogram appointments or never went to see the specialists their primary care physicians had recommended.”

To address these lapses, experts in the field of patient safety like Dr. Weingart have proposed a variety of strategies to strengthen patient follow-up. One strategy that many physicians already use in one form or another is a “tickler system,” electronic or paper reminders to check that diagnostic testing or referrals are completed. Other ways include implementing a type of technology that allows physicians to check specific tests across their entire practice, or panel, on a monthly basis. With “the push of a button,” a doctor can see which patients have not yet followed through, for example, on their mammogram appointments.

And perhaps just as important as any technological change is one that involves transforming deep-rooted practice patterns. “It’s not part of practices now,” Dr. Weingart said, “but you can imagine creating an expectation among the medical community where if patients don’t go, the referring doctors or practices will notify you.”

But there are hidden obstacles in care as well. When Dr. Weingart and his co-investigators looked more closely at the group of individuals who had experienced lapses, they found that many were patients who were particularly vulnerable: they were minorities, possessed less education and came from challenging socioeconomic backgrounds, all of which contributed to practical obstacles or poor health literacy.

These findings “suggest that there are some intangible barriers,” Dr. Weingart remarked. “Perhaps these patients don’t know how to access care, need an interpreter, live farther away, or may be overwhelmed by family responsibilities. All of these factors are distractions for a patient and make getting care all that much harder.”

In order to address these intangible barriers, Dr. Weingart suggested that “we need to develop not only risk assessment tools but also services geared toward patient vulnerabilities.” But given that many physician practices, particularly those in the community, are already overstretched, organizing and maintaining such services may be close to or simply impossible. “Often when I talk to community practices about these findings,” Dr. Weingart added, “the doctors will tell me that they can only do so much. When a patient doesn’t show up, do I have to track him or her down? How many letters do I have to send the patient? What constitutes due diligence?”

How much responsibility, then, do doctors — and patients — bear in diagnostic failures?

“I don’t think it’s 50-50,” Dr. Weingart reflected, “and I also don’t think it’s 100-zero. I think there’s a shared responsibility. But given that the patients who fall through the cracks are usually the least resourceful and most vulnerable, there is at least a moral obligation for clinicians and health care systems to provide a robust safety net for these patients.

“I think we physicians need to support patient responsibility, but we also need to get our own house in order first. In terms of process failures, we need to make sure that the current system under health care providers is airtight. After we get that figured out, we then need to think about ways to help our patients do what they need to do.”

The monthlong program is elective, but a record number of students took part this year — 117 from a class of 216.

The school has a cooperative agreement to train medical students from Alaska, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, none of which has a medical college of its own. The summer program is one of several vehicles, along with loan forgiveness enticements, designed to lure students back to their home states to practice in areas with a shortage of primary care givers.

This year, the students set out as negotiations were intensifying in Washington over wholesale changes to the health care system they will soon be joining. Whether there will be improvements to the system remains to be seen, but few students returned thinking there was little to fix.

Payment policies that leave primary care providers struggling to cover their costs have pushed family practitioners and internists into early retirement, and discouraged newly minted doctors from replacing them. To make a living, and chip away at immense educational debt, general practitioners often find they must churn patients and work long, unsatisfying hours.

The result is that only a third of today’s graduates of American medical schools train in internal or family medicine, the two largest primary care disciplines, compared with nearly half only 25 years ago, according to the National Resident Matching Program, which matches medical school graduates with residency openings. The figure at the University of Washington, despite a persistent emphasis on primary care, is only slightly higher.

For some students, like Mr. Opfer, 23, their summer experience persuaded them that primary care was not for them. The three pediatricians Mr. Opfer followed, who ran the only children’s clinic in Gillette, filled their 13-hour days with hospital rounds and staccato five-minute appointments, he said. One was about to retire because of burnout.

Mr. Opfer said he thought that the lifestyle would be too harsh to raise a family, and that it would take many years to pay off his anticipated medical school debt of at least $120,000.

“I don’t think you can practice optimal medicine,” Mr. Opfer said. “There is too little incentive after going through all this education and being in school for the majority of your life to want to pursue a career just in primary care.”

Other students, like Kylie G. Boggess, 24, witnessed how integral a federally qualified health center could be to a community like Nampa, Idaho, and became all the more committed. “This just sold it to me,” Ms. Boggess said. “You get to have a very personal relationship with your patients. You get to know them.”

Nonetheless, Ms. Boggess, who is from Twin Falls, Idaho, said she had been struck by how much time was devoted to scavenging resources for patients who had little money.

“I would really like to practice in a world where I can just take care of my patients and that’s the end of it,” she said, “where the big elephant in the room is not whether or not my recommendations mean anything because of cost.”

Mr. Olsgaard, 28, also found that money drove medical decisions at the community health center where he worked. “You know the patient, you know the patient’s financial information, and then you make clinical decisions based on that,” he said.

Ben J. Ruffatto, 26, said that after working with a family practitioner in Dillon, Mont., he had become convinced that rationing health care was “a socioeconomic national cultural inevitability.”

“It is right now,” Mr. Ruffatto said. “There simply isn’t enough money in the system for everyone to get absolutely everything that they want.”

There were differing opinions among the students about critical components of the plans being discussed by President Obama and Congress, like whether health coverage should be mandated and whether the government should create a public insurance option. But even those favoring the Democratic approach said they felt momentum had stalled.

“I really like Obama, but I’m a little bummed,” Ms. Boggess said. “He has yet to really strongly make the moral argument for providing health care to our citizens.”

Some, like Elizabeth M. Stuhlmiller, 25, who worked in a clinic in Tonasket, Wash., said they had not paid much attention to the debate, but had learned this summer to take satisfaction in improving the country’s health one patient at a time.

“I think I can fill a hole; I think that there’s a big need,” said Ms. Stuhlmiller, who plans to pursue primary care. “I don’t necessarily have the goals of changing a system. To feel at the end of the day that I’ve treated a patient and helped them, that would be enough for me.”"
76,759,2009-09-10T00:00:00Z,article,Tech Companies Push to Digitize Patients' Records,5455fa7f38f0d84a08fb2d8e,"subject:Electronic Health Records, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Reform and Reorganization, organizations:Dell Inc, organizations:General Electric Co, subject:Computers and the Internet",Business,0.0,None,Both large and small technology firms are devising ways to update health care records. About $19 billion in government financing will help.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/technology/10records.html,1401,Both large and small technology firms are devising ways to update health care records. About $19 billion in government financing will help.,"But doctors in small offices have not moved to digital records, mainly because today’s technology is costly and complex.

What is needed, experts agree, are new models of delivery and easier-to-use technology to reduce the expense and technical headaches. The proposed offerings are typically bets on the new Internet-based service model, known as cloud computing, in which much of the computing firepower and data reside in remote data centers, which doctors, nurses and staff would use via the Web browsers on their personal computers.

Faster networks, improved wireless connections and more affordable tablet PCs or small desktops promise to make the shift to digital patient records less cumbersome these days. But technical assistance and user guidance are also needed. And several companies plan to offer bridge financing to doctors to ease the burden of initial investment costs until the government begins making payments, which can be up to $44,000 for each doctor, from 2011 to 2015.

Dell plans to act as the hardware supplier and general contractor, working with partners like eClinicalWorks, a maker of electronic health record software, and Perot Systems for data-center hosting, if the medical groups outsource that task.

Dell already has pilot projects under way with a few hospital groups, including Memorial Hermann Healthcare System in Houston and Tufts Medical Center in Boston. This year, Dell announced it was teaming up with Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart, to offer the hardware, software and services for electronic health records to doctors in small practices.

“The technology has to be a simplified, affordable package for physicians,” said Jamie Coffin, general manager of Dell’s health care business. “We’re really going after this market in a concerted way.”

The government’s effort to try to encourage a market in digital health records, experts say, faces formidable hurdles. The risk is that physicians buy lots of computer hardware and software, but see no improvements, leaving a legacy of wasted money, angry doctors and disrupted care for patients.

“It’s certainly a gamble,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, former national health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration. “But I do think the net effect is going to be a lot of new efforts at innovation.”

In many large medical groups, like Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic, all the doctors use electronic health records. Yet over all, only about 17 percent of America’s physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Encouraged by the stimulus financing, many companies besides Dell are hurrying to help lift that percentage considerably.

G.E. is an established supplier of electronic health records that work as traditional personal computer software. The company, said Vishal Wanchoo, chief executive of G.E.’s health information technology business, has recently done a lot of prototype work on how to make the shift to digital records easier and less costly for small practices. Early next year, G.E. will offer a data-center hosted version of its electronic health records, delivered over the Internet. “It will help us reach more physicians,” he said.

EClinicalWorks has added four data centers in the last year, bringing the total to 10, for hosting electronic health records as a service over the Internet. The company offers its records both as conventional PC software and as a Web service. “The software as a service is where the biggest growth is,” said Girish Kumar Navani, president of eClinicalWorks.

At Athenahealth, a supplier of online billing services and health records, Jonathan Bush, the chief executive, says his company plans to announce a marketing drive and technical assistance program later this month to accelerate the adoption of its digital records. And at Practice Fusion, a start-up offering Web-based patient records free to physicians, supported by online advertising, the government program has prompted a surge of interest, said Ryan Howard, the chief executive.

Even I.B.M., whose health business is geared to big medical groups, is planning a move. The company does not make electronic health record software, and so would work with partners. I.B.M. will not say precisely what it plans. “Adoption is so low in small practices because the economics doesn’t work for them, but the cloud computing model can help change that,” said Sean Hogan, vice president of I.B.M’s health care delivery unit. “And yes, we’re going to be delivering a cloud-based service into this space.”

Verizon started a health care unit this summer, which now has a staff of 500. The company plans to work with many health technology partners to offer electronic health records over the Internet in several months, a spokesman said.

Verizon is focused mainly on data-center hosting and data-sharing technology, as the hub of local and regional health information networks. The office of Dr. Allen Gee offers a glimpse of the pitfalls and promise of electronic health records. A sole practitioner in Cody, Wyo., Dr. Gee, 43, was enthusiastic about the potential of modern computer technology to improve care. So for three years, ending in 2005, he invested in computers, software and consulting services. In all, he estimates he spent $100,000, and got little in return.

“It was hot-rod technology that cost me a lot and didn’t improve my practice,” Dr. Gee recalled.

Later, Dr. Gee tried again. This time, he went with an online service for billing and electronic health records. His supplier, Athenahealth, offers not only Internet technology, but also a distinctive business model, which some analysts say could prove a winner in encouraging small practices to adopt digital records. The company handles most of the back-office functions of billing and medical records, and collects a fraction of the physician’s revenue — 5 to 8 percent, in Dr. Gee’s case.

Financially, Dr. Gee says, he has come out ahead, since he no longer pays an outside billing company. And he is a convert to digital health records.

Like all physicians who are enthusiasts, Dr. Gee speaks of the value of alerts and reminders of patient care, automated tracking of lab tests and e-prescribing. It saves time, paperwork and helps make him a better doctor, he said. Dr. Gee roams the office with his tablet PC and a Bluetooth ear piece, dictating his notes using voice-to-text software.

Whether a company, hospital or community health technology assistance centers, which the government program finances, small practices need hand-holding and technical help, Dr. Gee said.

The federal assistance, he said, has “a lot of potential to do good things for the country, but it could also end up as a huge headache for small practices. We’re doctors, not technologists. You need help to manage the process.”"
77,751,2009-09-21T17:57:17Z,blogpost,Is U.S. Health Care System Not the Culprit?,4fd396ff8eb7c8105d8cefa9,type_of_material:News,None,0.0,None,Could the American health-care system not be guilty of decreasing Americans' life expectancy?,The New York Times,https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/is-us-health-care-system-not-the-culprit/,560,Could the American health-care system not be guilty of decreasing Americans’ life expectancy?,"In my Findings column, I discuss reasons for the longevity gap between the United States and most other developed countries. Our shorter life expectancy has often been blamed on the health-care system’s failings. But after looking at mortality trends and treatment patterns, Samuel H. Preston and Jessica Y. Ho of the University of Pennsylvania reach another verdict: “We conclude that the low longevity ranking of the United States is not likely to be a result of a poorly functioning health-care system.”

This is a noteworthy conclusion coming from the eminent demographer for whom the Preston Curve is named. Dr. Preston, who is an expert on trends in mortality and disease, and Ms. Yo dispute the much-quoted scorecard from the Commonwealth Fund issued last year. The Commonwealth report ranked America last among industrialized nations in “mortality amenable to health care,” and estimated that 101,000 lives would be saved annually if the U.S. health-care system performed as well the systems in France, Japan or Australia. The estimates were based on a study, supported by the Commonwealth Fund, that was published in the journal Health Affairs last year by Ellen Nolte and C. Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The Penn researchers raise several criticisms of those estimates of preventable deaths, and I’ll discuss some of the specifics in a subsequent post, along with a response from Dr. Nolte and Dr. McKee.

For now, let’s concentrate on the basic argument of Dr. Preston: that the longevity gap is due not to the American health-care system but to other factors, like rates of obesity and the exceptionally heavy smoking that prevailed among Americans for until the 1980s. (Per-capita consumption was higher than in any other developed country, particularly among women.) Dr. Preston and Ms. Ho write: “The health care system could be performing exceptionally well in identifying and administering treatment for various diseases, but a country could still have poor measured health if personal health-care practices were unusually deleterious.”

The Penn researchers cite a variety of evidence that Americans (including the uninsured) receive more thorough treatment in many ways than people in other countries. At the same time, they acknowledge the system is much costlier than other countries’ and can be criticized on many grounds. They write:

Evidence that the major diseases are effectively diagnosed and treated in the US does not mean that there may not be great inefficiencies in the US health care system. A list of prominent charges include fragmentation, duplication, inaccessibility of records, the practice of defensive medicine, misalignment of physician and patient incentives, limitations of access for a large fraction of the population, and excessively fast adoption of unproven technologies . . . Just as we are not addressing issues of efficiency on the production side, we are not treating patient welfare as the main outcome. Practices that produce greater longevity do not necessarily enhance well-being. This potential disparity is central to the controversy involving PSA testing, which uncovers many cancers that would never kill patients but whose treatment often produces adverse side effects. The question that we have posed is much simpler: does a poor performance by the U.S. health care system account for the low international ranking of longevity in the U.S.? Our answer is, “no”.

Now for your answer (or, if you, prefer, more questions about the paper by Dr. Preston and Ms. Ho)."

But hospitals are seeking a competitive edge, too. Digital links, analysts say, can also tighten the bonds between doctors and the hospital groups that subsidize the computerized records. In most local markets, independent physicians typically have admitting privileges at more than one nearby hospital, and so hospitals compete for doctors as well as patients.

“The North Shore-L.I.J. program is larger than other programs,” said Wes Rishel, a health technology expert at Gartner. “And it punctuates a trend of hospital groups trying to solidify and tighten relationships with physicians in their communities.”

In other words, the government-backed campaign to hasten the adoption of electronic health records has the potential not only to change how health care is delivered. It could also influence which institutions emerge as leaders in delivering care, as some local markets consolidate further.

The North Shore program is to carry strong incentives to use the electronic-record technology to try improving the health outcomes for patients — like managing diabetes, heart disease and other chronic conditions — to reduce costly hospital admissions.

The subsidy will be 50 percent of the total cost for physicians who simply install electronic health records that can communicate between the doctor’s office, labs and hospitals.

But the subsidy will rise to 85 percent of the total costs of digital records for physicians who agree to share data — stripped of personal identifiers — on patient measures that include glucose levels for people with diabetes and post-operative procedures and prescriptions for heart patients. That could help North Shore amass an ever-growing database of evidence indicating which treatments and procedures yield the best medical results.

When there are evidence-based standards for the best care for patients with particular conditions, doctors should then adopt them, said Michael Dowling, chief executive of North Shore, which operates 13 hospitals, 18 long-term care facilities, and dozens of outpatient centers and hospices on Long Island, Queens and Staten Island.

“We are going to change how we deliver care, and we should be held accountable for outcomes — not just measured on the number of procedures performed,” Mr. Dowling said.

Indeed, the rationale for investing in digital records is that the technology can be used to help monitor and measure the results of care, providing the evidence needed to shift remuneration away from the current fee-for-service system, which encourages more tests, more procedures and more pills prescribed.

The North Shore initiative will begin with about 100 physicians, and then roll out more broadly. Dr. Randolph DiLorenzo, a family doctor in a three-physician practice in Syosset, N.Y., has signed up to join the first wave. Like many doctors in small offices, he resisted embracing electronic health records until now, citing the cost and complexity.

But Dr. DiLorenzo, pointing to the North Shore and government incentives, as well as a long-term shift to evidence-based medicine and payment, said, “This is inevitable, and now is the time.”

Dr. DiLorenzo was also impressed by the technology, when representatives from North Shore and vendors working on the project gave him a demonstration in his office. The program will deploy tablet personal computers by Dell, and software by Allscripts, which can be retrieved by a doctor from devices including PCs, BlackBerrys and iPhones.

The North Shore move will be closely watched. “This is big enough and bold enough that hospital groups across the country will take notice and rethink their own plans,” said Glen E. Tullman, chief executive of Allscripts.

Still, to move so forcefully, analysts note, also carries risk for North Shore, if the expected payoff for physicians and the hospital group proves elusive. Mr. Dowling acknowledged that risk, but he added: “This was not done on a pure dollars-and-cents, return-on-investment perspective. But better health care and better quality should be a good investment.”"
79,746,2009-10-06T00:00:00Z,article,Adding Health Advice to Online Medical Records,5456f25e38f0d86ef22a0f81,"subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Electronic Health Records, organizations:Google Inc, organizations:Microsoft Corp",Business,0.0,None,A Web start-up led by a former Google executive plans to generate personalized health plans.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/technology/06bosworth.html,1319,A Web start-up led by a former Google executive plans to generate personalized health plans.,"Using the Keas system, for example, a person with Type 2 diabetes might receive reminders, advice on diet and exercise, questions and prompts presented on the Web site or delivered by e-mail or text messages — all personalized for the person’s age, gender, weight and other health conditions.

Although success is far from certain, Keas has some big partners, including Google Health and Microsoft HealthVault.

Health technology experts say Keas is at the forefront of the effort to combine advanced Web and database technologies so it can personalize health education. The promise, they say, is a big step forward for online health tools, and could help accelerate their adoption — much as the spreadsheet program helped kick-start the personal computer industry back in the early 1980s.

“This is the next generation of applications for online health care,” said Dr. David C. Kibbe, a health technology expert and senior adviser to the American Academy of Family Physicians, who is also a member of the Keas advisory board.

The Obama administration has drafted its guidelines for producing electronic health records — patient records held by doctors and hospitals — with applications like Keas in mind. To qualify for government subsidies, the electronic records must be able to generate patient education materials that help guide care, and eventually share information with personally controlled health records of the sort offered by Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault.

“The goal is not just health care information, but knowledge about what that means and what action to take,” said Dr. John D. Halamka, chief information officer at the Harvard Medical School, and a member of a federal advisory group on electronic health records. “And that is what Keas, and others in different ways, are really starting to think through.”

Other initial partners of Keas are impressed with its technology. Healthwise, a nonprofit supplier of online health information, has created 15 care plans for Keas so far, including ones on high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, weight management and stress management.

Healthwise provides health content to major managed care companies, insurers and Web portals, including Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, WebMD, Revolution Health, Yahoo, MSN and AOL.

But Keas, said Jim Giuffre, president of Healthwise, has a feature that is distinct from other health services online. “They have developed the technology to make decisions from personalized data,” Mr. Giuffre said. “We think it’s going to help consumers make better health care choices.”

Dr. Alan R. Greene, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, has two children’s care plans on Keas, for ear infections and asthma, and is working on others. Dr. Greene has done projects with WebMD and Yahoo in the past. “But this little start-up has an extremely powerful tool, both personalized and interactive,” he said.

For medical experts, Keas is currently helping them with technical assistance. But the company intends to keep simplifying the tools so that individual physicians or health experts can build their own care plans.

The technical game plan at Keas bears the imprint of Mr. Bosworth’s career. As a senior engineer at Microsoft in the 1990s, he led the design team that created Access, a personal computer database program, introduced in 1992, which enabled nonprogrammers to build databases. Later, Mr. Bosworth focused on Internet software, working on Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser and then XML, an open technology for tagging text documents on the Web and data sharing between programs.

Database expertise, easy-to-use tools for nonexperts and automated data sharing among Web documents are all essential ingredients in the personalized care plans.

At Google, which he joined in 2004, Mr. Bosworth worked on Gmail, Blogger, online spreadsheets and other products. But the company’s leaders knew he was interested in using Internet technology to improve health care. Having studied history at Harvard, Mr. Bosworth is a voracious and eclectic reader and a globe-trotting traveler. (The name “kea” refers to a species of alpine parrot, which he spotted on the South Island of New Zealand).

“I spent 25 years of my life building Lego blocks for computing,” said Mr. Bosworth, 54, adding that the time had come to pursue wider horizons.

His years at Google, Mr. Bosworth said, were good ones, and the work the health team was doing with personal health records was important. Moving people’s data online, where individuals can control it, he said, would be vital to using Internet technology to improve health care — and only big companies like Google and Microsoft can do that.

“But I decided my focus should be on the other side of the equation — what to do with the data,” he said.

So Mr. Bosworth left Google, founded Keas and started hiring people in March 2008. The company has 24 employees, and last December it received venture capital backing from Atlas Ventures and Ignition Partners.

The Keas site requires a user to sign in and fill out a questionnaire. Personal health records from Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault can be automatically fed into the Keas care plans.

Another early partner is Quest Diagnostics, the nation’s largest clinical laboratory company, and, with permission, an individual’s lab data can influence the Keas plans. Users can put in as much or as little personal information as they want. Because Keas works with care providers, like doctors, it is required by law to adhere to all federal rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, for encrypting and handling information to safeguard the privacy of personal information, Mr. Bosworth said.

The care plans present personalized status reports, as individualized dashboards, showing a person to be in the red, yellow or green bands. Green is good, and care plans make recommendations on how to get there.

Initially, the care plans will be free, but eventually Keas will include subscriptions for plans, probably at a few dollars a month. Keas will take a slice, and pass the rest on to the plan creator — the model used by the Apple’s iPhone applications store.

“We’re still learning, so we’re in no rush to charge,” Mr. Bosworth said. “But the idea is that people will get paid for doing things that are really engaging and useful.”

In the long term, Mr. Bosworth hopes Keas will evolve into a marketplace, where health experts are the sellers, and consumers who want the best personalized advice are the buyers. “I think that’s a pretty big idea,” he said. “If it works, it helps drive consumerism into health care.”"

You can watch it online.

Working for this show is always a treat; very few network news shows dedicate 8 or 9 minutes to dive into a single story.

Even so, I get to interview fascinating people, but have time to use only a fraction of what they say. So I like to use this space to offer more complete excerpts from those chats. Today, an interview with Dr. David Blumenthal, the President’s medical-records czar.

DAVID POGUE: Before you took this job, you did a study of hospitals and doctors going digital, right?

DAVID BLUMENTHAL: Yes. We found that about 17 percent of physicians in 2008 had adopted an electronic health record, and about ten percent of hospitals.

DP: And the rest are doing what?

DB: The rest is paper. It’s basically the same system that physicians have used since Hippocrates, which is writing on some piece of paper.

DP: What’s the downside of paper?

DB: It doesn’t capitalize on the tremendous power of computers, which have transformed the use of information in every other part of our lives, business and travel and leisure.

Computers can help doctors be better doctors. They can help hospitals be better hospitals. They can help patients take control of their illnesses, not only by making the information available in a reliable way, but by adding tips and reminders and personalized messages about what to do to improve your health, or what tests to order if you’re a physician, and what drugs to use or to avoid.

I was a primary-care physician for over 30 years. I can vividly recall a time when I was getting ready to discharge a patient from the hospital on a particular medication, and I ordered the medication. We had a system that checked the orders against allergies and contraindications, and the computer told me that the patient was allergic to the medication that I was about to use.

I was extremely grateful for that, because I had missed it. It’s very easy for physicians to overlook the thousands of details they have to keep track of. And a computer can make that physician a little more aware of all the patients’ needs and information.

DP: Where do we stand relative to other countries?

DB: Most other countries have much more use of electronic health records than we do. For example, the Danes have virtually 100 percent of physicians using electronic health records. In Britain, virtually 100 percent of primary care physicians use them. In Australia, Sweden, Norway, virtually 100 percent. In many, many other Western countries, the electronic record is virtually ubiquitous.

Now, I think that if we are successful with the ambitions that we have for this record, we will leapfrog many of our colleagues abroad. But for the moment, I would have to say that we are well behind our Western colleagues.

DP: How is all of this supposed to bring down medical costs?

DB: Well, let me give you another personal story. I was ordering a CAT scan for a patient. And my computer system was designed so that it would look at what else had been ordered on this patient. And it informed me that a very similar test had been ordered on this patient within the last three months, and that I should check that out. And, sure enough, it had the information I needed. So I avoided giving the patient a dose of radiation that he didn’t need. I avoided the expense of that test. And I got the information sooner.

DP: Shouldn’t that information have been in the paper chart?

DB: It wouldn’t have been in the paper chart in a way that would have reminded me to look for it.

DP: I see. But not all doctors are thrilled by all of this. They’re saying, first of all, we’re the ones who’ve gotta pay for it.

DB: Yeah, well, I think that’s a fair point. But we have new legislation that was part of the Recovery Act, which President Obama signed in February of 2009, that makes available $45 billion through Medicare and Medicaid to help doctors pay to acquire and use electronic health records. So I don’t think that the complaint about not having help to acquire these records is a fair complaint anymore.

The second point I would make is that though it’s hard to adopt these records, almost no physicians who have acquired them have ever wanted to give them up.

DP: So part of it might be just fear of the unknown, fear of change?

DB: Well, fear of change is a natural human response. I think it’s also the fact that it’s not easy to get these set up. There is a cost, and we can’t deny that. The question is how to help physicians and hospitals get past that cost. Once they get past it, I think once they get over the hill, the valley on the other side is lovely. But they’ve gotta get over the hill.

DP: A couple of doctors were pointing out that the government money comes as a reimbursement. They have to buy the systems, install them, and then show the government, “Look, we have it working.” But they’re saying, “I’m a small practice. I’m a rural guy. Where am I supposed to get the money to invest up front?”

DB: Well, some vendors of these systems will loan the money to doctors in advance. General Electric, for example, made that offer.

Secondly, physicians, frankly, make a lot of investments in their practice as small business people, on the prospect that they will get payment for those investments down the line. Physicians buy examining tables, they buy X-ray equipment, they buy treadmill tests, they buy colonoscopic equipment—and then they wait to get paid. So I think it’s a fair analogy to what we’re asking the physicians right now.

DP: How does this reimbursement happen? Is it a penalty through Medicare and Medicaid to doctors who don’t get with the program? Or a benefit if they do?

DB: It’s some of both. From 2011 to 2015, there is a bonus. The Congress has put $45 billion on the table to ease physicians and hospitals into this new world of computerized medicine.

After 2015, if you have not adopted, and you see Medicare or Medicaid patients, you may experience a penalty.

2015 is six years off. Six years is plenty of time for physicians to get themselves organized to put a record in place and avoid those penalties.

DP: And how much does it cost? For, say, one doctor?

DB: On average, the cost is between $40,000 and $50,000, of which about a third is the software and the hardware, about a third is the cost of getting it set up in the office, and about a third is maintaining it. Much of the expense is related to the cost of implementing and the cost of maintaining it over time.

DP: What about the interoperability problem? Every software company selling these systems puts the data in a different format.

DB: We’re doing a lot in this office to try to minimize that problem. We’re gonna be helping states to create interoperability capability, capabilities to link records, to link institutions.

And we’re developing standards at the national level to make it possible for records to talk to each other. And then we’re also gonna be certifying records, to give physicians and hospitals some guidance about the capabilities of those records, so that they’ll know in advance whether or not the records are gonna be able to talk to each other.

These [standards discussions] are open processes. This will all be a very open and transparent process.

DP: I’m sure you hear this at the cocktail parties all the time: “What about my privacy?”

DB: Privacy and security are foundational to a modern health information system. You cannot get the computer into this business without assuring people that their information, their personal information, will be safe.

So we are looking at the best possible technical solutions, technical protections, to privacy and security. We want to make sure that we have looked at every opportunity for encryption, every security device that the best minds can think of, to make information safer. We’ve got it in other parts of the industry, but we don’t have it for healthcare. So I think that’s a very important agenda item for us.

DP: And what exactly is the privacy fear? People are afraid of hackers? Or people finding out that they have bad breath, or—?

DB: There are two kinds of anxieties. One is that their data may be used for purposes that they haven’t authorized it. So if they haven’t authorized their personal data to be used for research, they don’t want it for that purpose. And the way the law gets around that problem is by saying that information should be de-identified; that is, it should be abstracted from the record in a way that can never be traced back to that individual.

And then that information can be used for research on drug safety, or research on the value of particular treatments, or anything els that may be useful to human health.

There’s another kind of fear, and that is the fear of the breach or break-in, or hacking. And there have been some examples of that.

That’s where better encryption and better barriers to hacking are critical. And, you know, we have a new cybersecurity initiative that President Obama has put in process. It’s well known that the security of information is a national need for defense purposes. It’s also, I think, a very important need for this domestic policy purpose. So we want to work with that security initiative to know that we’ve taken advantage of everything that the federal government and the computer industry knows about how to keep records secure.

DP: And the President wants to have all of this in place in five years?

DB: The President has stated a goal that every American will have the benefit of an electronic record by 2014. That’s a very ambitious goal. We are working hard to attain it, and we hope we will attain it.

DP: It’s a lot of pieces, right? The software part, the money part, the security part, the standards…and all these critics with their objections. Do you ever just get tired of having to explain yourself?

DB: Well, it’s a big challenge, it’s an exciting challenge, and a historic challenge. There’s nothing that’s worth doing that’s easy to do in life, and this is one of those.

But I really think that history is on the side of this activity. To be a 21st-century physician, to be a 21st-century hospital, we can’t record data the same way the Greeks did in 500 B.C. We’ve gotta move to use the computer to support our work. And that’s what we’re trying to do.

There’ll be bumps on the road. We’re not gonna be perfect. We’ll make mistakes. But I think the wind is at our back in terms of the historical trends. And we’ll get there, sooner or later."

The cost and complexity of making the transition are daunting, though the government’s $19 billion in incentives for doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records should help.

But the hoped-for benefits of digital health records — better care and curbed spending — will not really materialize unless information flows seamlessly and securely among labs, clinics, hospitals, doctors’ offices and patients. General Electric‘s big health care division is introducing on Thursday a new unit, eHealth, to pursue the business opportunity presented by this challenge.

The main target for G.E.’s new business unit is in providing the technology and expertise to build regional and statewide Health Information Exchanges, as these planned data-sharing hubs are now being called. An initial $564 million grant from federal government to the states will provide seed money to get things started.

Over the last two decades, there have been efforts to set up such health information-sharing networks. They were first called Community Health Information Networks and later Regional Health Information Organizations. Mostly, they failed.

Hospitals and physician groups had no incentive to make the investment to share patient information, since they were not paid for doing so.

But to qualify for incentive payments from the government, doctors and hospitals need to adopt electronic health records that share information across networks. “Now there is a business case for the exchange of health information,” said Vishal Wanchoo, president of G.E.’s health care information technology business. “You have no choice and you will be paid to do it.”

G.E. said it was investing $90 million to get the new eHealth unit going. Its offerings include software for securely storing and sharing patient information, a Web portal that can pull patient information from various sources and present it to doctor, and a Web-based personal health record, called LifeSensor. It was built by a G.E. partner, InterComponentWare.

So is G.E. going head-to-head in the emerging field of personal health records — controlled by individuals, not a doctor, hospital or insurer — with the likes of Google and Microsoft?

Not really, Mr. Wanchoo said. EHealth will be an international business, and health ministries in places like Saudi Arabia and Singapore want to build digital health networks and also want personal health records to be part of those networks. Google and Microsoft, Mr. Wanchoo said, are not yet offering personal health records in many nations.

“We’ve got a good product, but it’s not a primary focus for us in this country,” he said. “Our focus is on building out health information exchanges, and we view the personal health record as mainly a patient management application.”

G.E. points to the Keystone Health Information Exchange that spans 31 counties in central and northeastern Pennsylvania as a success story in progress. G.E. built a health document vault that holds some patient information from many hospitals in the region.

The lesson from the Pennsylvania experience, it seems, is to proceed in measured steps. Lab test results can now automatically be transferred to electronic health records, notes Jim Younkin, technology program director Geisinger Health System, a large medical group.

Future features, Mr. Younkin said, will include computerized notifications to primary physicians when one of their patients has been admitted or released from a hospital, and aggregated tracking of a person’s lab and radiology tests. The payoff, he said, should be better follow-up care for patients from better-informed doctors and nurses, and fewer duplicate tests.

“This is going to be a steadily evolving thing,” Mr. Younkin said. “We should be busy for many years to come.”"

On Tuesday, the chip maker unveiled the Intel Reader, a handheld device for people who struggle to read standard texts because of conditions like dyslexia and blindness. The Intel Reader can scan books and other printed material, turn the text into a digital form and read it aloud. Intel looks to sell the device through resellers like HumanWare and Howard Technology Solutions that cater to the assistive technology and medical technology markets.

In the mainstream computer market, Intel will sometimes make prototypes that show off the power of its chips. The company, however, has resisted bringing such products to market and always steps aside to let its PC-making customers go directly after end users. But, in the health care market, Intel has opted to sell its own gear.

The device costs about $1,500, which may sound pricey for a fixed-function type of computing device. But, as I pointed out in an article in September, many of the text-to-speech products covered by Medicare and health insurance companies start at $5,000 and run up to $10,000. The high cost of such products, along with their limited functions, has resulted in people with a variety of conditions adding cheap text-to-speech software to iPhones and netbooks to create their own assistive devices.

“The direct sales of products is part of our strategy in the health area,” said Ben Foss, the director of access technology in Intel’s Digital Health Group. “These markets are large and going after them is important. We are trying to get economies of scale.”

For Mr. Foss, the Intel Reader arrives with a personal twist. Mr. Foss has dyslexia and went through special education classes in elementary school. In college, Mr. Foss would fax his assignments home so his mother could read them out loud to him on the phone.

“My speech technology was my mom,” he said.

The Intel Reader has a five-megapixel camera that lets people point the device at reading material and capture the text. Software helps align pages correctly and fix things like shadows or curved pages. In addition, Intel is selling a complementary scanning station product that can digitize text and transfer the information over to the Intel Reader.

At its core, the Intel Reader runs on Intel’s own modified version of Linux called Moblin, although general-purpose computing functions have been limited. For example, the computer lacks wireless support. “We didn’t put it in because we didn’t want students surfing the Internet,” Mr. Foss said.

As things stand today, health insurers decline to cover general-purpose computing systems. Instead, they will cover the $5,000 to $10,000 products that can only perform text-to-speech functions. In some cases, people use their health insurance money to buy such text-to-speech devices and then pay about $50 later to “activate” the products and turn them into full-fledged computers.

“The product definitions the government and insurers use are a bit peculiar,” Mr. Foss said.

Interestingly, Mr. Foss said that Great Britain has a more flexible program in place that gives students a 5000-pound grant to buy whatever assistive technology they need before heading to university.

Intel looks to make a variety of devices for the health care market as it tries to find more uses for its chips. The company has been going after products that make it easier for doctors and nurses to pull up digital records along with talking up home health products that can perform certain tests and link patients remotely with their doctors."

“Optimistic” may be about the last word you’d choose to describe the health care industry. Or maybe “innovative.” But the work now being undertaken by Kaiser Permanente, the nation’s largest not-for-profit health plan, would make you gravitate toward those descriptors. Kaiser’s collaborative, institution-wide effort known as KP Innovation could revolutionize health care for the whole industry.

Kaiser Permanente

Over the past few years, I’ve noticed that there was something very different about the way Kaiser communicated its brand. Their “Thrive” campaign, created by Campbell-Ewald, posits Kaiser less as a medical/institutional service than a lifestyle. Both in print and on TV, the ads are visually compelling (clever puns, blueberries elevated to high art) and emotionally engaging (online medical records not only streamline procedures, they save trees and the planet), with voiceovers by the appealing Allison Janney, formerly of “The West Wing.” The intended message is not how well Kaiser will care for you when you’re sick, but rather how Kaiser helps deliver wellness and can enhance the quality of your life.

It would be easy to dismiss “Thrive” as a great piece of ad work, one likely masking larger institutional deficiencies. But the thing is, Kaiser has invested an incredible amount of its resources to align itself with the brand message conveyed by “Thrive.” Their efforts to improve the patient experience touch all facets, from designing greener, healthier buildings to increasing the amount of time nurses spend at bedside. And they are helping resuscitate an industry that’s never been more in need of fresh air.



I’ve written here about how even the most seemingly innocuous details of the health care environment — a dead potted plant in a doctor’s reception room, an ill-fitting hospital gown, a blaring television — can contribute to an unpleasant, at times even devastating experience. Recognizing that reality, Kaiser’s National Facilities Services (N.F.S.) group has, since 2007, been working on the Total Health Environment, a program that is applying design thinking to every aspect of Kaiser’s operations, from medical records to medication administration, color palettes to carpet.

Even the most seemingly innocuous details — a dead potted plant in a reception room, an ill-fitting hospital gown, a blaring television — can contribute to an unpleasant experience.

“Total health” becomes a principle on which to build new facilities and remodel existing ones. Though certainly not the first health care provider to improve its facilities and service (an exemplar is the Mayo Clinic), Kaiser Permanente may be the first to reach so many people. KP has nearly 9 million members spread from Washington, D.C., to Hawaii, a team of 14,000 physicians and a workforce of 167,000.

Early on, N.F.S. team members began touring several of Kaiser’s facilities, taking note of all aspects that were distinctly “not thriving.” They visited both competing institutions and analogous places (like cafés, hotels and retail establishments). They interviewed all relevant stakeholders, from orderlies to patients’ family members, about their experiences, and anyone who has ever visited doctors’ offices and hospitals would nod in agreement with many of the Kaiser team’s findings.

Some of what the team learned (quotes in parentheses are from interviews): People can’t find entrances, or parking, or where they need to go (“There are so many signs! All the buildings look alike!”). Grand lobbies instill anxiety rather than awe. Waiting rooms are dreadful, time-wasting, uncomfortable (“Why are these magazines so old?”; “I hope I don’t catch anything”). Cafeterias = inedible food + unpleasant environment (“Is this café clean?”). Examination and hospital rooms are impersonal, isolating and not family-friendly (“I hope nobody walks in without knocking”; “I am so bored”; “Can my daughter sit with me?”). People need more information, more connection, more control.

The collaborative team designated 22 key experiences that together add up to what they call a “Total Health Journey.” These touch on each moment of the patient’s experience, from the approach to the facility to the route down the corridor to any stop made along the way, whether at check-in, in an exam room, or at the cafeteria, pharmacy or bathroom. The design solutions that emerged include things as seemingly obvious as clearly marked signage; stairwells that might actually encourage people to take the stairs (and remove the fear that anyone who does so might end up locked in between floors); the creation of outdoor spaces that provide escape and respite, not to mention natural light; transforming typically unwelcoming cafeterias to more people-friendly cafés; and an exam room that emphasizes comfort, privacy and personal control.

Key Experience #13, for example, addressed the waiting room, which traditionally features linear seating arrangements. Kaiser eschews the typical “bus station seating” for comfortable chairs, with brighter color palettes, and the more flexible seating allows for situation- or needs-based configurations.

Key Experience #19 focuses on the patient room. A multi-disciplinary, multi-regional panel of experts (nurses, infection-control specialists, Kaiser members, brand consultants and others) developed a template flexible enough to work for a variety of patient populations across all Kaiser facilities. They addressed problems including harsh lighting, lack of storage, a surplus of “hard” spaces (with few softer ones) and the intimidating amount of equipment and technology a patient was confronted with from the entryway and from the bed.

Kaiser Permanente

The redesigned room was divided into five distinct zones:

Kaiser Permanente

Innovations include more effective and attractive receptacles for waste management and soiled linen, increased storage space, better equipment organization and more readable patient care information in the nurse zone; and greater privacy and more comfortable furniture in the family zone.

Something as simple as redesigning the headwall into a more efficient, modular headboard saved a whopping $2,369 per room — and is far more comfortable to boot. Language was rethought as well: this new room is a “guest room,” not a “patient room,” part of a larger move toward thinking about health and wellness rather than sickness.

Integral to the Total Health endeavor has been its embrace of sustainable materials, systems and technology, from denim insulation for walls to the introduction of farmers markets at 30 facilities in six states. (Other hospitals are embracing similar food and farm innovations. San Francisco’s newly rebuilt Laguna Honda Hospital will feature a therapeutic farm and garden for patients.) The move toward sustainability can be credited in large part to committed KP leadership. But of course much of the cost-saving is possible because of Kaiser’s size, which gives them incredible buying power.

In 2000, for example, they launched a national campaign to remove polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from products and building materials, including carpets. At the time, PVC was ubiquitous in health care settings, even though the material is a major source of dioxin, a known human carcinogen. Working with the carpet manufacturer Collins and Aikman (now known as Tandus), KP helped create a new type of carpet backing that is PVC-free (it’s made from recycled safety glass from car windshields), while also meeting performance requirements for health care settings. Four years later, the new carpet was on the market. Since 2004, approximately 10 million square feet of this carpet has been installed in Kaiser Permanente facilities — and it is also available to the health care industry at large.

Though hospitals will end up looking better, these efforts aren’t about decorating, they’re about outcomes. Numerous studies point to the benefits of the design strategies and environmental interventions KP has proposed and implemented. Factors like the quality and intensity of light, access to natural light, the noise level in a room, the privacy afforded by single-patient rooms — all of these affect patient health, satisfaction, soundness of sleep and speed of healing. Views of nature have been shown to decrease depression, pain, stress and even length of hospital stays. Floor plans that are designed to help health care workers do their work more effectively (as well as increase privacy and comfort of patients) can reduce falls, improve patient communication and lessen stress for all.

I can’t help thinking of the enormous opportunity for other large corporations and institutions to take a cue from Kaiser’s efforts. There is no reason why schools and banks, as well as major homebuilders and office, hospitality and retail developers can’t make similar demands of their vendors and contractors. Wal-Mart, for example, has mandated the goals of using only renewable energy, producing zero waste and selling only sustainable products (now, if they’d only provide Kaiser-like health care for all employees). Why aren’t builders demanding that makers of vinyl siding develop a more sustainable alternative? Or require that buildings generate some percentage of their own electricity from alternative energy? Why not save money, heal the planet and improve quality of life for workers, residents, students and customers?

Kaiser has made a commitment to share their research, from process to product, for free. As Denton says, “We are intent on sharing everything that we do. We’re doing it for the benefit of everyone in health care. We are trying to make human-centered design and designing for emotions as meaningful for the patient as possible and as doable for health care organizations as possible.”

That others might take notice — finally — might help steer us all toward thriving rather than just surviving."

If this happens, you have to integrate the experience, but for a while you lose your bearings. It is discombobulating. When this is followed by litigation, the effect can be paralyzing. And the lawsuit felt like an assault. Being sued, even with assurances that “it’s nothing personal” and that my insurance would most likely cover any settlement, was in fact deeply personal. The experience was devastating.

Still, I coped well enough. I was able to see patients and almost lose myself in their stories. One day I went in to see a delightful 95-year-old woman for a blood pressure check. In the middle of the visit, she gave me a piercing look. “You’ve got something on your mind,” she told me. “You take care of yourself.”

A few months later, my lawyer, Amy, arrived, a brisk, no-nonsense woman hauling a suitcase full of records. We spent an exhausting and inconclusive morning reviewing the case and the questions it raised. I couldn’t tell if she thought I might win or lose the suit. This was the first of many such marathons.

I had been cautioned not to discuss the details of the case with anyone except my defense team. At one point, I told Amy that I had decided to keep a journal of the experience. Apparently, this was a bad idea. A journal could be subpoenaed, and even if it contained no evidence of wrongdoing, the plaintiff’s lawyer could very likely find something that would be used against me. So talk only to Amy and my claims representative; other than that, suck it up.

After the initial flurry of activity, things subsided, and more than a year elapsed before I was deposed. For a grueling four hours, the plaintiff’s lawyer asked a lot of questions, but he did not hold my feet to the fire, and then that was that. It is often the case that these suits drag on for years, so I was taken by surprise when, in fall 2007, a trial date was scheduled for Oct. 27, 2008, in Middlesex Superior Court. In January 2008, I left my primary care practice after almost 30 years. I can’t say it was because of being sued, but I can’t say it was irrelevant either.

In September 2008, Amy and I resumed the process of reviewing records and discussing strategy. In early October, I was coached on how to testify: keep your feet on the floor, do not cross your legs or fold your arms. Don’t put your fingers together and pontificate. For heaven’s sake, don’t slump. Answers should be crisp and cogent, but do not hesitate more than three seconds before responding. Look at the jury. Don’t lose your cool during the cross-examination. And above all, relax and be yourself.

On Oct. 16, 11 days before trial, I got an urgent e-mail message from Amy. It turned out that the plaintiffs and their law firm had “irreconcilable differences.” These differences weren’t spelled out, but it appeared that the lawyers had decided they were not going to win the case. They couldn’t have figured this out four and a half years earlier? Before all this wasted time, the emotional anguish, and the more than $150,000 spent by my insurance company in the run-up to trial?

The plaintiffs, my patient’s children, refused to let their lawyers drop the case. I could imagine that they didn’t feel well served by this process. They met with their lawyers to resolve this, but neither side gave in. As this slowly unfolded, my mood turned from stoic resignation to a toxic muck of apathy and irritation.

On Oct. 23 everyone except me went in front of the judge. The plaintiffs’ lawyers asked to withdraw from the case, and the family requested a continuance, which would allow the case to be tried at a later time with a new set of lawyers. Amy opposed the continuance. The judge denied the continuance and ordered everyone to proceed with the trial as scheduled.

Just before Amy left, the children and their lawyers conferred again. The lawyers told them that they were unlikely to win and that they would have to pay for the expert witnesses if the case went forward. Finally, the family agreed to drop it, and they all went before the judge to seal the deal.

Amy called me. All in all, I thought I was pretty cool about the whole thing by now. The initial turbulent emotions had been squeezed out or tamped down, and I was ready for whatever happened. But when she told me the news, I started to cry."

The initial findings from the California Department of Public Health stem from an investigation ordered last month by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. He had voiced concern about a handful of birth defects, and the deaths of three infants, that occurred in children born in 2007 and 2008 to women who had lived in Kettleman City.

The potential cluster of birth defects also drew the attention of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which last week visited Kettleman City, a town of about 1,500 people in rural Kings County. Agency officials also toured the 1,600-acre Kettleman Hills landfill, which contains toxic chemicals and other waste and is four miles west of the town.

Despite fears of an environmental cause, the health department said Tuesday that its initial investigation had determined that the rate of birth defects in Kettleman City from 1987 to 2008 was only slightly higher than that of neighboring towns and in surrounding counties.

The chief deputy director of the state health department, Kevin Reilly, said an analysis of medical records and other data showed “no patterns to suggest there was a common underlying cause” for the defects, which included cleft palates and other abnormalities."

According to a new study, the 2010 Identity Fraud Survey Report, from the research company Javelin Strategy & Research, 7 percent of identity fraud victims this year reported identity thieves stole their health insurance information, up from just 3 percent last year.

So even though the actual total dollar amount of health care identity fraud didn’t increase meaningfully from 2008 to 2009, James Van Dyke, the president and founder of Javelin, said he expected to see more incidences of health insurance identity fraud showing up in next year’s study and beyond. “We’re seeing more criminal access to private medical records in our survey now, and therefore, we expect to see resulting increases in health care fraud in future years’ studies,” Mr. Van Dyke said.



Such health insurance identity theft occurs when someone impersonates someone else at a hospital or doctor’s office — using a stolen health insurance card or account number or even just personal information like a Social Security number or driver’s license – to get health care coverage for surgery or other treatment. People often learn they are victims of such fraud when they get a medical bill or a notice about what will be covered from their health insurance company.

The rise of this relatively new area of identity fraud (this year is the first Javelin has tracked annual shifts in such fraud) is mainly because of two factors, Mr. Van Dyke said: medical providers’ putting more records in more easily accessible electronic form, thanks to federal incentives to do so; and the large numbers of people unable to get health care coverage.

“Health care providers haven’t really focused as much on protecting the health care records, and with the incentives that are available for making these records electronic, we have a recipe for a growing problem,” he said. Plus, medical providers often will trust that patients without an insurance card are who they say they are if they have other proof, like a driver’s license, he said.

Such fraud is part of a broader rise in identity fraud — which Javelin defines as the unauthorized use of another person’s personal information for illicit financial gain — in the wake of the global economic downturn and high unemployment rates.

The study, which is based on a telephone survey in November and is co-sponsored by some financial services companies, estimated that the number of identity fraud victims in the United States increased by 12 percent, to 11.1 million adults in 2009, while the total annual fraud amount increased by 12.5 percent, to $54 billion.

Still, the average fraud resolution time dropped 30 percent, to 21 hours, partly because of increased consumer education and assistance from financial institutions, among other factors.

But according to Javelin, health insurance-related identity fraud is particularly troublesome because of the relative costs. The average identity fraud victim pays $373, while a health insurance fraud victim pays $2,228, and a health insurance fraud typically is about $12,100 in total, compared with $4,841 for an average identity fraud case.

In addition, because it’s a relatively new type of fraud, the health care industry doesn’t have processes and formulas in place for resolving such fraud quickly.

If you find yourself the victim of such fraud, Anne Wallace, president of the Identity Theft Assistance Center, a nonprofit group supported by the financial industry, recommended filing a police report and contacting the medical provider and your insurance company in writing, detailing how you were billed for services that weren’t for you and including a copy of the police report.

Resolution “does tend to happen, but it can take a lot longer than it does in other cases because it’s a relatively new phenomenon,” she said. Mr. Van Dyke, of Javelin, said he had encouraged the financial industry to help health care providers learn how to deal with such fraud.

Have you ever been a victim of health insurance-related fraud, and if so, how was the resolution process? If not, are you worried about such fraud and what tips do you have for not becoming a victim?"

Prescriptions, laboratory tests, studies, consults, reports and progress notes from all visits by patients to any Veterans Affairs hospital are stored in each patient’s electronic record.

With privacy constraints in place to prevent unauthorized access to electronic health records — a requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 — patients could get electronic copies of their own medical records and have them sent directly to a doctor, hospital or other designated recipient.

Currently, however, the various hospital and medical groups that have gone electronic “speak different languages and cannot transmit information between systems,” Dr. Atul Gawande, the Harvard-based surgeon and the author most recently of “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right” (Metropolitan, 2009), said in an interview. “Integrating the systems so that we can send information across the country is the holy grail.”

The Benefits

A digital account of one’s medical records can do far more than relieve doctors’ dependence on unreliable memories. It can also have these benefits:

?

Avoid duplication of tests, from blood tests to M.R.I.’s. If you’ve already been tested recently by one provider, the results can be accessed electronically by another doctor within the same system. This can sometimes be life-saving in a crisis situation. If a test has a built-in hazard, not having to repeat it enhances patient safety. Or if a test must be repeated, the doctor can see immediately whether an important change has occurred since the last test.

Reduce medical errors. Within a hospital system, having a record of complications that accompany a particular procedure can help the system identify and rectify the problem before more patients suffer needlessly. An electronic system could reduce pharmacy errors that result from misreading a doctor’s prescription and misplaced decimal points and warn of drug allergies and potential drug interactions in individual patients. If a drug is recalled, with an electronic record every patient on the drug can be alerted quickly.

?

Make surgery safer. Dr. Gawande said he had just finished four operations, each of which had more than two dozen things to do or think about afterward, like lab tests, blood clot checks, antibiotics, bed arrangements, nursing instructions and so forth. When he and his colleagues had to rely on memory, some important steps were usually forgotten. But with an electronic reminder all now get done.

?

Encourage better self-care. “Well-informed patients are better able to participate in their own care,” Dr. Steven Shea of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons said in an interview. If patients have access to critical parts of their health records, especially their test results, they may be “more likely to engage in healthy behavior and more likely to bring symptoms to the attention of their doctors,” Dr. Shea said, adding, “In my experience, the better informed patients are, the more efficient and productive the medical visit can be.”

?

Improve care of chronic illnesses. Fewer than half of patients with chronic ailments regularly take prescribed medications or get the periodic checkups their doctors recommend. An electronic system can alert the physician to noncompliance and when it is time for another office visit. Electronic reminders and prompts can help patients get better preventive care, Dr. Litvin said, like when they should have a colonoscopy, get a flu shot or get certain lab tests. Electronic records may also help to reduce waste in the system by identifying the most effective treatment regimens for common conditions.

Identify the right drug and dose. In the not too distant future, as DNA-based variations in drug responses are identified, electronic records will enable doctors to choose the most effective medication and dose for each patient. For example, in determining a safe and effective dose of the blood thinner Coumadin, months of risky trial and error could be eliminated by tailoring the dose to each patient’s unique genome.

The Concerns

Privacy concerns have been the main deterrent to “wiring” medical records. But Dr. Litvin notes that the information is password-protected, and that insurers and employers would not have access to a patient’s electronic medical record unless the patient authorized it. “The benefits to providing quality medical care way outweigh any privacy issues,” she said.

As with any innovation, there is a learning curve associated with establishing and using electronic records. “There was a lot of pain in adopting an electronic system,” Dr. Gawande said. “But now that it is up and running, none of us would go back, not for a minute. A well-designed system can dramatically improve medicine’s ability to get better results.”"

Re “Medical Paper Trail Takes Electronic Turn” (Personal Health, Feb. 23): Good medical records are the foundation of good care, and electronic medical records, if widely adopted, will ensure ready availability.

Regrettably, the quality of records is not vouchsafed by electronic records. Their use inhibits face-to-face contact of patient and doctor, and they too frequently form a checklist of symptoms lacking a coherent synthesis of the patient’s illnesses and rationale for treatment. Electronic records facilitate billing and record storage, but the crucial content of the medical record must come directly from the doctor-patient relationship and not the computer.

Cuomo, issued a subpoena seeking work records for many of the top aids to Pedro Espada Jr., the Senate majority leader.","Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo issued a subpoena to the New York State Senate on Thursday seeking the employment records of 10 Senate aides in the office of Pedro Espada Jr., the Senate majority leader, whose business and political activities are under scrutiny by Mr. Cuomo’s office and federal prosecutors.

Each of the aides, according to Mr. Cuomo’s office, were also involved with the Soundview HealthCare Network, a group of health care clinics in the Bronx founded by Mr. Espada, a Democrat.

Mr. Cuomo’s office filed a civil lawsuit on Tuesday against Mr. Espada, accusing him of siphoning millions of dollars from the clinics to pay for personal and campaign expenses. Investigators from Mr. Cuomo’s office and federal law enforcement agents raided Soundview’s offices on Wednesday.

Mr. Cuomo asked the Senate for time sheets, payroll records, records pertaining to travel and expenses, and records relating to job applications and hiring decisions.

The records cover several people who appear to have dual roles as Senate aides to Mr. Espada and employees or board members of Soundview. Mr. Cuomo claims that the Soundview board was filled with allies and family members of Mr. Espada’s and rubber-stamped millions of dollars in inappropriate expenditures.

“We want to know where these people worked and when,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. “We also want to know why they were hired and under what circumstances. It should be no surprise given the nature of these abuses that we would look to determine whether the misconduct reaches into the State Senate.”

Austin Shafran, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic majority, said the Senate would comply promptly with the subpoena.

“The Senate is reviewing personnel and travel records, and will satisfy the attorney general’s request once the documents have been collected,” Mr. Shafran said.

The subpoena appears to cover much, if not all, of Mr. Espada’s senior staff, including the senator’s director of outreach, his general counsel, his New York City director of community relations and several special assistants who act as senior advisers to Mr. Espada."

Mr. Bush is chief executive of Athenahealth, which offers electronic health records and billing services to physicians, using an Internet-based, software-as-a-service model. His argument is that the government incentive program, which begins next year, will, given its size and complexity, serve to subsidize traditional health software, which resides on the hard drives of personal computers and servers.

The big, old-line vendors like General Electric, Allscripts and Cerner, he contends, stand to gain more than the Web-based insurgents, like Athenahealth and others.

“It’s health care information technology’s version of cash-for-clunkers,” Mr. Bush said at a health care industry conference in Dana Point, Calif., which ended on Friday.

“Established technology is being given a federally funded new lease on life,” Mr. Bush said. “Traditional health software now is on Medicare, being kept alive like grandma.”

Mr. Bush is hardly politically disinterested, as the nephew and cousin, respectively, of two Republican presidents (yes, those Bushes). But he is not alone in making the observation that big government programs tend to favor big companies.

Still, even Mr. Bush said because the incentives to doctors, up to $40,000 over five years, will only be paid for “meaningful use” of the technology, it is an important step. The government’s definitions of meaningful use are phased in over years, but eventually include everything from tracking patient vaccinations and blood work to automated reminders to doctors of harmful drug interactions and the computerized reporting of patient data for public health programs.

“It’s real money for a pay-for-performance program,” he said. “And that will have an effect.”

On that point, Mr. Bush finds common ground with Dr. David Blumenthal, the national health information technology coordinator in the Obama administration, who also attended the conference. In his presentation and in an interview, Dr. Blumenthal emphasized time and again that the government program is less about technology than about changing the terms of trade in health care.

The government’s intervention in health information technology market, he said, is justified to correct a market failure. “The market doesn’t reward performance,” Dr. Blumenthal said.

In the current fee-for-service system, doctors and hospitals are paid for doing more – more visits, more tests, more surgeries. Quality and cost are not typically measured and compensated, outside some government pilot projects and a comparative handful of larger physician groups around the country.

The electronic health record, in Dr. Blumenthal’s view, is a tool – and yes, a stalking horse – for bringing measurement, data-based decision-making and accountability to the practice of medicine. The computerized patient record, then, is a step toward changing compensation of medicine and the economics of health care.

On Tuesday, for example, the administration announced $220 million in Beacon Community grants to 15 cities and regions across the nation to help them use health technology to deliver measurable improvements over the next two or three years. The grants are for efforts to combat chronic illnesses like diabetes and asthma, or problems like reducing the rate of hospital readmissions.

The purpose, Dr. Blumenthal said, was to “show, in a tangible way, what is possible in health with modern technology.” Later, he explained, “It’s much more about health than technology.”

Throughout the conference, speakers lamented that the recent health legislation only really addressed one pillar of heath care reform – access. It did not forcefully address the other two vital ingredients in reforming health care – cost and quality.

David Bowen, who just stepped down as the staff director for health policy on the Senate health committee, agreed that the legislation was “inadequate” in dealing with the cost and quality issues. But, he added, it was the most that could be done politically.

To advance the broader agenda of reform, Mr. Bowen pointed to the electronic health record initiative, which was part of the year-earlier economic stimulus package, not this year’s health reform legislation. Health information technology, Mr. Bowen said, had the potential to be a “game changer.”

He elaborated by saying that “meaningful use is on its way to becoming the two most important words in health care.”"

The need to get patients involved was made startlingly clear last month when the American Academy of Family Physicians, a national medical society devoted to primary care, and TransforMED, a nonprofit consulting firm created by the society to help physicians turn their practices into medical homes, published the first report on their national demonstration project. Beginning in 2006, 36 traditional primary care offices began adopting the hallmarks of patient-centered medical home practices. They installed electronic medical record systems and reorganized deeply entrenched scheduling routines. Teams made up of nurses, medical managers, physician assistants and doctors, rather than a single physician authority figure, began working with patients. And care was focused not on single acute episodes of illness but on the patients’ comprehensive and ongoing management.

As the study progressed, the researchers found that the vast majority of doctors’ offices could successfully incorporate most of the changes into their practice, and early signs of the model’s success were promising. Quality of care and preventive health ratings revealed small improvements. Office staff became more streamlined, efficient and satisfied. Most notably, physicians were more content than ever before with their work, despite still having to deal with an unchanged fee-for-service or managed care reimbursement system. The doctors’ enthusiasm persisted even after the study closed, with many maintaining contact with one another through a listserv and twice-yearly self-organized meetings.

Yet despite these successes, there was also one unexpected early finding: the patients were unhappy.

Yes, they were getting into their doctors’ offices more quickly and were being followed more closely than ever before, but many patients reported feeling disoriented. Some felt displaced as they saw the old one-to-one doctor-patient interactions replaced with one-to-three or one-to-four relationships involving not only the doctor but also a whole host of other providers. As offices switched from paper-based to electronic medical records, other patients reacted to the distracted clinicians who seemed more focused on learning the new computer system than on listening to them. Satisfaction fell because, like my friend, few patients were cognizant of, much less involved in, the changes going on around them.

In working so hard to adopt changes on their patients’ behalf, clinicians had temporarily lost their focus on the patients themselves.

“The Achilles heel of all of this is a lack of patient understanding and engagement,” said Dr. Terry McGeeney, a primary care physician and chief executive of TransforMED. “Patient-centered medical homes are a massive paradigm shift in how primary care practices function.” As one of the first national studies of patient-centered medical homes, “we were starting at ground zero, and we weren’t aware of what we needed to do other than support the physicians’ personal motivation.”

With the patient survey results in hand, the researchers began encouraging medical practices to involve patients in the changes. They asked clinicians to discuss the premise of medical homes with their patients and encouraged them to create patient advisory councils, groups of patients who would meet regularly with clinicians to discuss how their needs might be better served.

“We were surprised by how many patients wanted to be part of it,” said Dr. Barbara Saul, a primary care physician in Troy, Mich., who was initially part of the study. “Patients would say over and over, ‘It’s about time you started these kind of changes.’ ”

The researchers also created a five-minute, 20-question assessment survey that asks patients for their views on patient-provider communication, clinician access and care of the whole person. Practices could use the survey regularly to gauge the effects of any changes, adjusting and refining what they do according to the patients’ experiences and not what the clinicians might believe was most important to them.

“Nowadays a lot of patients end up getting things done to them, almost forced on them,” said Dr. Joseph Mambu, a practicing family physician in Lower Gwynedd, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. “I think if we could see a situation the way a patient does, a lot of the things we do would not be done.” Based on his experience with the national demonstration project, Dr. Mambu went on to help create a national coalition of patient advocacy groups, payers and providers, the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative, devoted to creating more medical homes across the country.

While Dr. McGeeney and his co-investigators believe that such work and ongoing research will yield even more significant results in terms of improving the quality and decreasing the costs of primary care, the lesson from this first experiment is clear.

“The model can improve quality while becoming more efficient, but practices need support,” Dr. McGeeney observed. “Providers need to want to provide this kind of care, payers need to pay for this kind of care and, most importantly, patients need to demand and expect this kind of care.”

<p>","For several years now and with a growing messianic fervor, physicians and health care experts have been responding to the need to deliver more efficient and better primary care with one response: patient-centered medical homes.

Not long ago, I found myself doing the same with a friend who prides himself on being a well-informed patient. But instead of an overwhelmingly enthusiastic or even mildly interested response, my friend stared at me blankly.

''What in the world are you talking about?'' he finally asked. ''A hospice? A halfway house? Some kind of group home for patients?''

I explained that a patient-centered medical home can be any primary care doctor's office, but it is run with a different philosophy. Care is team-based, preventive and comprehensive, rather than one-on-one, fee-for-service or managed. Record keeping and sharing is seamless and electronic, rather than unwieldy and paper-based. Clinicians from the team are easily accessible in person, on the phone or via the Internet within 24 hours, rather than hidden behind labyrinthine automatic answering services and overbooked clinic schedules.

My friend suddenly became very interested.

Call it a P.R. issue, an information disconnect or simply an unfortunate choice of a name, but in all the discussions about patient-centered medical homes, one group of individuals has been conspicuously missing: the patients themselves. And it's hard not to notice the irony; in a model of care premised on the strength of the patient-doctor relationship, few people other than doctors and experts are even sure what it is or how it affects their care.

The only question has been how Big Blue, a company geared to deal with big corporations, would cater to the messy, fragmented market of physicians.

I.B.M. provided its answer Thursday morning. It’s not going in alone, but as a technology partner. The offering will be a Web-based subscription service, but enhanced by I.B.M. data-mining technology and tweaked by the scientists in its research labs. And I.B.M. is going into electronic health records selectively, and not yet marketing to small practices with just a few doctors.

I.B.M.’s partner is a subsidiary of the insurer Aetna, ActiveHealth Management, which makes disease management software and personal health records. ActiveHealth will provide the user record and decision support technology, while I.B.M. provides the cloud computing services and data-intelligence technology.

The offering will tap I.B.M. researchers for advanced features like matching patients to specialists with the best measured record of results for similar patients.

Physicians will not have to install new software in their offices. It will run on computers in I.B.M. data centers and be accessed by doctors with a Web browser on personal computers. They will pay monthly fees for the service, from several hundred dollars to nearly $1,000 per doctor, I.B.M. says, depending on the number of physicians in a medical group and on what features they use.

“This is our first software-as-service play in clinical health care,” said Robert Merkel, vice president for health care in I.B.M.’s global business services unit.

I.B.M. and ActiveHealth are rolling out the service first with Sharp Community Medical Group, a health network with more than 600 primary care and specialist physicians, based in San Diego.

Even though the government is providing incentive payments of up to up to $44,000 a doctor to adopt digital patient records, many physicians remain skeptical.

In surveys, the cost of buying and the cost of maintaining computerized records are consistently the top two reasons why say they have not adopted them, notes Lynne Dunbrack, an analyst at IDC Health Insights.

The approach taken by I.B.M., and others is to try to improve the economics and reduce the technical headaches for doctors, by offering patient records on the Web as a subscription service.

“The last thing doctors want to do is be in the information technology business, loading software and taking care of server computers,” Ms. Dunbrack said.

I.B.M., for now, will be marketing its offering to large and mid-sized medical groups, down to 100 or so doctors, Mr. Merkel said. Yet 75 percent of the nation’s physicians practice in offices of 10 or fewer doctors.

The leading vendors of Web-based offerings to smaller practices include eClinicalWorks and Athenahealth, said Wes Rishel, an analyst at Gartner."
94,614,2010-08-14T00:00:00Z,article,Pharmacists Take Larger Role on Health Team,541989c238f0d86afc9a1a10,"subject:Drugstores, subject:Medicine and Health",Business,0.0,None,Drugstore pharmacists are taking on more responsibility for monitoring patients with long-term illnesses.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/health/14pharmacist.html,1118,Drugstore pharmacists are taking on more responsibility for monitoring patients with long-term illnesses.,"They are being enlisted by some health insurers and large employers to address one of the fundamental problems in health care: as many as half of the nation’s patients do not take their medications as prescribed, costing nearly $300 billion a year in emergency room visits, hospital stays and other medical expenditures, by some estimates.

The pharmacists represent the front line of detecting prescription overlap or dangerous interaction between drugs and for recommending cheaper options to expensive medicines. This evolving use of pharmacists also holds promise as a buffer against an anticipated shortage of primary care doctors.

“We’re going to need to get creative,” said Dr. Andrew Halpert, senior medical director for Blue Shield of California, which has just begun a pilot program with pharmacists at Raley’s, a local grocery store chain, to help some diabetic patients in Northern California insured through the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

Like other health plans, Blue Shield views pharmacists as having the education, expertise, free time and plain-spoken approach to talk to patients at length about what medicines they are taking and to keep close tabs on their well-being. The pharmacists “could do as well and better than a physician” for less money, Dr. Halpert said.

Some health insurers and large employers already pay for programs called medication therapy management, which typically involve face-to-face sessions between pharmacists and patients in retail stores or clinics. Pharmacists can be paid to track patients, monitoring cholesterol or blood glucose levels, for example, or prodding customers to change their diets or exercise. UnitedHealth Group has recently started working with pharmacists and health coaches at the Y.M.C.A. to counsel diabetic patients.

The idea of using pharmacists in this way began to gain popularity in 2006 when some Medicare plans started covering medication therapy management programs, paying $1 to $2 a minute to pharmacists to review patients’ medicines with them; this year, about one in four people covered by Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will be eligible, according to agency estimates. For example, a Medicare Part D plan covered Ms. Gelinas’s medication management session at Barney’s pharmacy.

More employers and insurers also pay for pharmacists to advise patients, a role that the new health care law encourages with potential grants for such programs. In Wisconsin, for example, community pharmacists and some health plans have banded together to create a joint program, the Wisconsin Pharmacy Quality Collaborative, to standardize medication therapy management and ensure quality care.

Meanwhile Humana, which first paid for pharmacists to work with Medicare patients, expanded its coverage a few years ago. About a third of the 62,000 pharmacies in its network offer these services, and the insurer says it is studying whether a pharmacist seeing a patient in person has more impact than a phone call.

The advent of these services has spawned a new industry of medication therapy management companies to run clinical pharmacy programs for health insurers, contracting with pharmacists and tracking the financial and health outcomes of their services. One such company, Mirixa, founded in 2006 by the National Community Pharmacists Association, does business with more than 40,000 pharmacies nationwide. Pharmacists and others see these joint efforts as vital to remain competitive with mail-order pharmacies.

One of the first places where retail pharmacists began to expand their role was Asheville, N.C., where studies validated the services. “We really positioned the pharmacist as coach,” said Fred Eckel, executive director of the state’s pharmacist group.

In one recent study of 573 people with diabetes, 30 employers in 10 cities waived co-payments for diabetes drugs and supplies for those employees or family members willing to meet regularly with a pharmacist. People in the study, financed by the drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, took part in at least two sessions with pharmacists who helped them track their blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels and offered diet and exercise advice. After a year, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels typically improved — and saved an average $593 a person on diabetes drugs and supplies.

But the new relationships have stirred concerns. Federal regulators have recently accused chains like Rite Aid and CVS Caremark of inadequately protecting health records.

And groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians, say pharmacists should be careful not to usurp the physician’s role. “I’m concerned that people are thinking about this in terms of ‘either or,’ and that’s the wrong approach,” said Dr. Lori J. Heim, the academy’s president. “It’s an ‘and’ approach.”

Michelle A. Chui, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy, said that pharmacists do not want to compete with doctors, but merely provide more information “so the physician has a more in-depth picture.”

Still, the pharmacy business benefits. Barry S. Bryant, owner of Barney’s in Augusta, said expanding to include a wellness center where pharmacists hold medication management sessions and monthly health classes attracted more customers.

Today, Barney’s fills an average of 1,000 prescriptions a day, up from 300 seven years ago, with about a third of his customers covered by Medicaid and another third by Medicare, he said.

The business growth at Barney’s has even prompted Mr. Bryant and Mr. Pope to start their own education company, CreativePharmacist.com, that teaches other pharmacies how to introduce in-store services.

“When we get involved with chronic care patients, their outcomes improve,” Mr. Pope said. “But, at the same time, they are improving our bottom line.”"

Verdugo, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. “We had second thoughts. We hope to issue a final regulation this fall.”

The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a watchdog group, estimates that more than five million people have been affected by breaches of medical information in the last 18 months.

Causes include the theft of laptop computers, the loss of paper records, the posting of data on Web sites and the curiosity of hospital employees snooping for information on sports stars and other celebrities.

Congress increased privacy safeguards when it provided tens of billions of dollars to promote the use of electronic health records under the economic recovery bill signed by President Obama in February 2009.

In writing the temporary rules, Ms. Sebelius closely followed the text of the law except in one important respect: Health care providers and health insurance plans would have to notify patients of a privacy breach only if they found that the violation posed “a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individual.”

“No notification is required” if a hospital or an insurer believes, after a risk assessment, that the patient will not be harmed, the rules said.

Deven McGraw, director of the Health Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties group, said the standard proposed by the administration was severely flawed.

“Harm is in the eye of the beholder,” Ms. McGraw said. “How does a hospital or an insurance company know whether an improper disclosure will harm an employee’s chances for promotion or endanger a victim of domestic abuse?”

Defending its proposal, the Department of Health and Human Services had said that some kind of “harm threshold” was essential. Otherwise, it said, consumers might be flooded with notices warning about innocuous or insignificant violations of privacy.

Some senior members of Congress said they had explicitly considered and rejected a standard like the one adopted by Ms. Sebelius. “This is not consistent with Congressional intent,” they said in a letter to her.

The letter was signed by six lawmakers including Representatives Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Joe L. Barton of Texas, the senior Republican on the committee; and Pete Stark, Democrat of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.

Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said hospitals and insurers were often reluctant to notify patients. “Few things could be more damaging to an institution’s reputation than having to admit that it has lost or somehow allowed others to intrude into its patients’ private medical data,” she said.

In July, Colorado notified 110,000 Medicaid recipients that information about them was on a computer hard drive taken “without permission” from a state government office. The data indicated whether, for example, women were receiving prenatal care or treatment for breast or cervical cancer.

In the last nine months, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee has notified nearly one million people that their privacy could be compromised by the theft of 57 computer hard drives from a call center in Chattanooga. The hard drives included recordings of telephone calls, Social Security numbers and diagnostic information about some subscribers.

In Massachusetts, four hospitals acknowledged this month that paper records for thousands of their patients had been improperly thrown out at a public dump north of Boston. The records included results of tests performed by pathologists and clinical laboratories.

“We were shocked and outraged,” said Nancy A. Coley, a spokeswoman for one of the hospitals, Holyoke Medical Center. “We wondered how our records could be out in the Boston area 90 miles away. We found that the records came from a billing agency used by a group of pathologists who did work for the hospital.”

In California, Ralph E. Montaño, a spokesman for the State Department of Public Health, said officials had substantiated 2,093 violations of medical privacy in the last 20 months, including 26 “malicious breaches.”

The department has imposed $1.1 million in fines on six hospitals and is still investigating hundreds of cases, Mr. Montaño said.

Courtney Berlin, a spokeswoman for Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, Calif., said several hospital employees were recently disciplined for “using Facebook to post their personal discussions concerning hospital patients.”

The University of Texas at Arlington said it had recently notified 27,000 people of a possible “data compromise” involving their prescription drug records. The information, including drug names and diagnostic codes, was stored on a computer file server that was not properly secured, university officials said."

Starting in 2002, Dr. Sheth’s inclination to spend lots of time with patients apparently melded with a desire to make tons of money. With privileges at Advocate South Suburban Medical Center, Ingalls Hospital and a third unidentified hospital, he was able to gain access to personal and insurance information about the patients.

He then prepared handwritten notes, which he faxed to outside billing firms, about bogus treatment of those individuals. Those firms sent formal billings to Medicare and about 30 private insurers.

When it came to Medicare, Dr. Sheth used two codes, each of which represents critical cardiac treatment and is reimbursed at a high rate. He sent 14,800 billings over five years to Medicare alone, billing for 24 hours or more of work every day of the year. His use of the codes represented a disproportionate use of them in the entire United States, and more than all the doctors in some states, according to the defense.

It allowed for the purchase of multiple homes, numerous bank accounts and investments, nothing especially covert or overseas. When caught in 2007, Dr. Sheth — a man who says he engaged in Hindu prayers and meditation for nearly three hours each morning as opposed to the normal 45 minutes — confessed to getting $13 million in illegal payments.

He was also found in possession of more than 600 uncashed checks amounting to $6.8 million, most of which the government argued was the result of fraudulent billings.

The defense team of James Fieweger and Anton Valukas argued that Dr. Sheth suffers from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it hired a psychiatrist to bolster the claim. Steven Dollear, an assistant United States attorney, called that poppycock, pointing out that the phony billings ending abruptly after the government confronted him.

Dr. Sheth simply “wanted to practice medicine his way, but he also wanted to enjoy financial success,” Mr. Dollear said. Weirdly, the doctor did not bill for some of his bona fide patients.

On Aug. 10 he got a more lenient sentence than the government had sought, stiffer than the defense had desired. His license is suspended indefinitely and all his ill-gotten gains and homes and cars will be forfeited. The government has received $11 million so far. His marriage is over.

Lucky man, the tale got scant attention in the Chicago news media, not much beyond a short Tribune article whose alteration of a government press release was so slight, it’s surprising that United States Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald didn’t get a byline.

Then there is our health-care system, in which no bells and whistles went off amid such flagrant fraud. It took five years to figure it out. It’s enough to give a taxpayer heart palpitations."

In 1890, it was cameras. Today, cookies.","As the adage goes: Everything old is new again.

On the one hand, consumers often benefit from newfangled gizmos — be they cameras, tape recorders or cellphones. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of technology has often left legislators and regulators racing to play catch up.

The F.T.C., for instance, just published a report in which agency experts concluded that data-collection techniques on the Web had outdistanced user privacy control. So it was only natural that Mr. Leibowitz looked to tradition and invoked the 19th-century law review article, which essentially laid the legal foundations for protecting Americans’ privacy rights.

(My colleagues Tanzina Vega, Edward Wyatt and Verne Kopytoff have written in depth this month about the F.T.C. report, its proposed framework for increasing consumers’ privacy choices and its implications for the online marketing industry).

Mr. Warren and Mr. Brandeis wrote, for example, that privacy, an intangible right, was as important as more tangible common law rights, like the ownership of private property. People have the right, they wrote, to control dissemination of their personal thoughts or images. People also have “the right to be let alone.”

In a similar fashion, the F.T.C.’s report recommends that Internet and mobile app users receive better control over who sees, collects and shares information about their electronic behavior — like, say, the Web sites they peruse or the terms they plug into search engines. Indeed, the commission proposed a “do not track” mechanism that would allow consumers to opt out of “behavioral advertising,” the kind of marketing that tailors ads to a consumer’s personal track record.

This is not the first time since snapshot photography that new technology has inspired legal experts to rethink privacy protections.

“The laws haven’t really kept pace with the unbelievable developments,” says Jessica Rich, deputy director of the trade commission’s bureau on consumer protection.

As an example, Ms. Rich cited the 1960s, when deeper credit reporting allowed companies to use advanced database technology to collect consumers’ financial information. Once legislators began to understand how such databases could affect people’s ability to obtain mortgages, housing and even jobs, she said, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The 1970 law allowed consumers to retrieve and correct credit information about themselves.

Indeed, privacy regulation is often reactive, says William McGeveran, a privacy scholar at the University of Minnesota Law School.

Take the Video Privacy Protection Act, enacted by Congress in 1988, after a local newspaper in Washington obtained and published the video rental records of Robert Bork, a Supreme Court nominee. The so-called Bork law, one of the country’s strongest privacy statutes, prohibits the disclosure of personally identifiable rental information without consumer consent.

“One of the comical attributes of privacy regulation is — a lot of it is responsive to fire alarms,” says Professor McGeveran.

Indeed, over time Congress has increased privacy regulation in different industries, he says. There’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, for one, that in 1996 established certain federal protections for personal health information. And the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which required financial service companies to notify customers about their information policies and allow them to opt out from having their data shared with unaffiliated parties.

“Maybe now it’s online privacy’s turn to have more of a direct regulatory intervention,” Professor McGeveran says.

The trade commission’s report proposes new industry practices to enhance online privacy choices for consumers. For those to take effect, however, either the interactive advertising industry would have to increase self-regulation or Congress would have to enact a law enabling the commission to enforce new rules.

Some industry groups are already stepping up transparency.

In October, the Digital Advertising Alliance, a coalition of trade groups, introduced an “advertising option icon”— a logo that Web sites can display to indicate that they collect consumer data and that they allow people to opt out of behavioral advertising. Next month, some data collection firms in that coalition are introducing the Open Data Partnership, a program that will allow consumers to edit their information profiles on certain sites or opt out of being tracked by participating companies.

But Christopher Soghoian, a privacy researcher and graduate student at Indiana University, says most Web sites don’t allow consumers to opt out of tracking.

Companies “promise they won’t use the data they collect for the purpose of picking the individual ads they are showing you,” he says, “but they don’t actually offer to stop collecting data about you.”

AND there’s another potential problem, Mr. Soghoian says.

Web sites often deposit cookies on consumers’ computers to track online preferences and activities. The F.T.C.’s recommendation for an opt-out mechanism would play on that idea with a privacy cookie, encoded in people’s browsers, that would alert advertising networks to users’ privacy choices.

But a few smaller companies have already moved beyond cookies, Mr. Soghoian says, with a technique called “device fingerprinting.” That advanced technology can follow online behavior — not by using cookies but by tracking signals that are specific to a person’s individual laptop or mobile device.

“That’s not something you can opt out of,” Mr. Soghoian says. “There’s no way to delete my fingerprint because there’s no way for me to delete my phone or my computer.”

Once again, technology forges ahead. Not much has changed since 1890."

The affected hospitals were Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital and two affiliated clinics. The “overwhelming majority” of those who had their data stolen were patients, the agency said.

The theft of electronic files, which contained both patient health records and medical information about workers — with names, addresses and Social Security numbers — occurred on Dec. 23, when an information-management company’s van was left unlocked and unattended in Manhattan, the hospitals corporation said.

On Wednesday, the agency started mailing notification letters to the victims, in 17 languages, announcing an information hot line and customer care centers at both hospitals, and offering free credit monitoring and fraud resolution services for one year. Those interested in the offer have 120 days to register. The notification text is also available online.

The hospitals corporation said it had taken “decisive steps to protect the individuals who are potentially affected,” even though there is no evidence the information, contained on computer backup tapes that were being delivered to “a secure storage location,” has been accessed or misused. It also said that the data is stored in a program “that would make it difficult for someone without technical knowledge to access the private information.”

The hospitals corporation has filed suit to hold the vendor, GRM Information Management Services, responsible for covering all damages related to the loss of the data."

By 2020, the number of people with multiple chronic conditions is expected to increase to 81 million, up from 57 million in 2000.

The new report, “Multiple Chronic Conditions: A Strategic Framework,” was created to provide “a road map for the nation to foster changes in the health care system that can reduce poor health outcomes, improve patients’ quality of life and reduce costs,” said Dr. Anand K. Parekh, an assistant secretary of health who was in charge of the report.

“With an aging population, the persistence of risk factors for disease and the marvels of modern medicine, more people are living with multiple chronic conditions,” Dr. Parekh said in an interview. “New care models are needed to provide coordinated care.”

The Problems

It’s not just the number of conditions people have, nor the number of people who have them. Because of the way medicine is typically practiced these days, people with multiple chronic diseases commonly receive disjointed, often conflicting care. That can lead to preventable hospitalizations and a host of avoidable complications, adverse reactions to treatment, and duplication of expensive, sometimes hazardous tests.

Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help doctors treat patients with many individual chronic conditions, but not for treating common combinations of them. As a result, what is recommended for one disease may counteract what should be done for another.

Dr. A may prescribe something for a heart problem that reacts badly with what Dr. B prescribed for the same patient’s asthma or what Dr. C prescribed for arthritis or osteoporosis.

When no one doctor coordinates and oversees a patient’s total care, or when patients neglect to report all the other prescribed and over-the-counter remedies they take, medical cocktails can become Molotov cocktails.

Often, patients have no idea that a particular treatment is the cause of distressing new symptoms, which can result in an emergency room visit, hospitalization and a raft of costly tests. Even without such emergencies, patients with multiple conditions are often subjected to the same tests by different doctors, contributing further to needless medical expense.

Medications can often be avoided with self-care activities like reducing salt, eating lots of vegetables and fruits and getting regular exercise.

But the doctors’ offices seldom have anyone on staff to help patients develop such routines and stick with them. And medical insurance rarely covers the services of nutritionists and exercise physiologists.

And Some Solutions

Dr. Mary E. Tinetti, a geriatrician at the Yale School of Medicine, says patients with multiple conditions should always be asked what their goals are: to live as long as possible, to be as functional as possible or to be as free of symptoms as possible?

“There’s always a trade-off; you can’t have it all,” Dr. Tinetti said in an interview. “You have to decide what’s most important to you and let the doctors and nurses know your goal. You have to ask, ‘Given all my diseases, what’s the best way to reach my goal?’ ”

When more than one disease is involved, she said, “what may be good for a given disease may not be good for the patient.” The doctor’s job is to choose “a combination of treatments that is most likely to help and not hurt.”

And since “every treatment a patient gets may make something else worse,” Dr. Tinetti said, when a new remedy is prescribed, the patient or caregiver should ask, “What’s this going to do to my other health problems?”

Dr. Parekh stressed the importance of having a single doctor — usually a primary care physician — to serve as “the quarterback of care for individuals with multiple chronic conditions,” the overseer who can coordinate all the patient’s conditions, medications, tests and specialists.

Electronic health records, which store all a patient’s information in one place, are critical to enhancing communication between providers and avoiding adverse drug interactions, said Christine Vogeli, a health policy expert at Massachusetts General Hospital. And after any hospitalization, she said, patients should have “a face-to-face visit” with their primary care doctor, who can reconcile any contradictory treatments and reduce the risk of rehospitalization.

In one medical model being fostered under the new federal health care law, so-called accountable care organizations of family physicians and specialists (and sometimes hospitals) join forces to improve care and reduce costs, with financial rewards for those who meet performance goals.

In another model, several primary care physicians may practice together, assisted by nurse practitioners who periodically check on patients to be sure they follow prescribed remedies and to uncover problems before they become medical crises.

But patients also have a critical role, Dr. Parekh said. They need to learn as much as they can about their conditions; tell the doctor about every medication and test taken, along with behavioral health problems like mental illness and substance abuse; and avoid risk factors like poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol abuse and lack of physical activity.

“The same risk factors that cause a chronic condition can also make it worse,” he said."

In January, the French start-up Withings introduced a Wi-Fi-enabled cuff that can take your blood pressure and pulse and that connects to an iPhone to synchronize the data with records kept online. The data can be securely stored on a personal page on the Withings Web site or with other personal health record, or P.H.R., service providers, like Google Health and Microsoft’s HealthVault, where it can then be accessed by your doctor.

In February, Entra Health Systems announced a deal with the Swedish mobile phone company Doro to make its MyGlucoHealth service available on their senior-friendly cellphones. With a small device, blood glucose level readings can be sent by text message to a secure MyGlucoHealth portal, which provides instant advice to users on what to eat. MyGlucoHealth, which the company introduced in 2008, is also compatible with Google Health and HealthVault.

Though MyGlucoHealth is already available around the world using various smartphones and simple mobile phones with Bluetooth, early promotion and partnerships centered on Britain, Australia, Germany, the United States and India. The service is about to be heavily promoted in Asia. John Hendel, chairman of Entra Health Systems, said it would be available in Hong Kong on March 29, in partnership with PCCW, and in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea over the next three months.

“Asia has a very high number of people with mobile phones and with diabetes,” Mr. Hendel said. “It’s a market where there is a lot of genetic predisposition to diabetes, the health care system is typically underfunded and paid for by the patients, and so by coming up with a great cost-effective solution it allows us to capture a big market piece that is just as important as the U.S. market, if not more important.”

A report in November by research2guidance estimated there were more than 17,000 mobile health applications designed for smartphones and that many were aimed at and being adopted by health care professionals. It forecast mobile and wireless health care services would expand significantly to reach 500 million mobile users, or about 30 percent of an estimated 1.4 billion smartphone subscribers worldwide, by 2015.

Microsoft’s HealthVault and Google Health, introduced in the United States in 2007 and 2008 respectively, offer similar open platforms that allow people to store and manage their health information, including immunizations, disease history and prescriptions in one place, with access to the records possible via various devices or mobile applications.

“We decided to integrate with Google Health and HeathVault because, based on their potential, a lot of people are using them as a destination site,” Mr. Hendel said. “So instead of having to click on our site and then someone else’s site, they’re acting as depository of connected links.”

HealthVault already integrates 170 health care applications, ranging from one that helps triathletes monitor their training and diet to software for managing diabetes, and the platform works with about 90 medical devices, said Mark Johnston, Microsoft’s international business development lead, from Sydney.

HealthVault’s software development kit has been downloaded 30,000 times. “I think this is the leading indicator of what will come forward,” Mr. Johnston said. “And as we continue to land new contracts and open new markets, our value proposition to our development community is only enhanced because we become the distribution channel and they can go to the market with us.”

While Google Health is at least for now confined to the United States, HealthVault has slowly rolled out its platform internationally, linking with local partners. It was deployed in Canada in 2009 through a partnership with Telus, in Germany though a deal with Siemens and in Britain through a deal with Nuffield Health in 2010.

In October, HealthVault also signed an agreement with a large systems integrator in China, iSoftStone, and the two companies are now focusing on a government program in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province.

“They have a very specific ambition which involves diabetes and hypertension patients, and we’re bringing to market a set of applications and connected devices that are being driven by our partners in China,” Mr. Johnston said. “The entire experience will be localized to their needs to also build a high level of consumer trust.”

He added that HealthVault had been concentrating since the beginning on patients with long-term conditions and chronic diseases. “And we’re trying to go really deep on application pairings with devices to treat those patients because there is a very strong value proposition for those,” Mr. Johnston said, given that governments and other health organizations incur most of their costs from these patients.

So far, adoption of online personal health records by consumers has grown slowly. According to a survey by Knowledge Networks conducted in the United States last year, 10 percent of the public now uses P.H.R.’s, compared with 3 percent in 2008. A similar proportion of doctors said they offered P.H.R. tools to their patients.

Jay Chandran, associate research director of health care at Frost & Sullivan, a research and consulting firm, said he believed patients needed to have an incentive to maintain their online personal health records. Otherwise individuals were unlikely to find the motivation to keep their medical records up to date.

“In my opinion, P.H.R. products will become more successful if data can be captured at the transaction level itself, that is, if a P.H.R. can be a subset of electronic health records, where health care service providers provide the real time information,” Mr. Chandran said. “If the records are maintained and entered by health care service providers, the credibility and utility of such data is higher.”"

So instead of being an entrepreneur, she will become an employee of a large corporation working 36 hours a week — half the hours her father and grandfather worked.

Indeed, emergency room and critical-care doctors work fewer hours than any other specialty, according to a 2008 report from the federal Department of Health and Human Services.

Her decision is part of a sweeping cultural overhaul of medicine’s traditional ethos that along with wrenching changes in its economics is transforming the profession. Like Dr. Dewar, many other young doctors are taking salaried jobs, working fewer hours, often going part time and even choosing specialties based on family reasons. The beepers and cellphones that once leashed doctors to their patients and practices on nights, weekends and holidays are being abandoned. Metaphorically, medicine has gone from being an individual to a team sport.

For doctors, the changes mean more control of their personal lives but less of their professional ones; for patients, care that is less personal but, as studies have shown, more proficient.

Older doctors view these changes with considerable ambivalence, among them Dr. Dewar’s 90-year-old grandfather and 61-year-old father, although both supported Dr. Kate Dewar’s decisions and were thrilled about the birth of her twins.

“My son and I had deeper feelings for our patients than I think Kate will ever have,” Dr. William Dewar II said over lunch at a diner in Honesdale, about 30 miles northeast of Scranton. Munching on a club sandwich, Dr. William Dewar III gestured toward the diner’s owner, who had greeted them deferentially.

“I’ve had three generations of his family under my care,” he said as a waitress brought his usual Diet Coke without being asked. “Kate will never have that.”

In a separate interview, Dr. Kate Dewar said that treating chronic conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol — a huge part of her father’s daily life — was not that interesting. She likened primary care to the movie “Groundhog Day,” in which the same boring problems recur endlessly. Needing constant stimulus — she e-mails while watching TV — she realized she could not practice the medicine of her forebears.

“I like it when people get better, but I’d rather it happen right in front of my eyes and not years later,” she said. “I like to fix stuff and then move on.”

Her attitude is part of a gradual distancing between doctors and patients. Doctors were once revered, but a host of intermediaries — insurers, lawyers, the Internet, growing patient needs and expectations — have intervened, to the point that many patients now see doctors as interchangeable. Younger doctors are deciding that the personal price of being at their patients’ beck and call is too high, while acknowledging that teams of doctors can offer a higher quality of care. So they are embracing corporate, less entrepreneurial and less intimate roles in part for the uninterrupted family time they bring.

“Look, I’m as committed to being a doctor as anyone. I went back to work six weeks after my boys were born. I love my job,” said Dr. Kate Dewar. “But I was in tears walking out of the house that first day. I’m the mother of twins, and I want to be there to feed them, play games with them or open presents with them on Christmas morning. Or at least I want the option to do those things without fearing I’ll be called back to the hospital.”

The pain of that first week’s separation was lessened somewhat because she worked in the hospital’s new pediatric emergency department. “I felt better knowing that at least I was taking care of somebody else’s babies even if I couldn’t be with mine,” she said.

Three Generations of M.D.’s

The story of the Dewars demonstrates how these trends have played out over nearly seven decades.

Dr. William Dewar II opened his practice 67 years ago at his home in Catasauqua, Pa., an Allentown suburb, with his wife, Thelma, as his lone nurse and assistant. He delivered babies and set broken bones. Sick patients showed up on his doorstep at all hours, with some sleeping over. When they needed to be hospitalized, Dr. Dewar oversaw their care. Patients paid cash — $2 for an office visit and $3 for a house call, fees that covered most needed medicines.

Thelma Dewar handled the bills and laboratory tests, often by cooking urine samples on the stove before analysis.

“I loved my practice. Totally loved it,” Dr. Dewar said. “You were in touch with the patients. They were part of your family.”

The culture of medicine at the time was decidedly macho. Residents routinely worked 120 hours a week, often staying at the hospital for days at a time. Indeed, the term “residency” comes from the first such program at Johns Hopkins University, established around the start of the 20th century, where doctors lived in a dormitory next to the hospital, a monastic life inimical to women who wanted children. As the residency requirement took hold nationally, the share of female doctors, already low, fell further. Dr. William Osler, the founder of the residency program, celebrated such sacrifices.

“What about the wife and babies if you have them? Leave them,” Dr. Osler wrote. “Heavy are the responsibilities to yourself, to the profession and to the public. Your wife will be glad to bear her share of the sacrifices you make.”

After 25 years in Catasauqua, the Dewars moved to the Honesdale area, and their oldest son joined the practice — which by then had moved to an office building. But working outside the home meant that Dr. William Dewar III saw less of his children than his father had seen of his — though he attended more of their sporting events. He tried to make a point of eating dinner with the family, but often failed because his sickest patients spent more time in the hospital as fewer people died at home. Even when he did make it home for the meal, he often left afterward. He was on call seven days a week, limiting vacations.

“We always joked that as soon as Dad’s butt hit the chair for dinner, his beeper would go off,” Dr. Kate Dewar said.

A Changing Field

But even as the two men tried to keep their practice the same, the world around them kept shifting. Their patients’ medical needs grew steadily, and specialists began to take over the more complicated procedures.

After his father retired at 75, Dr. Dewar merged his practice with those of four other doctors, eventually moving into a large building that once housed the town’s bowling alley. Thousands of paper records occupy much of the building’s space, and 35 employees handle the billing and other clerical functions.

And the burden of trying to be all things to all of his patients became unmanageable. In 2006, after Wayne Memorial Hospital hired hospitalists — doctors who specialize in taking care of hospitalized patients — Dr. Dewar finally gave up hospital rounds.

For his hospitalized patients, the change meant putting their trust in a doctor who knew them less intimately but was more available and more adept at hospital care. “My patients are getting better care now in the hospital,” Dr. Dewar said.

And the change saved him hours of work each week. “It meant getting off the hamster wheel,” he said.

In her third year of medical school, Kate Dewar shadowed clinic doctors treating patients with everyday illnesses. It was just the kind of medicine her father practices: advising the obese to lose weight and the smokers to quit, and prescribing cholesterol and hypertension medicines again and again. “I hated it, and I felt terribly guilty,” she said. She called her father and broke the news that she wanted to work in a hospital. He was very supportive, she said.

Her father also remembered being both envious and disappointed. “On the one hand, it bothers me that the generation of doctors that my daughter is in doesn’t work as many hours and isn’t willing to do the stuff that I did,” he said. “On the other hand, I’m almost a little jealous.”

Such mixed feelings are common among older doctors, many of whom have been unable to sell or even give away their practices because younger doctors are not willing to work the hours required. Indeed, Dr. William Dewar III’s practice has hired nurse practitioners recently, in part because it cannot recruit doctors.

Photo

Merritt Hawkins, a top doctor recruitment firm, reported that 51 percent of the positions it filled in the past year were for hospitals, up from 14 percent eight years ago. And even a growing share of the jobs the company filled in private practices included income guarantees from hospitals. Young doctors surveyed by Merritt Hawkins listed quality of life well above finances as the most important factor in their job searches, and just 1 percent said they were willing to practice alone. Many young doctors will not take jobs that require them to be on call.

Almost every hospital in the country has vastly expanded its medical staff. Lehigh Valley Health Network in Allentown, where Dr. Kate Dewar currently works, has gone in seven years from 100 to 500 employed doctors.

A Different Pace

A day spent with Dr. Dewar in the emergency room of Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest had the feel of an episode of “E.R.,” far different from “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” which her father grew up with. The attending physician was Dr. Rezarta Lloyd. The two women had complete control over a section of the emergency room reserved for the most serious cases, and there were many that day: a young woman with a deep gash on her hand that Dr. Dewar stitched closed, an older woman with suffocating fluid around her heart, and a 35-year-old man with a high fever, abdominal pains and an altered mental state.

The two doctors ordered a CT scan of the man’s midsection, and they stood next to a computer terminal and toggled through images of his internal organs, deeply concerned.

“Everything looks so inflamed,” Dr. Dewar said as Dr. Lloyd nodded. “Look at the stomach. Look at the wall there. What is wrong with this guy?”

The more challenging the case, the better the women liked it. Each tended to collect rare and difficult interventions like merit badges. Standing beside the display screen, Dr. Dewar told a story about having a patient whom she thought might need a tracheotomy, a rarely done procedure in which a tube is put into a patient’s throat to prevent suffocation. She had a “trach kit” placed in the patient’s room just in case.

While attending to another patient, Dr. Dewar noticed a commotion outside the patient’s room and yelled at her colleague on duty, playfully threatening bodily harm to anyone else daring to do “her” tracheotomy.

The tracheotomy story was interrupted by another phone call from one of the hospital’s radiology technologists, whom Drs. Dewar and Lloyd had sparred with all day. The two had sent a patient whose damaged eye was bleeding, leaking fluid and bulging. The doctors had described the patient’s condition in the order they submitted for the CT scan, but the technologists rarely seemed to read those instructions closely, Dr. Dewar complained.

“No,” she said. “We’re looking for a globe rupture.”

Then a 22-year-old man showed up with flu symptoms. Dr. Dewar, pregnant at the time, kept her distance while Dr. Lloyd went to his bedside and, later in the day, prescribed antivirals.

“My big fear is patients with the flu,” Dr. Dewar explained. “Pregnant women were the ones who died from H1N1, so Dr. Lloyd protects me by seeing them herself. I had my flu shot and all that, but if I don’t have to risk it, I won’t.”

Pregnant residents are another sign of medicine’s shifting culture. Residency hours and practices were once so grueling that few doctors deliberately became parents during those years. But in an effort to reduce fatigue-related errors, residency hours were reduced in 2003 to 80 per week. Last year at Johns Hopkins, the birthplace of the residency program, more than a third of the women in one internal medicine residency program became pregnant or were the mothers of young children — an outcome that would have been unimaginable to William Osler.

Still, carrying twins on a job that requires hours of walking between rooms was not easy. On a nine-hour shift in her 29th week, she drank three liters of water and snacked constantly on cheese crackers.

But when her shift ended, Dr. Dewar went home and put up her feet. And no pager threatened her rest — something her father has rarely experienced."

WHAT does Medicaid have in common with “I Dream of Jeannie,” “Lost in Space” and “Get Smart”? They all made their debut in 1965. Although we enjoy watching reruns of these classics, the television networks have updated their programming. The federal government should do the same.

In recent years Washington has taken an obsolete program, which covers health care for low-income Americans, and made it worse through restrictive rule-making that defies common sense. It is biased toward caring for people in nursing homes rather than in their own homes and neighborhoods. It lacks the flexibility to help patients who require some nursing services, but not round-the-clock care.

If we were designing a health insurance program for low-income families today, we would use a much different model to drive efficiency and innovation — one that recognizes that the delivery of health care is fundamentally personal and local.

Time and again states like Wisconsin have blazed the path in Medicaid — from giving individuals greater control over their care to expanding the use of electronic medical records — while the federal bureaucracy has lagged behind. Just now Washington is discovering accountable care organizations (networks of doctors and hospitals that share responsibility for caring for patients and receive incentives to keep costs down) and “medical homes” (a model in which one primary-care doctor takes the main responsibility for a patient).

Wisconsin has created a database of claims and payments that gathers information from all insurers, including private companies and the state Medicaid program. It allows people to compare cost and quality across providers. We have asked Washington to add its data to our database, but it has not done so."
103,543,2011-04-23T00:00:00Z,article,Family Physician Can't Give Away Solo Practice,5400b0b738f0d841b2f383d3,"subject:Doctors, subject:Careers and Professions, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care",National,0.0,None,"Dr. Ronald Sroka has been in practice for 32 years, and has a roster of 4,000 patients, but with costs going up and reimbursements going down, he is looking for an out.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/health/23doctor.html,2439,"Dr. Ronald Sroka has been in practice for 32 years, and has a roster of 4,000 patients, but with costs going up and reimbursements going down, he is looking for an out.","He tried to sell his once highly profitable practice. No luck. He tried giving it away. No luck.

Dr. Sroka’s fate is emblematic of a transformation in American medicine. He once provided for nearly all of his patients’ medical needs — stitching up the injured, directing care for the hospitalized and keeping vigil for the dying. But doctors like him are increasingly being replaced by teams of rotating doctors and nurses who do not know their patients nearly as well. A centuries-old intimacy between doctor and patient is being lost, and patients who visit the doctor are often kept guessing about who will appear in the white coat.

The share of solo practices among members of the American Academy of Family Physicians fell to 18 percent by 2008 from 44 percent in 1986. And census figures show that in 2007, just 28 percent of doctors described themselves as self-employed, compared with 58 percent in 1970. Many of the provisions of the new health care law are likely to accelerate these trends.

“There’s not going to be any of us left,” Dr. Sroka said.

Indeed, younger doctors — half of whom are now women — are refusing to take over these small practices. They want better lifestyles, shorter work days, and weekends free of the beepers, cellphones and patient emergencies that have long defined doctors’ lives. Weighed down with debt, they want regular paychecks instead of shopkeeper risks. And even if they wanted such practices, banks — attuned to the growing uncertainties — are far less likely to lend the money needed.

For patients, the transition away from small private practices is not all bad. While larger practices tend to be less intimate, the care offered tends to be better — with more preventive services, better cardiac advice and fewer unnecessary tests. And the new policies that may finally put Dr. Sroka out of business are almost universally embraced — including wholesale adoption of electronic medical records and bundled payments from the federal Medicare program that encourage coordinated care.

“Those of us who think about medical errors and cost have no nostalgia — in fact, we have outright disdain — for the single practitioner like Marcus Welby,” David J. Rothman, president of the Institute on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia University, said of the 1970s TV doctor.

Dr. Sroka has not taken a sick day in 32 years. After his latest partner left in September, he was unable for five months to schedule any time off until another local doctor volunteered to cover for him. His income and patients depend upon his daily presence. This resiliency is part of a tough-minded medical culture — forged in round-the-clock residency shifts, constant on-call schedules, and workplaces in which revered doctors made decisions and staff members followed orders — that is fast disappearing.

Had he left a decade ago, Dr. Sroka might have been able to persuade a doctor to pay $500,000 or more for his roster of 4,000 patients. That he cannot give his practice away results not only from the unattractiveness of its inflexible schedule but also because large group practices can negotiate higher fees from insurers, which translates into more money for doctors.

Building Relationships

Handsome, silver-haired and likable, Dr. Sroka is indeed a modern-day Marcus Welby, his idol. He holds ailing patients’ hands, pats their thickening bellies, and has a talent for diagnosing and explaining complex health problems.

Many of his patients adore him.

One of them, Alicia Beall, 53, came in for a consultation after a pain in her foot grew worrisome. She has been seeing Dr. Sroka for 30 years, and he quickly guessed that she was suffering plantar fasciitis, a painful inflammation.

“So take off your shoe,” Dr. Sroka said. She did, and Dr. Sroka lifted her foot.

“If it’s plantar fasciitis, it’s usually right there,” Dr. Sroka said and pressed his thumb into her heel.

“Ow! Don’t do that,” Ms. Beall said and smacked him with a magazine. They both laughed.

They discussed possible treatments for her foot and for swelling in a hand, including steroid injections. But he settled on a prescription for diclofenac, an aspirinlike pain pill. While writing his notes, Dr. Sroka asked Ms. Beall how her husband liked his new job. He told her to return if the pills failed.

“We’ll do the steroid injections another time,” Dr. Sroka said. “We never would have gotten the insurance company to pay for them all. When you bill for both a medical and a surgical visit, they always deny one.”

Patients and doctors often complain that appointments are rushed, but the time that doctors spend with each patient — 16 to 20 minutes, on average — has remained largely unchanged for years.

Instead, patients have gotten sicker and treatments more complex. Half of American citizens have a chronic disease like high blood pressure or diabetes, and a quarter have two or more such conditions. For diabetes alone, the American Diabetes Association’s recommendations for basic medical care extend for nine single-spaced pages. For many of their patients, doctors must increasingly rush through a blizzard of questions and tests, leaving little time for the kind of intimate chit-chat for which doctors and patients alike yearn. Some patients must schedule two or three office visits to have all of their medical issues addressed.

In a later interview, Ms. Beall said that Dr. Sroka “has real conversations with you, and he remembers what’s going on in your personal life. I really like that.” At appointments, she is assured of seeing him and not a colleague she does not know. Even his assistants know her on sight.

“At some medical offices, you feel like you should pull a number like at the deli,” she said. “But Dr. Sroka’s office is small-town medicine, and I like that. I’m dreading the day when he retires. I know it’s coming.”

Two Paths

Dr. Tim Biddle, 43, worked with Dr. Sroka between 2001 and 2005, making about $120,000 annually. Born and raised in Eastern Maryland, Dr. Biddle had intended to become a country doctor. But more than $100,000 in school debt and a desire to attend his four children’s soccer games led him to reconsider. Doctors in less populated areas tend to work longer hours seeing patients than doctors in more populated areas, according to government studies.

“Ron was working his butt off during the day seeing patients, and then he has the business of the practice to run at night,” Dr. Biddle said. “He’s got to balance the books, pay his employees and negotiate the reimbursement rates.” Like many doctors who own small practices, Dr. Sroka relies on his wife, Nancy Sroka, for much of his bookkeeping.

Instead of taking over the practice, Dr. Biddle left for a job as a physician at the Defense Department, where his salary is higher, his hours fewer and his vacations more frequent.

“I don’t work nights, weekends or holidays,” he said. “I get all the government holidays, and whether I see 3 or 30 patients a day, I get paid the same thing. And I never get stuck at the office because I’ve got too many patients, too much paperwork or because I have to go to the E.R. to see a patient.”

Dr. Biddle said that he missed the intimacy he once had with patients but suspected that he provided better care now because he practiced near other doctors, many of them specialists, whom he can consult on difficult cases. “When I was with Ron, we didn’t have 10 other doctors pulling the charts and providing the level of peer review that we have here,” he said.

Dr. Sroka was once deeply idealistic about his profession and used to speak with great feeling about a higher purpose to his work. He still fondly recalls standing on his front porch and stitching up neighborhood kids injured in evening ball games. But when insurers stopped paying extra for after-hours care, he started telling those kids to go to nearby emergency rooms. Like so many in his generation of doctors, the nickel-and-dime efforts of insurers have left him deeply bitter.

Dr. Sroka estimated that he was making about $250,000 annually in the 1990s — high for a primary care doctor — because he practices in an affluent region and his patients had generous insurance plans. Even as late as 2006, his income was $324,000, according to records he provided for this article — double the median income for family practice doctors that year.

But in 2008, his income dropped to $97,000. It rose last year to $130,000, but only because he worked about a third more hours. Growing practice expenses played a significant role in this decline.

Walking into Dr. Sroka’s practice, it is easy to see why. On most days, visitors are greeted by Betty Alt, a sweet 68-year-old who knows many patients intimately. Patients’ medical folders — many bulging with decades of aches and test results — are retrieved by Jennifer Simmons, a 41-year-old office assistant who spends much of her day faxing. Before appointments, patients often give a urine sample to Chris Minner, 58, a medical technician.

Altogether, Dr. Sroka employs 10 part-time employees, or the equivalent of five full-time workers. He does not provide his staff members with health insurance. His expenses amounted to $420,000 last year, or about $200 an hour. Most of his patients have either Medicare or CareFirst, the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, which pays him $69 (including a $20 co-pay) for most consultations. At that rate, he breaks even at three visits an hour and needs a fourth to turn a profit.

While Medicare reimbursements have been unchanged for 10 years, private reimbursements have declined twice in that period while his costs — and those of family practices across the country — rose steadily.

Keenly aware of these numbers, Dr. Sroka is decidedly cheap. When the toilet in his office broke recently, he went to Home Depot to get the replacement parts himself. When his office flooded, he spent the weekend mucking it out. His weight scale for patients is a battered, ancient disk that he kicks out from under his desk. The posters lining the walls are yard-sale Norman Rockwell reproductions.

Dr. Sroka said that he did not deserve anyone’s sympathy. Frugality and wise investments have left him with a net worth of about $5 million, which includes his office building, he said. He cannot bring himself to join a large group practice or work for a hospital because he opposes their growing use of nurse practitioners for primary care.

His eldest son, Ron Jr., sells group health insurance plans — the kind of product that is putting his father out of business.

“My dad’s way of delivering medicine is going to be extinct very soon,” Ron Sroka Jr. said in an interview. “He’s a dinosaur.” The money and time needed to buy and master an electronic health record system will alone be too much for his father, he said.

“My honest opinion is that one day he is going to lose it and just walk off the job,” Ron Sroka Jr. said. “There will be a final straw, a new mandate, and he’ll just say, ‘I’ve got to close my doors.’ He wants to maintain contact with his patient base because they’re like family to him, but he’s not going to be able to do it.”

The Personal Touch

Mary Pat Dorsey, 64, came in for an appointment after having heart palpitations, a pain in her jaw and a bad headache. A friend was concerned that she might be suffering a heart attack, so she called Dr. Sroka. He told her to come to his office instead of going to the emergency room.

Dr. Sroka gave her an electrocardiogram, took her pulse and blood pressure, and listened to her heart with his stethoscope. After a series of questions (was she at rest or active, sweaty, light-headed, fatigued or still taking estrogen replacement therapy?), he learned that she had been taking Excedrin for migraines.

“That has caffeine in it. It helps with the headache problems, but can bring on heart ones. That may be the thing that’s setting this off,” Dr. Sroka said. Still, he insisted that she soon get a stress test “because in this day and age, we’ve been ignoring too many women with symptoms of ischemic heart disease.”

He counseled her to go to the hospital in the future if she got chest pains with drenching sweat, light-headedness, or nausea and fatigue. “But I think you’re good for another 100,000 miles,” a line he used countless times that day.

In a later interview, Mrs. Dorsey said that she passed the stress test “with flying colors” and that Dr. Sroka had on several occasions over the previous 32 years saved her from unnecessary trips to the emergency room and thousands of dollars in medical bills “because he knows me.”

“I’m having trouble with menopause and having weird things happen to me, and he knows that,” she said. “He takes the time with me. He knows my family. He talks about fishing, and that makes me comfortable. He lives around the corner from my daughter. He grew up and came right back and did his practice around everybody he knows.”

“He’s just special.”"

Two studies have found that consumers could save more than $300 a year by switching to the right plan. But to pick the best plan, you need to be able to estimate how much you use services like texting, social media, music streaming and sending photos.

You may not know how to answer or be able to express it in megabytes, but your service provider can. Although some of this information is available online, it’s generally not readily exportable — you can’t easily cut and paste it into a third-party Web site that compares prices — and it is not put together in a way that makes it easy to calculate which plan is best for you.

Under my proposed rule, your cellphone provider would give you access to a file that includes all the information it has collected on you since you owned the phone, as well as the current fees for each kind of service you use. The data would be in a format that is usable by app designers, so new services could be created to provide practical advice to consumers. (Think Expedia for calling plans.) And this virtuous cycle would create jobs for the people who dream up and run these new Web sites.

Before businesses complain about how hard it would be to comply with such a regulation, they should take a look at the federal government’s Blue Button initiative. This protocol is already providing a secure way for veterans and Medicare beneficiaries to share their medical history with health care providers they trust. (The name “Blue Button” refers to an icon that users click to get the data.)

The Blue Button initiative is already spawning private sector applications. Northrop Grumman has developed a smartphone app giving veterans access to their health records and the ability to receive wellness reminders on their phone. HealthVault, a health care management site from Microsoft, also permits Blue Button users to tap into their medical information service. The ability to access these kinds of services could save lives in emergencies.

If the government can manage to collect and release personal information in a secure and useful way, so can private companies, which will empower consumers to become better shoppers.

Let’s return to the smartphone example. Once a phone owner can provide use data to third-party Web sites, those outfits (BillShrink.com is one) can pinpoint the best pricing plans. Thinking of upgrading your phone? The third-party sites can warn you whether your use is likely to increase, based on the experiences of other consumers who made the same switch.

If personal data is accompanied by detailed pricing information, as I discussed in my last column, consumers will be more aware of how they really use products and how much fees really cost them. And transparent pricing will give honest, high-quality providers a leg up on competitors who rely on obfuscation. All of this will help stimulate the best kind of economic growth.

THE potential applications are endless. Supermarkets, for example, have already learned that they can attract many customers to their shoppers’ clubs by offering discounts to club members. This allows the stores to know what they buy and to target coupons based on their purchases. Shoppers can opt out — but only at the cost of losing the discounts.

So let’s level the playing field. Why not give you, the consumer, something in return for participating? Require that the supermarket make your purchase history available to you. Before you know it, a smart entrepreneur is likely to devise an app that will direct you to cheap and healthy alternatives that can slim your tummy and fatten your wallet. Apps could not only save money; they could also warn shoppers with allergies, for example, that they are buying foods that contain ingredients to which they are sensitive, like nuts or gluten.

The ability of businesses to monitor our behavior is already a fact of life, and it isn’t going away. Of course we must protect our privacy rights. But if we’re smart, we’ll also use the data that is being collected to improve our own lives.

I hope that American companies follow the lead of their British counterparts and cooperate in a “mydata” program. If they don’t, we should require companies to tell you what they already know about you. To paraphrase Moses, let’s ask them to “let my data go.”"

And that raises questions about medical care in America. For those who can afford it, what do they get for their money? Is it worth it? And for the rest of us, who cannot afford this level of care, is it fair and ethical for doctors to be doing this? Or is concierge care contributing to the growing gulf between the wealthy and everyone else?

COSTS AND BENEFITS Concierge medical care is nothing new. In places like Florida, with a high concentration of Medicare patients, some upper-middle-class retirees pay extra fees so they can see a doctor when they need to.

MDVIP, which has 450 concierge doctors in 34 states, charges patients $1,500 to $1,800 a year. Their doctors are each limited to 600 patients, whereas, the company says, most primary care physicians serve at least 2,000 patients. It says appointments with doctors “start on time and last as long as necessary” and can usually be made the same day or the next one. The company’s fee is for the extended care and comprehensive annual physical and wellness plan, but its doctors still bill the patient’s insurance company for procedures.

The international, around-the-clock programs take concierge medicine to a different level. Their primary goal is to offer an extra level of oversight to make sure that participants are getting the proper level of care whenever they need it.

Dr. Miles J. Varn, chief medical officer at PinnacleCare Private Health Advisory, which charges annual fees of $1,500 to $25,000, said the starting point for all patients was a complete review of all health records with an emphasis on finding gaps in care.

“We have physicians who look for omissions of care or deviations from standard care,” Dr. Varn said. “That record travels with them around the world.”

In promoting themselves, the plans say their doctors know each patient’s health conditions intimately and are able to discuss it with another doctor anywhere in the world.

Dr. Daniel Carlin, founder and chief executive of World Clinic, which charges $20,000 to $75,000 a year on average, said he recently had to intervene and stop a patient from getting the wrong procedure. The client was at a hospital in Florida where the doctors wanted to do bypass surgery for a blocked vessel. Dr. Carlin said the proper care was putting in a stent, and the difference was months of pain and recovery for the patient and tens of thousands of dollars for the hospital.

“You’re holding up a shield and saying, ‘We’ll weigh everything before we move forward,’ ” Dr. Carlin said. “With the primary care guy gone, the average patient isn’t being treated.”

IS IT WORTH IT? Despite reports about the decline in the number of family physicians and the increase in the hours the remaining ones work, many wealthy people are reluctant to pay extra for health care.

Dr. Varn said more than half of the company’s members were in a program that costs $10,000 a year, or about $800 a month — on top of whatever private insurance members may have. “How much do you pay to have your lawn mowed every year?” he asked. “Why wouldn’t you pay to get the same advice on your health? People think having great insurance means having great health care and that’s not the case.”

Beyond personalized primary care, the main selling point for high-end plans is access to top specialists when needed. Yet it is difficult to determine just how much shorter the wait is for the specialist.

“We regularly would engage with our clients to facilitate and get them to the appropriate specialist,” said Dr. Sean O’Mara, founder and president of Guardian 24/7 and a former Army doctor who was on call when the president or top Cabinet members traveled to South Korea. “We have an extensive Rolodex of medical specialists that we’re familiar with.”

Mark Murrison, president of marketing and innovation at MDVIP, said: “When the doctor makes that personal call to the specialist, that has a meaningful impact on getting that patient into see the physician quicker than they would be able to on their own.”

Beyond that, these companies argue that they help members locate the right doctor, something they would have more trouble doing on their own.

FAIRNESS DEBATE Unlike professions where money is a primary goal, doctors are obligated by their ethical code to provide care for people in need. This becomes an issue when their practices are confined to the wealthy, and it elicits complaints that concierge medicine caters to the elite.

“This isn’t fair,” said Dr. Carlin, who worked as refugee camp doctor and in an emergency room before starting World Clinic. “I’m a small solution to a vast health care problem.”

The American Medical Association’s policy on concierge care — or what it calls retainer practices — states that it is part of the “pluralism in the delivery and financing of health care.” But the A.M.A. also says these retainer practices “raise ethical concerns that warrant careful attention, particularly if retainer practices become so widespread as to threaten access to care.”

But some of the doctors involved in these practices argue that some variation will eventually be available to people who are not wealthy. “The solutions we’re developing right now are very expensive ones, but they’re going to migrate down to even the poorest people in the world,” Dr. O’Mara said.

He said one of Guardian 24/7’s members had underwritten a project to make a ready room mobile and put it in a free medical clinic in Northern Virginia. The company hopes that top specialists can be available remotely at the clinic.

Others were less sanguine about the shift to concierge medicine. “My response has been helpful to me and my patients, but it hasn’t addressed in any meaningful way the larger policy issue,” Dr. Glazer said.

And that is the bigger issue: whether these services for the wealthy can be translated to make the medical system better and more efficient."

Access to prescription records, IMS Health says, helps pharmaceutical companies market efficiently to doctors whose patients would most benefit from specific drugs.

Now the justices are to decide whether the Vermont law is constitutional.

But with the recent headlines about privacy invasion — the PlayStation hack followed a recent breach at the online marketing company Epsilon that exposed e-mail addresses of customers of Citibank, Walgreens, Target and other companies — the Vermont case is tapping into a much broader conversation about consumer protection and informed consent.

The case raises questions about who is collecting, managing, storing, sharing and selling all that data. Just as important, privacy advocates say, it raises questions about whether data brokers are adequately safeguarding it.

People generally don’t have much control over who collects and sells information about them. Moreover, says Christopher Calabrese, a legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, they also don’t even know the names of the data brokers who compile those electronic profiles.

And, so, consumer advocates are setting their sights on Big Data.

“Without government intervention, we may soon find the Internet has been transformed from a library and playground to a fishbowl,” Mr. Calabrese testified in March during a Senate hearing on consumer privacy, “and that we have unwittingly ceded core values of privacy and autonomy.”

There are a few laws, like the Video Privacy Protection Act, that prohibit businesses from releasing personally identifiable records, like video rental histories, without customer consent. The Digital Advertising Alliance, a coalition of online marketing groups, introduced a program last year that notifies consumers about online tracking and allows them to opt out of advertising tailored to them.

The Vermont law amounts to a kind of do-not-call option for doctors who may welcome visits from pharmaceutical sales reps but don’t want drug marketing based on their own prescription records.

That marketing practice is possible because pharmacies, which are required by law to collect detailed information about prescriptions they fill, can sell doctor-specific prescription records to data brokers. (According to federal privacy regulations, personal information about patients, like names and addresses, must be removed before the records can be sold for marketing.) Firms like IMS Health then combine the records, and pharmaceutical reps often use them to tailor presentations to individual doctors.

The central concern is privacy — of both doctors and their patients. While pharmacies remove the names of patients before selling the records, those names are replaced with unique codes that track patients over time from doctor to doctor, according to the Vermont complaint. That means data firms could create a profile that includes a person’s prescriptions as well as the names of the pharmacies and dates at which the person picked up the medications, says Latanya Sweeney, a visiting professor of computer science at Harvard.

“It ends up building a detailed prescription profile of individuals,” says Professor Sweeney, whose research on data re-identification was cited by several briefs in the case. “Those extended profiles tend to be very unique.”

The concern, she says, particularly in a small state like Vermont, is that a nameless prescription record could theoretically be enough to identify someone who might not want others to know that he takes, say, anti-depressants. Moreover, Professor Sweeney argues, data miners could collate those files with public information, like voter registration and hospital discharge records, to link prescriptions to specific people.

Federal health privacy regulation, she says, does not protect patient records once they have been de-identified. Nor does the law prohibit re-identification.

But IMS Health says it isn’t aware of any case of re-identifying patients whose prescription records were de-identified in accordance with federal rules. The company says it doubly encrypts each patient’s identity and gives the encryption keys to several third parties — meaning that no single entity can decode a file by itself, says Kimberly Gray, chief privacy officer at IMS Health.

The company typically sells combined reports that show how many patients received a certain drug from a certain doctor, but not the specific drugstores those patients frequent, Ms. Gray says. IMS never uses public information or outside data sets to try to re-identify patients, she says, and when it does provide encoded patient histories to others for research purposes, it prohibits those third parties from making such attempts.

“We would never want to re-identify someone,” Ms. Gray says. “No good can come from that.”

Still, it is hard to prevent people from trying to re-identify patients, says Lee Tien, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties group that filed a brief in support of Vermont. It would be easier, he says, if Congress passed a law that went further than Vermont’s, giving people the right to consent before their encrypted prescription records were sold for marketing purposes.

“In Vermont, the doctor can decide,” Mr. Tien says. “But we’d prefer it if the patient were able to say, ‘Don’t sell my data.’ ”"

They see limited potential beyond a few marquee examples, like Google in Internet search and online advertising.

The McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, is coming down on the side of the optimists in a lengthy study to be published on Friday. The report, based on nine months of work is “Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition and Productivity.” It makes estimates of the potential benefits from deploying data-harvesting technologies and skills.

The McKinsey research unit, for example, says the value to the health care system in the United States could be $300 billion a year, and that American retailers could increase their operating profit margins by 60 percent.

But the study also identifies challenges. One hurdle is a talent and skills gap. The United States alone, McKinsey projects, will need 140,000 to 190,000 more people with “deep analytical” skills, typically experts in statistical methods and data-analysis technologies.

McKinsey says the nation will also need 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired. The report points to the need for a sweeping change in business to adapt a new way of managing and making decisions that relies more on data analysis. Managers, according to the McKinsey researchers, must grasp the principles of data analytics and be able to ask the right questions.

“Every manager will really have to understand something about statistics and experimental design going forward,” said Michael Chui, a senior fellow at the McKinsey Global Institute.

The study estimates that the use of personal location data could save consumers worldwide more than $600 billion annually by 2020. Computers determine users’ whereabouts by tracking their mobile devices, like cellphones. The study cites smartphone location services including Foursquare and Loopt, for locating friends, and ones for finding nearby stores and restaurants.

But the biggest single consumer benefit, the study says, is going to come from time and fuel savings from location-based services — tapping into real-time traffic and weather data — that help drivers avoid congestion and suggest alternative routes. The location tracking, McKinsey says, will work either from drivers’ mobile phones or GPS systems in cars.

Personal location data raises privacy concerns. Both Google and Apple, for example, have faced protests recently for collecting location data without most users’ knowledge. The McKinsey report says such services should require that users have a choice and opt-in to use them, but the report does not deal with privacy issues in detail.

The sizable projected payoff for consumers, some experts say, is not surprising. “Much of the benefit of innovation always flows to consumers,” said Martin Baily, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who was an adviser on the study. “So the large consumer surplus makes sense.”

In health care, the biggest slice of the $300 billion gain is expected to come from more effectively using data to inform treatment decisions. The tools include clinical decision support to assist doctors, and comparative effectiveness research to make more informed decisions on drug therapy.

For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Kaiser Permanente save millions of dollars a year in treating many patients with high cholesterol with generic statins instead of branded statins, like Lipitor. But such tailored treatments require electronic health records for tracking results, and most of the nation’s hospitals and physicians still use paper records.

Skeptics say the economic payoff from harnessing big data sets is mostly wishful thinking so far. The nation’s technology-assisted increase in productivity began in 1995 and continued through 2004, having trailed off since, despite investments in data analytics.

“The big dividend mostly hasn’t arrived yet,” said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University.

The McKinsey authors say that the big-data trend is just getting under way. It will take years, they say, before the gains show up in the economic statistics, just as it did for computers to prove they were engines of productivity.

“But it’s clear that data is an important factor of production now,” said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute."

One particularly egregious case involved information about 1.7 million patients, staff members, contractors and suppliers of Bronx hospitals and clinics operated by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the New York public health agency. Their electronic files were stolen from an unlocked van belonging to a record management company.

The affected patients got the disquieting news that their medical and personal information, like Social Security numbers, had been violated when their health care providers notified them under federal rules.

Showing just how lax security can be, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services said two weeks ago that the agency had found dozens of vulnerabilities in systems to protect records of patients at seven large hospitals in New York, California, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia and Missouri. Auditors cited such problems as personal information that was not encrypted and was stored on computers that could be easily used by unauthorized users.

Auditing teams are now inspecting eight more hospitals, said Lori Pilcher, an assistant inspector general at Health and Human Services. The hospitals are not being identified to avoid alerting hackers, she said.

Another big breach was reported in March on the official Web site by Health Net, a California-based insurance company, which notified 1.9 million health plan members that records with their personal information were missing.

Health Net said I.B.M., which was managing its information system, told the insurer that the records could not be found.

“The health care industry is not as vigilant as they should be about protecting private information in a patient’s medical records,” said Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican who is co-chairman of the Bipartisan Privacy Caucus in the House.

Mr. Barton knows from personal experience. His own records after a heart attack, along with several thousand others from a research project at the National Institutes of Health, were “on a disk in a laptop in somebody’s trunk that disappeared,” he recalled. “I was stunned.”

The Obama administration has levied a string of stringent penalties for egregious violations of patient rights under the most commonly cited law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, of 1996. Health information is supposed to stay private under those rules, but research has shown that it is not that difficult to connect names and addresses to nominally anonymous data with Internet searches and computerized matchups.

The Office of Civil Rights at Health and Human Services, which took over enforcement of the law, imposed a $1 million fine on Massachusetts General Hospital in March after a hospital employee left paper records of 192 patients on a Boston subway train. The hospital agreed in a settlement, without admitting wrongdoing, to report twice a year on its efforts to tighten patient protections.

Earlier this year, the civil rights office fined a Maryland health plan, Cignet Health, $4.3 million, saying that it had denied patients the right to see their own records in violation of HIPAA provisions. It was the first civil penalty levied under the HIPAA law. “We have ramped up our enforcement,” said Georgina C. Verdugo, director of the civil rights office.

But Dr. David Brailer, a Bush appointee as the first national coordinator of health information technology, is skeptical about whether such efforts will curb security breaches. “We can’t just lock health care data away — because of its role in lifesaving treatment,” Dr. Brailer said.

He said that even with the best technology it would be hard to make health systems secure. “It’s a huge challenge. Break-ins and hacks are unfortunately going to be part of the landscape,” he said.

One protection, he suggested, would be laws to make it illegal for an insurer or employer to discriminate against a person based on information about health conditions like H.I.V./AIDS, cancer and mental health problems.

As a model, he pointed to the antidiscrimination law to prevent the misuse of genetic information that was passed with bipartisan support in the Bush administration. He also said he believed the laws should say “patients own the data, period, and decide what happens to it. The patient should be able to say to Hospital X: ‘send my data to Hospital Y because I’m changing hospitals,’ “ he said.

Today, the information belongs to whoever possesses it, under ideas inherited from 17th-century English common law, he said. “If it gets into your database, essentially you own it,” he added, “and you can pass it on.”

“Today HIPAA makes no sense,” Dr. Brailer added. “The law didn’t anticipate a world where your data passes through many, many hands.”

Wes Rishel, a longtime health care analyst for Gartner, the technology consulting firm, and an adviser to the national coordinator’s office, has a similar view. “Your ability to control access to your information is a horse that is already out of the stable,” he said. “What is really needed is legislation that controls use of it.”

On that score, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have shown that at least 30 people and organizations have access to the health data of a typical person with private insurance through an employer. They range from pharmacies and drug companies to an employer’s wellness programs and a spouse’s self-insured employer.

“Only you, your doctor and hundreds of others know,” said Latanya Sweeney, a health privacy expert at Harvard and Carnegie Mellon who is also an adviser to the office headed by Dr. Mostashari.

Since HIPAA was enacted there has been “an explosion in data sharing,” Ms. Sweeney said. “And after electronic records are widely adopted, there will be another big explosion.”"

When Google Health was introduced in 2008, Marissa Mayer, a Google executive, said it would be a “large ongoing initiative” that the company hoped would attract millions of regular users.

But Google Health never really caught on. In a posting on the company’s blog on Friday, Aaron Brown, senior product manager for Google Health, wrote that the goal was to “translate our successful consumer-centered approach from other domains to health care and have a real impact on the day-to-day health experiences of millions of our users.”

Yet, after three years, Mr. Brown said, “Google Health is not having the broad impact we had hoped it would.”

In the drive to apply information technology to health care, personalized health records are the element that relies most heavily on individual motivation and efforts. They are controlled by the consumer, and require individuals to put in, update and edit their health data. By contrast, the federal government has begun a five-year campaign to accelerate the adoption of electronic patient records by hospitals and doctors, with the incentive payments to physicians topping $40,000."

Candidates' Stances on Health Care Mask Their Records as Governors,5400c02238f0d841b2f38a9b,"subject:Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010), persons:Perry, Rick, persons:Romney, Mitt, persons:Huntsman, Jon M Jr, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, subject:Presidential Election of 2012, subject:Reform and Reorganization, persons:Obama, Barack",National,0.0,Politics,"The three current or former governors running for president are united in their commitment to repealing President Obama's health care law, but have had divergent approaches.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/us/politics/04governors.html,1527,"The three current or former governors running for president are united in their commitment to repealing President Obama’s health care law, but have had divergent approaches.","When Mr. Perry succeeded George W. Bush in December 2000, about 22 percent of Texans had no insurance, second only to New Mexico. After Mr. Perry’s decade in office, Texas now claims the highest uninsured rate, at 26 percent, as well as other distinctions like the lowest rate of prenatal care.

Regardless, Mr. Perry has offered few initiatives to extend coverage. Instead, under the banner of state sovereignty, he has waged a running battle against the ballooning cost and structure of Medicaid, which covers more than a third of Texas children. At various points, Mr. Perry and the Republican-controlled Legislature have cut Medicaid benefits and provider reimbursement rates and made enrollment more onerous.

“The governor believes that expanding government-sponsored insurance is not the answer,” said a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier. “Nor is requiring people to purchase it. He looks to free-market solutions.”

Any failure to cover more Texans, Ms. Frazier said, is the federal government’s for declining, under Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, to grant Mr. Perry’s requests to lift federal restrictions on Medicaid eligibility and benefits.

Rather than expanding public insurance, Mr. Perry sought to improve access by revamping the medical liability system. In 2003, he backed a successful measure that limited noneconomic damages against physicians and hospitals to a total of $750,000.

Mr. Perry boasted in New Hampshire last month that the law resulted in “21,000 more physicians practicing medicine in Texas,” attracting specialists to underserved counties.

But three law professors — Bernard Black of Northwestern University, David A. Hyman of the University of Illinois and Charles Silver of the University of Texas — find deep flaws in Mr. Perry’s calculations and conclude that the supply of practicing doctors actually increased at a slower rate after the 2003 changes than before.

In working papers, the researchers assert that tort reform significantly reduced the number and cost of liability claims. But they found no evidence that it slowed the growth of health care costs.

Mr. Perry has railed against the 2010 federal health law as “socialism on American soil” and strongly backs litigation challenging its requirement that most Americans, starting in 2014, obtain insurance.

But his state agencies have accepted nearly $20 million in grants authorized by the act, including $1 million to plan for the new insurance marketplaces known as exchanges. Nonetheless, Mr. Perry this year persuaded the Legislature to shelve a Republican bill to begin the planning process.

“He thought it would hurt our legal challenge to the law,” said State Representative John Zerwas, the measure’s sponsor. “And whether we like it or not, health insurance exchange has become synonymous with Obamacare, and there are political consequences to that.”

Mr. Perry continues to pay a political price for one decision he made to impose a health care mandate — an executive order in 2007 that made Texas the first state to require young girls to be vaccinated against cervical cancer with Gardasil. The order infuriated conservatives, and the Legislature quickly passed a bill to overturn it, which Mr. Perry allowed to take effect without his signature.

The governor, whose former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Merck, the maker of Gardasil, defended his “pro-life decision” in a debate last year. But after announcing his bid for president last month, he began describing it as a mistake.

One day before Mr. Romney signed his landmark 2006 health care bill amid pomp at Faneuil Hall, he declared victory in a column in The Boston Globe: “Every uninsured citizen in Massachusetts will soon have affordable health insurance and the costs of health care will be reduced.”

Mr. Romney is batting .500.

For the 10 percent of residents who had been uninsured, the commonwealth’s coverage mandate, coupled with government subsidies for the poor, has proved a striking success. A study last year concluded that 98.1 percent of residents, and 99.8 percent of children, had health insurance, leading the country. The state also found, to the surprise of some, that the share of employers contributing to their workers’ coverage (rather than accepting a modest penalty for not doing so) had risen.

But the law was not intended to make a serious assault on the state’s above-average health costs. A recent state report concluded that growth in private insurance premiums since 2006 had outpaced the increase in national heath care spending.

In pushing for the law, which features an exchange and requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, Mr. Romney championed an insurance mandate as the “ultimate conservative idea.” The targets of his “personal responsibility principle” were the free-riders who gambled by not buying policies and then relied on taxpayers, hospitals and the privately insured to cover the cost of their uncompensated care.

Mr. Romney could not have known then that his legacy would become such a bludgeon, with Mr. Perry, Mr. Huntsman and, impishly, Mr. Obama crediting him for the blueprint of the federal overhaul.

Tax increases have been needed to keep the Massachusetts plan afloat. But they have not been back-breaking, largely because the federal government underwrites much of the subsidized coverage. Mr. Romney is quick to remind voters that the Democratic-led Legislature overrode his veto of the requirement that employers contribute to their workers’ coverage and of benefits he considered gold-plated.

As a national candidate, Mr. Romney has argued that the law was appropriate for Massachusetts but is constitutionally prohibited as a federal solution. He does not, however, disown it.

“I’m not going to back away from the fact that I signed that bill,” Mr. Romney said recently in New Hampshire.

In Utah, Mr. Huntsman was clearly intrigued by what Mr. Romney had achieved, and in 2007, his third year in office, he set a goal of cutting the number of uninsured in half by 2010. With about 17 percent of residents uninsured, the governor viewed expanded coverage as a way to lower costs for employers and stoke his state’s competitiveness.

He had already lifted a spending cap on the state’s Children’s Health Insurance Program, which allowed unlimited enrollment and contributed to declines in the number of young uninsured.

In 2007, he hired John T. Nielsen, a former hospital system lawyer, to investigate whether “we could replicate what Massachusetts had done,” Mr. Nielsen said. He also lent his aides to a high-powered working group convened by the United Way of Salt Lake that ultimately devised a plan that relied on an exchange and an individual mandate.

In at least two interviews that year, Mr. Huntsman described a mandate as necessary to achieving the kind of expansion he envisioned. “I think if you’re going to get it done and get it done right, mandate has to be part of it in some way, shape or form,” Mr. Huntsman told the public television station KUED.

But the governor’s top health advisers, including Mr. Nielsen and Dr. David N. Sundwall, his health commissioner, said Mr. Huntsman never expressed a preference for the mandate in their discussions. And once Greg Curtis, the House speaker at the time, informed Huntsman aides that the mandate would be a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled Legislature, Mr. Huntsman did not push back.

“He’s a pragmatic politician,” Mr. Sundwall said. “He said, ‘Then let’s go with what we can get.’ ”

The resulting package, enacted in 2008, featured a scaled-down exchange, available only to small businesses. It has attracted 165 employers covering 4,206 workers and dependents, one-fiftieth the number in the Massachusetts exchange.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Huntsman gives little sense that he was ever open to an insurance mandate. Asked on CNN last month how he differed from Mr. Romney, he answered: “How about a free-market approach to health care reform instead of a heavy handed Obama-like mandate?”"

But what about their own records as governors addressing their residents’ health needs?

During his 11 years as governor of Texas, Mr. Perry has shown a shocking lack of concern for low- and moderate-income Texans who can’t afford health insurance or who have to struggle to keep it. His bromides about less government, more free-market and more self-reliance have neither held down costs nor made Texans healthier. Despite that record, he seems determined to carry that approach into the White House if elected.

Mr. Romney, in his four years as Massachusetts governor, played a major role in formulating sweeping health care reform that has shown remarkable success in expanding coverage at tolerable cost. After running away from that record in his 2008 campaign for the nomination, he has now embraced it as right for Massachusetts — but not for the nation. Voters will have to decide whether his hypocrisy would follow him into the White House and really lead him to undo the national reforms.

The differing results for residents of Massachusetts and Texas are clear. A scorecard compiled by the Commonwealth Fund in 2009 showed that Massachusetts ranked first among 50 states and the District of Columbia in the percentage of children and the percentage of adults below Medicare age who had health insurance. Texas was last in both categories. Based on 38 indicators covering such factors as access to treatment and quality of care, Massachusetts ranked seventh over all and Texas 46th.

No matter how hard Mr. Romney tries to distance himself from “Obamacare,” the Massachusetts reforms were a template for the national reform legislation. The state achieved near-universal coverage by requiring most people to obtain insurance or pay a penalty and by providing subsidies to help low- and moderate-income people buy private insurance on new exchanges.

The reforms are popular among Massachusetts residents, business leaders and doctors. They drove up costs to the state budget only modestly and in accord with projections. The primary thing Massachusetts didn’t do was control the rising costs of delivering health care, a problem it is only beginning to address."

It did not include Social Security numbers, birth dates, credit-card numbers or other information used to perpetrate identity theft, he said, but the hospital is offering free identity protection services to affected patients.

The breach was discovered by a patient and reported to the hospital on Aug. 22, according to a letter written four days later to affected patients by Diane Meyer, Stanford Hospital’s chief privacy officer. The hospital took “aggressive steps,” and the Web site removed the post the next day, Ms. Meyer wrote. It also notified state and federal agencies, Mr. Migdol said.

“It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public,” he said. “It is our intent 100 percent of the time to keep this information confidential and private, and we work hard every day to ensure that.”

Diane Dobson, of Santa Clara, Calif., said her “jaw dropped” on Saturday when she intercepted the letter from Ms. Meyer addressed to her 21-year-old son, who she said had received emergency psychiatric treatment at Stanford in 2009. Ms. Dobson said it could have been disastrous if her son, who lives at home, had learned that his name was linked to a mental health diagnosis.

“My son, I can tell you, is fragile and confused enough that this would have sent him over the edge,” Ms. Dobson said, saying she decided to speak publicly now because of her frustration with the breach. “Everyone with an electronic medical record is at risk, and that means everyone.”

Records compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services reveal that personal medical data for more than 11 million people have been improperly exposed during the past two years alone.

Since passage of the federal stimulus package, which includes provisions requiring prompt public reporting of breaches, the government has received notice of 306 cases from September 2009 to June 2011 that affected at least 500 people apiece. A recent report to Congress tallied 30,000 smaller breaches from September 2009 to December 2010, affecting more than 72,000 people.

The major breaches — a disconcerting log of stolen laptops, hacked networks, unencrypted records, misdirected mailings, missing files and wayward e-mails — took place in 44 states.

One occurred at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford in January 2010, when a desktop computer holding the medical records of 532 patients was stolen from the heart center by an employee. Hospital officials said at the time that no patient information was compromised.

But the California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $250,000, the maximum allowed, for failing to report the breach within five days of discovery, as is required under state law. The hospital appealed the fine, and a settlement has been reached but not yet disclosed, a department spokesman said.

The Stanford episode reinforces the fear that even the most prestigious medical centers are not immune to risk.

Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which trains Harvard medical students, agreed this year to pay a $1 million federal fine after an employee left paper medical records on a subway while commuting to work. The pages included the names of 192 patients, and diagnoses for about a third of them, including diagnoses for H.I.V./AIDS. They were never recovered.

The Department of Health and Human Services viewed the breach as a potential violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the 1996 law that requires protection of medical records.

Mr. Migdol, the hospital spokesman, said Stanford had concluded that “there is no employee from Stanford Hospital who has done anything impermissible.” He said he expected the federal Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own investigation. Susan McAndrew, a deputy director in the department’s Office for Civil Rights, said she could not discuss whether an investigation was in progress.

The vendor, identified by Mr. Migdol as Multi-Specialty Collection Services L.L.C., based in Los Angeles, is described on its Web site as a subsidiary of Texican Inc. Joe Anthony Reyna, who is listed in state and commercial records as Texican’s principal, did not respond to messages left at his office and home.

Mr. Migdol said the company created the spreadsheet as part of a billing-and-payment analysis for the hospital. He said the hospital immediately suspended its relationship with the contractor and received written certification that previous files would be destroyed or returned securely.

Tina Warner, a vice president at Chegg, an online company that bought Student of Fortune in August, said the site’s principals were unaware the data had been posted until informed by the hospital. They then “took it down within 30 seconds,” she said. Ms. Warner said the identity of the person who posted the Stanford data could not be determined from the user name.

Bryan Cline, a vice president with the Health Information Trust Alliance, a nonprofit company that establishes privacy guidelines for health providers, said nearly 20 percent of breaches involved outside contractors, accounting for more than half of all the records exposed.

Dr. Cline said health care providers depend unjustifiably on legal contracts with vendors to protect medical records. “That just doesn’t work, as we can see,” he said. “You have to do due diligence, something to assure yourself that the people you’re giving your data to can be trusted.”"

Registration — by providing basic information like a name, address and email address — is the first step toward filing a claim for financial damages. The fund was reopened by the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, which put $2.8 billion in the fund to compensate people with health problems related to the terrorist attacks.

The next and perhaps trickiest step will be for people who register to prove that they were actually present in the attack areas during the period covered by the fund — Sept. 11, 2001, to May 30, 2002 — and that they suffered physical harm as a direct result of the attacks and the plane crashes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pa. Psychological harm is not covered by the fund, though people with mental health troubles related to the attacks can seek treatment at government expense if their insurance does not cover it.

Officials have said that few good records were kept of those who worked at ground zero or passed through. Many of them were private contractors or volunteers who spontaneously found their way there.

It may also be a challenge for people who lived near ground zero to dig up records of their presence there as long as a decade ago.

Sheila Birnbaum, the special master for the fund, said Monday that the acceptable proof would include rent and other housing records, a badge that was used to gain admittance to the rescue and recovery area, employment records or, in the absence of any other documentation, affidavits from witnesses.

“There is a list of documents that people are going to need that are listed on the Web site, so people can start putting materials together that they’re going to need in order to attach to their applications,” Ms. Birnbaum said.

The registration, which can be done online at the fund’s newly created Web site or on paper, will give officials some idea of who might be seeking compensation, and will set up a channel of communication between the fund and those people, Ms. Birnbaum said.

Those eligible are “any individual (or a personal representative of a deceased individual) who suffered physical harm or was killed as a result of the terrorist-related aircraft crashes of Sept. 11, 2001, or the debris removal efforts that took place in the immediate aftermath of those crashes,” according to the fund’s Web site.

The “exposure zone” for residents and others in Lower Manhattan is south of Canal Street from the Hudson River to the intersection of Canal Street and East Broadway, north on East Broadway to Clinton Street and east on Clinton Street to the East River, but the special master reserves the right to make some exceptions.

After registering, people will be asked to submit their proof of eligibility beginning in November, Ms. Birnbaum said. If they are found to be eligible, they will invited to complete a compensation form, which will be used to determine how much they are owed in damages. The compensation form is still being created and tested, she said.

People who are now suffering from an illness that they attribute to the terrorist attacks have until Oct. 3, 2012, to file a claim. Others have two years from the date on which they know “or should have known of the condition for which they seek compensation,” according to the Web site. The fund will stop accepting claims in 2016.

Ms. Birnbaum said that she was trying to make the process easy enough to be followed without the help of a lawyer. But she said that for those who felt more comfortable using a lawyer, she was trying to recruit lawyers from the New York City bar association and elsewhere to serve without charge. Otherwise, the lawyer’s fee is limited to 10 percent of the award.

In approving the fund, Congress authorized a long list of breathing, digestive, muscle and skeletal disorders to be covered. But although many first responders believe they got cancer as a result of their exposure to toxic substances in the debris at ground zero, the government is still studying whether to include cancers among the illnesses that will be covered.

This is a second iteration of a fund that originally operated from 2001 to 2004, which covered people who died or were injured during the attacks. The new fund vastly expands the pool of eligible victims by recognizing that some people got sick — and may continue to get sick — long after the attacks were over.

People who applied to the original fund are eligible for this one in some circumstances, such as if they suffered a new injury, or their condition got worse than anticipated or their condition was not covered by the original fund."

“Many doctors warn patients that they have to be careful of health information on the Web,” Mr. Schorr wrote in his book. “That is true. But patient-to-patient connections online have helped me, and they can help you, too. So can online connections with medical experts and medical information. You just need a helping hand from a savvy guide to help you navigate the Web.”

It is just such a no-nonsense guide that he and Ms. Thomas have provided. In it, they discuss the kinds of useful information that can be gleaned online, at no cost, by anyone with a serious medical condition, and they describe the hallmarks of bogus advice and commercially sponsored information that may or may not be helpful.

After his diagnosis, for example, Mr. Schorr began by going to the Web site www.ACOR.org (for the Association of Cancer Online Resources), where he found a community of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a blood cancer that can remain quiescent for years, then suddenly progress.

“First, I lurked. I watched the players,” Mr. Schorr said in an interview. “Then I began asking questions about treatment and looked for responses. Several people gave the same responses, suggesting that I contact Dr. Keating.” Mr. Schorr learned that the doctor is one of the world’s leading experts in his disease.

Online Patient Communities

In their book, the authors warned that in searching for reliable information, Web users have to be discerning and think like consumers, not patients, to avoid scams and commercially motivated advice. “The Internet’s greatest strength is also its greatest flaw: Anybody can post just about anything on the Web,” they wrote.

“You need to screen out ‘I did this and you should too’ kinds of advice,” Mr. Schorr said. “Medicine is changing too fast. The Internet can help you know which way the wind is blowing: what’s new, who are the experts, where to go.”

The authors also warned against claims that someone has lifesaving information that the medical establishment “doesn’t want you to know about.”

A good place to start would be patient advocacy groups affiliated with national nonprofit health associations, like the American Heart Association or the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Online patient communities exist for virtually every major illness and quite a few that are relatively obscure. For people concerned about privacy, real names do not have to be used when posting messages.

In addition to finding the best available therapy, online patient communities can help people with problems associated with various health conditions and their treatments — for example, “chemo brain,” the mental fogginess and memory problems that can result from chemotherapy.

“The doctors don’t talk about this, but people with it do,” Mr. Schorr said, and those people can help others understand what’s happening and how best to cope with the problem.

“What you get online can help you can frame issues that you want to talk to your doctor about,” he said.

Establish an Electronic Record

When dealing with a serious or chronic illness, it can be very challenging to keep track of every test, treatment, dosage and complication, as well as the contact information for every health professional concerned with your care. One of the most valuable pieces of advice in Mr. Schorr’s book is to establish an electronic personal health record.

Among its advantages: having a permanent record of everything that was done to date and its consequences; giving different doctors instant access to vital information about your condition; avoiding needless repetition of costly, hazardous or inconvenient tests; maintaining contact information for all members of your health care team; and having a centralized source of everything important about your health.

The information recorded can include lab test results and diagnostic images; a list of emergency contacts; your health insurance information; a medication log of drug names, dosages, dispensing pharmacies and dates, and your immunization records; links to useful online patient communities and reliable medical information; personal entries about your reactions to tests and treatments; copies of your living will; and contact information for your chosen health care agents.

Nor do you have to be sick to establish such a record. Christy Schulz, 43, a wife and the mother of two school-age children in Hudson, Wis., was struggling to keep track of the family’s medical records through three major moves in 10 years. Through a record-keeping system offered online by the Mayo Clinic (powered by Microsoft HealthVault), Ms. Schulz was able to store all the relevant health information for each member of her family.

“It’s all about peace of mind, knowing there’s only one place I have to go and I can get at it from any computer,” Ms. Schulz told the authors. The information proved especially useful when her daughter Avery’s early-in-life struggle with asthma recurred some time later. Ms. Schulz decided to show Avery, 13, how to log on to the site and take an active role in her own health."

When the breach was first reported by The New York Times on Sept. 8, it was not clear how the data had made it to the Web.

Breaches of private medical data have become distressingly commonplace, with two substantial ones disclosed in the last week alone.

In Orlando, officials with Florida Hospital reported that three employees had improperly combed through emergency department records of 2,252 patients, apparently to forward information about accident victims to lawyers. The employees were fired, and law enforcement officials are investigating.

Meanwhile, Science Applications International Corporation disclosed that computer backup tapes containing medical data for 4.9 million military patients had been stolen from an employee’s car in San Antonio. The data included Social Security numbers, clinical notes, laboratory test results and prescriptions. The company said the risk of harm was low because retrieving data from the tapes would require specialized knowledge, software and hardware.

The Texas breach is by far the largest since September 2009, when a new federal law began requiring disclosures of medical privacy violations involving at least 500 people. Some 330 such episodes have been tallied, including four others that affected more than one million people each.

Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the new reporting requirements had exposed deep vulnerabilities and encouraged renewed vigilance.

“We’re moving in the right direction in terms of a culture of compliance,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates medical privacy cases. “Are there still a lot of problems out there? Yeah, my sense is there are still a lot of problems.”

The Stanford breach was notable for the duration of public exposure, and for spotlighting the vulnerability created by a medical provider’s business relationships with outside parties.

Last week, lawyers filed suit in state court in Los Angeles, seeking certification as a class action and $20 million in damages from Stanford Hospital & Clinics and Multi-Specialty Collection Services, which is known as MSCS. The threat of liability set off a predictable round of finger-pointing.

In written responses to questions, Lisa Lapin, Stanford University’s assistant vice president for university communications, said, “MSCS bears the complete and sole responsibility for the breach.”

Ms. Lapin said the hospital had sent the data in encrypted form to Mr. Corcino, who requested it on behalf of MSCS to analyze a strategy for improving billing collections. She said Mr. Corcino had regularly represented himself as MSCS’s executive vice president and had been Stanford’s “primary contact” during a seven-year relationship. MSCS, a five-person firm that audits hospital accounts to maximize reimbursement, possessed the passwords to unencrypt the data, she said.

“This mishandling of private patient information was in complete contravention of the law and of the requirements of MSCS’s contract and is shockingly irresponsible,” the hospital said in a statement.

Ms. Sternfield, Mr. Reyna’s lawyer, said Mr. Corcino had never been an MSCS employee, but rather was paid a monthly fee to drum up business, typically in face-to-face meetings with health care executives. Mr. Reyna, she said, had no knowledge that the Stanford data had been sent to Mr. Corcino, or that he had passed it on.

Mr. Corcino was not authorized to use an MSCS title, Ms. Sternfield said, but she declined to say whether Mr. Reyna was aware of the practice. She acknowledged that Mr. Corcino sometimes used an MSCS e-mail account.

In his e-mail to the breach victim, who shared it with The Times, Mr. Reyna wrote that Stanford had sent the file to Mr. Corcino “for a potential MSCS project that would audit paid accounts to verify that the reimbursement was correct.”

For his part, Mr. Corcino said in a statement that he was an independent contractor but was “the marketing face of the company,” and that MSCS “allowed me to use the title of executive vice president.” He wrote: “Stanford sent the file to me at MSCS, and I imported the data into a spreadsheet that was forwarded to the job applicant as part of a skills test. I did not intend to provide any personal health information in the file. This was a marketing project.”

Without explaining how or why he sent the data to the applicant, Mr. Corcino said MSCS had not trained him properly and faulted Stanford for sending him private information that he did not need. That, he said, was the “first link in a chain of mistakes.”

“I regret that Stanford released a file containing unnecessary information,” Mr. Corcino said, “that MSCS did not have an appropriate training and audit system for the handling of electronic data and that I was not more careful with the file. While Stanford and MSCS left the information in the file I received, it was my mistake to not catch its inclusion and remove the data.”

The hospital has terminated its relationship with MSCS, and Mr. Reyna has done the same with Mr. Corcino.

Stanford Hospital has reassured affected patients that the posted spreadsheet did not contain Social Security numbers, birthdates or credit card numbers, and has offered free identity theft protection services. The hospital said it had not uncovered any misuse of the exposed data."

But lawmakers have few dollars to toss around. The state faces $3 billion in unpaid bills and an $80 billion underfinanced pension system. In addition, lawmakers are looking toward the 2012 election cycle and a promise to roll back the state’s 5 percent personal income tax to 3.75 percent during the next three years.

“In the last 18 months, we have had very few choices,” said Representative Sara Feigenholtz, Democrat of Chicago, chairwoman of the House budget committee that in May cut financing to social service programs by about 17 percent. “The promise we made to the public is that the income tax would phase out, or part of it, in four years. So we have to approach this budget situation from many different angles. Prevention programs become a fatality. We’re in crisis mode.”

House and Senate lawmakers on budget committees are expected to deal with minor budget changes during the veto session, but even left-leaning Democrats who support spending on social services are not rallying to reverse the closings Mr. Quinn announced of three mental health institutions, two centers for the developmentally disabled and two correctional centers.

The cuts in mental health programs for children have made it difficult for the state to carry out the Illinois Children’s Mental Health Act of 2003. The act required Illinois to create a better network of services for children who show signs of mental health problems, but the cuts are bringing to a halt any progress made since then.

“There are parts of the state that have no child or adolescent psychiatrists,” said Barbara Shaw, director of the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority, who has worked to carry out the 2003 law. “Kids who are seriously emotionally disturbed, it’s estimated only half of those children are really getting the services that they need.”

The uncertainty worries Ms. Humbert, whose son receives services from an adoption program that is not threatened at the moment, but whose daughter gets state-financed help from a care worker trained to address Emme’s attention deficit hyperactivity and bipolar disorders.

“It’s a godsend,” Ms. Humbert said. “She has someone who takes her into the community, besides us, and teaches her how to act appropriately, how to go to a restaurant and not wander over to someone else’s booth and pick food off their plate or crawl under the table. It’s a huge help.”"

Wristbands would measure your levels of arousal, attention and anxiety. Bandages would monitor cuts for infection. Your bathroom mirror would calculate your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen level.

Then you’d get automated advice. Software that could analyze and visually represent this data would enable you to truly understand the impact of your behavior on your health and suggest changes to help prevent illness — by far the most effective way to cut health care costs.

Many situations would still call for professional medical attention, of course, but in most cases you wouldn’t need to make a costly trip to the doctor’s office. If you were not feeling well, a lifelike avatar on your smart phone would use natural-language processing to listen as you described your symptoms and then would translate them into medical jargon. After consulting a diagnostic supercomputer, the avatar would ask you to run a few quick medical tests at home.

You might slip a low-cost plastic attachment over your phone display, look into its eyepiece and conduct a cataract exam. The avatar would transmit the results to your human doctor, who would send you a video message explaining the diagnosis and prescribing treatment.

When you did need an office visit, you and your doctor would sit side by side in front of a large touch screen that would display a conceptual animation of what was going on inside your body. Decisions like choice of medication and dosing schedules would be made collaboratively with your doctor, and treatment regimens would be synchronized to apps on your phone that would make the task of following doctor’s orders — all too often neglected — easy and even fun. (I am an adviser to some early stage start-ups developing technologies like these.)

The United States should commit to a “moon shot” for consumer health to make this imagined world a reality. In addition to the health benefits, we would gain revenue from exports of consumer health products to countries like China and India, which are likely to become enormous health care markets. And the savings in health care costs could easily amount to a trillion dollars annually, as those costs are now about 18 percent of gross domestic product but could be brought closer in line with the 10 percent typical of modern developed nations.

I acknowledge that this goal is very optimistic, given the paternalism of the medical profession, the poor health habits of most Americans and the perverse incentives of our health care system.

But the burgeoning consumer health revolution has a powerful force on its side — American creativity. There is a rapidly growing network of inventors, academics and entrepreneurs who share a passion for empowering individuals to take control of their health. There is even a spirited health data movement, known as the Quantified Self, that is reminiscent of the Homebrew Computer Club, whose members helped spawn Apple and other companies in the early days of the personal computing revolution.

There’s also private sector money beginning to flow. Venture capitalists are ramping up their investments in health-tech start-ups. The X Prize Foundation is co-sponsoring a $10 million award for the best mobile device allowing consumers to diagnose their own diseases.

For its part, all the government has to do is to catalyze this revolution. One step in the right direction is Healthdata.gov, a free resource of public health data and tools that can help innovators quickly bring to market data-driven applications and services. A bigger step would be for Congress to pass a bill that would orchestrate the development of interoperability and privacy standards for consumer health products and actively promote the industry at home and abroad.

Recent history has shown that when the right cultural, technical and economic forces converge, people can transform fundamental aspects of society from the bottom up in a way that seemed impossible just a short time before. I believe that such a time is coming for health care."
120,445,2011-12-15T00:00:00Z,article,"As Doctors Use More Devices, Potential for Distraction Grows",54043baf38f0d80e250f4a6b,"subject:Doctors, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Text Messaging, subject:Medical Schools, subject:Malpractice, subject:Smartphones, subject:Medicine and Health",National,0.0,None,"Some hospitals have begun limiting the use of computers, smartphones and other devices in critical settings.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/health/as-doctors-use-more-devices-potential-for-distraction-grows.html,1149,"Some hospitals have begun limiting the use of computers, smartphones and other devices in critical settings.","“My gut feeling is lives are in danger,” said Dr. Papadakos, who recently published an article on “electronic distraction” in Anesthesiology News, a journal. “We’re not educating people about the problem, and it’s getting worse.”

Research on the subject is beginning to emerge. A peer-reviewed survey of 439 medical technicians published this year in Perfusion, a journal about cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery, found that 55 percent of technicians who monitor bypass machines acknowledged to researchers that they had talked on cellphones during heart surgery. Half said they had texted while in surgery.

About 40 percent said they believed talking on the phone during surgery to be “always an unsafe practice.” About half said the same about texting. The study’s authors concluded, “Such distractions have the potential to be disastrous.”

Doctors and medical professionals have always faced interruptions from beepers and phones, and multitasking is simply a fact of life for many medical jobs. What has changed, doctors say, especially younger ones, is that they face increasing pressure to interact with their devices.

The pressure stems from a mantra of modern medicine that patient care must be “data driven,” and informed by the latest, instantly accessible information. Annual investment in gadgets and other technology by hospitals and doctors has soared into the billions of dollars.

By many accounts, the technology has helped reduce medical error by, for example, providing instant access to patient data or prescription details.

Dr. Peter W. Carmel, president of the American Medical Association, a physicians group, said technology “offers great potential in health care,” but he added that doctors’ first priority should be with the patient.

Indeed, doctors and nurses face growing pressures to listen carefully to patients, provide customer service and show empathy as they look for subtle cues that might explain an illness.

“The computer has become a good place to get a result, communicate with other people,” said Abraham Verghese, a doctor and professor at the Stanford University Medical Center and a best-selling medical writer. “In the interest of preventing medical error, it’s a good friend.”

At the same time, he said, the wealth of data on the screen — what he frequently refers to as the “iPatient” — gets all the attention.

“The iPatient is getting wonderful care across America,” Dr. Verghese said. “The real patient wonders, ‘Where is everybody?’ ”

It is hard to know the precise impact that distracted doctoring has on patient care, because it is hard to measure. But at least one example puts the risks in sharp relief.

Scott J. Eldredge, a medical malpractice lawyer in Denver, recently represented a patient who was left partly paralyzed after surgery. The neurosurgeon was distracted during the operation, using a wireless headset to talk on his cellphone, Mr. Eldredge said.

“He was making personal calls,” Mr. Eldredge said, at least 10 of them to family and business associates, according to phone records. His client’s case was settled before a lawsuit was filed so there are no court records, like the name of the patient, doctor or hospital involved. Mr. Eldredge, citing the agreement, declined to provide further details.

Others describe multitasking as relatively commonplace.

“I’ve seen texting among people I’m supervising in the O.R.,” said Dr. Stephen Luczycki, an anesthesiologist and medical director in one of the surgical intensive care units at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He said he had also seen young anesthesiologists using the operating room computer during surgery.

“It is not, unfortunately, uncommon to see them doing any number of things with that computer beyond patient care,” Dr. Luczycki said, including checking e-mail and studying or entering logs on a separate case. He said that when he was in training, he was admonished to not even study a textbook in surgery, so he could focus on the rhythm and subtleties of the procedures.

When he uses computers in the intensive care unit, he regularly sees what his colleagues were doing before him.

“Amazon, Gmail, I’ve seen all sorts of shopping, I’ve seen eBay,” he said. “You name it, I’ve seen it.”

Dr. Luczycki is also a huge fan of technology’s positive impact on medicine. So, too, is Dio Sumagaysay, administrative director of 24 operating rooms at Oregon Health and Science University hospitals, even though he has heard about or witnessed instances of people using devices during critical moments.

In early 2010, he heard several complaints that doctors or nurses were using their phones to check or send e-mails even though they were part of a team intubating a patient before surgery.

Mr. Sumagaysay established a policy to make operating rooms “quiet zones,” banning any activity that was not focused on patient care. He later had to reprimand a nurse he saw checking airline prices using an operating room computer during a spinal operation.

Medical professionals say young doctors can be particularly susceptible to distraction because they have grown up being constantly connected.

At Stanford Medical School, for example, all students now get iPads, which they use to read medical texts and carry with them in hospitals but are also admonished not let get in the way of their work.

“Devices have a great capacity to reduce risk,” Dr. Charles G. Prober, senior associate dean for medical education at the school, said. “But the last thing we want to see, and what is happening in some cases now, is the computer coming between the patient and his doctor.”"
121,443,2011-12-19T00:00:00Z,article,Digital Data on Patients Raises Risk of Breaches,54045ad838f0d80e250f4c1a,"subject:Computer Security, subject:Electronic Health Records, subject:Identity Fraud, subject:American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009), organizations:Massachusetts General Hospital, subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Doctors, subject:Hospitals",Business,0.0,None,"As more doctors and hospitals have digitized patient records, the number of reported breaches has increased 32 percent this year from last year at a cost of $6.5 billion to the industry.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/technology/as-patient-records-are-digitized-data-breaches-are-on-the-rise.html,868,"As more doctors and hospitals have digitized patient records, the number of reported breaches has increased 32 percent this year from last year at a cost of $6.5 billion to the industry.","In a blog post, Mr. Tripathi describes the days after the theft as a “vortex.” Fresh in his mind was a similar, albeit smaller, breach at Massachusetts General Hospital just months earlier in which a hospital employee left detailed clinical records for 192 patients on a subway. The breach had cost the hospital $1 million in settlement fees.

“We’re a nonprofit with 35 people on staff,” says Mr. Tripathi. “A million-dollar fine would have decimated us.”

Mr. Tripathi says his nonprofit had just enacted a policy requiring that all patient files be encrypted, but had yet to decide on an encryption provider. All that stood between a determined computer thief and his patient data was a few passwords.

Mr. Tripathi went to work assembling a crisis team of lawyers and customers and a chief security officer. They hired a private investigator to scour local pawnshops and Craigslist for the stolen laptop. The biggest headache, he says, was deciphering how much about the breach his nonprofit needed to disclose.

Health organizations are required by federal law to report data breaches that affect more than 500 people to the Department of Health and Human Services. The department’s Office of Civil Rights publishes the equivalent of a data breach “Wall of Shame” on its Web site — which today includes 380 breaches affecting more than 18 million people.

Mr. Tripathi said he quickly discovered just how many ways there were to count to 500. The law requires disclosure only in cases that “pose a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individual affected.” His team spent hours poring over a backup of the stolen laptop files. Of the nearly 14,000 patient records on the stolen laptop, most records did not warrant disclosure. In 2,777 cases, for instance, a record listed only a patient’s name.

Complicating matters were liability rules. In the eyes of the law, Mr. Tripathi’s nonprofit is a contractor that acts on behalf of health providers. The legal burden of protecting patient data actually falls on his clients: the physicians and hospitals who entrusted his nonprofit with their files.

“The laws create a perverse outcome,” he says. “It was our fault, but from a federal perspective, it wasn’t our breach.”

Mr. Tripathi narrowed down the group of patients whose data put them at serious risk for identity theft to 998 people across seven physician practices. Only one practice broke the 500-patient threshold requiring disclosure on the Department of Health and Human Services Web site.

His office got to work notifying the affected patients of the data breach. They offered free credit monitoring — though less than 10 percent took them up on the option — spending a total of $6,000.

In the aftermath, Mr. Tripathi says his company destroyed all patient data on mobile devices and temporarily prohibited employees from removing patient data from clients’ offices. The company now mandates that all data be encrypted, and employees are required to tell health providers what data they will need to access and how they plan to use it.

He never found the stolen laptop, and the incident, all told, cost his nonprofit $288,000.

In many ways, Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative got off easy. In October, a desktop computer containing unencrypted records on more than four million patients was stolen from Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system based in Sacramento. A rock was thrown through a window to gain access to the computer. The theft is now the subject of two class-action suits, each of which seeks $1,000 for each patient record breached.

“Breaches are going to be one of the big challenges as more physicians and hospitals adopt electronic health records,” Mr. Tripathi says. “We’re entering a brave new world.”"

Staying Alive The struggles of a business trying to survive.

First, thanks to everyone who encouraged me to keep writing (see my last post). The encouragement was, well, encouraging. I’ll do my best to keep it real, with numbers when appropriate.

Which brings me to this week’s post, a response to the comments on my post about my health insurance rates (executive summary: they went down, perhaps because of the departure of an older, sicker worker). The comments fell into several groups. Some people wanted to know more about whether I discriminate in hiring and how I manage information about my employees’ health status. There were a lot of comments about how insurance companies set rates, and as usual, they were contradictory. And there were pleas for me to weigh in on the policy debate regarding our national health system.

Here are a few highlights, starting with questions about how I treat my workers:

From Aimee: “Kids get sick too — so what do you do exclude people with families? Or women in their 20s and 30s may get pregnant and have complications — do you exclude them? Some groups have a higher tendency towards common chronic illnesses — do you exclude them?”

I want to make this clear: I do not discriminate based on family or health status, in hiring or afterward. I hire based on ability to do the job, and the applicant pool is limited to the people who answer my ads. We’re not a big company, so our employee population does not reflect the diversity of this country. Of the 14 employees, 12 are men, with ages ranging from 24 to 50. Both of the women are over 50.

The company will buy health coverage for any employee who asks for it — and the employee decides how many loved ones are covered. The company picks up two-thirds of the cost, the employee pays the rest. Obviously, the employees’ costs vary depending on what type of coverage they choose. In 2012, every employee but one will be covered by my policies; two who used to be covered under their wives’ policies were left without insurance when their wives lost their jobs. This will increase the company’s costs by $14,848. I’m not thrilled about it, but what can I do?

From Coakl: Do you get any discounts for ensuring your workers are nonsmokers and keeping their weight in check?

Not that I know of. We have only one smoker, and the physical nature of the job tends to keep people in shape (that’s a photo of all of us above, standing in front of an almost finished table). I don’t recall being asked to provide any information about this, other than one time in 2005 when we investigated switching health insurers. Then we had to fill out a fairly detailed census form to get a rate quote (turned out, no surprise, that the rates were identical.)

I presume that insurance companies have a pretty detailed picture of everyone’s health status based on the doctor visits and prescriptions. Even if I did run programs about smoking and weight, I would have no control over my employees’ families.

From Chilling: Do your employees have any privacy in regard to their major health issues? How is it that you know who is causing your rates to go higher and lower?

They have all the privacy they want, but in a small company the reason for sick days is going to be discussed with the boss. My employees are a genial and friendly bunch, so I presume that they discuss some things with each other in the course of ordinary conversation. I don’t keep any records about health status or the reason for sick days. We don’t even have sick days per se — we give out personal days, which can be used for any reason. (We offer six in the first year of employment, with one day per additional year of service to a maximum of 16. This is in addition to six federal holidays.) I don’t actually know how our rates are set — it’s a huge mystery. In the previous post, I speculated that our rate drops were related to the departure of a heavy health care user. But I don’t know that for sure.

Which brings us to these comments about how rates are set:

From Art: The cost of your plan is determined more by the state you live in.

In New Jersey, small group plans (less than 50 fulltime employees) do not have medical underwriting. So if you had medical claims they would not affect your rates. On the other hand New Jersey takes the average age of the group and prices the plan on that. So older workers drive the price of the plan higher

This would be great if I were in New Jersey. Or maybe not. My employees stay with me for a long time, and we gain greatly from a stable, experienced, productive work force. But it’s remarkable that our system essentially puts a special tax on my company for offering people long-term employment (by charging more for older workers). If health costs keep going up, it might be cheaper at some point for me to change to younger, lower-skilled people who are replaced on a regular basis. Investing in technology would be one way for me to do this. That’s not a business model I’m eager to implement, but why does our system offer such incentives? And what if I couldn’t make a profit any other way?

From E.G. Penet: Yes, premiums are down a bit, including mine own BCBS in Michigan. However, deductibles and co-pays are going up, fast. Every good thing costs something somewhere along the line. Just wait until your employees get their bills.

It’s not clear whether you are a boss or employee, but here’s how it works for me. I get offered a variety of plans from our insurer, with different types of coverage and different co-pays. The cost of the policy to the company varies greatly with the size of the co-pay, the amount of prescription drug coverage, and whether it’s an H.M.O. or not. I choose two that I think are the best fit and that I can afford, and that’s what the employees get to choose from. I make a decision, they live with it. I’d prefer not to be involved with this decision at all, but I’m stuck with it.

From Excellency: Next time you write on the subject maybe you could explore the following possibility: You put $5,000 per year into a Health Savings Account for each of your employees insured with you and get a group account with lower premiums and a $5,000 deductible. If your employee does not use the $5,000 for health care it just accrues in his account like an I.R.A. or 401-K. If he uses it he will keep whatever portion he does not use and when he goes over $5,000 per year the insurance kicks in. Would this make sense for you as a businessman and your employees?

We were offered an option for a policy with a $6,000 yearly deductible (per family) which was somewhat less expensive than the H.M.O.: $805 a month versus $971 a month. This may or may not have been intended for us to set up an H.S.A.

Here’s why I didn’t even consider it: plans of this sort put each worker in the position of having to negotiate pricing for medical care with doctors. Those least capable of doing this will get the worst, most expensive health care. I’m an experienced negotiator, and even I don’t want to touch this.

If doctors had easily accessible price lists, it might be different. I checked my doctor’s Web site. The practice is part of the University of Pennsylvania Medical System, which I presume is a well-funded and technologically savvy organization. I searched for “pricing” in the search feature, and turned up no results. I searched “price for doctor visit” and got boilerplate about how to prepare for the first visit. There is no price information, or any indication of how to find it. How are employees supposed to negotiate pricing for an emergency room visit? If you’re filling out paperwork with a bleeding 4-year-old screaming in your arms, you’re going to sign anything put in front of you, which will subject you to whatever the hospital feels like billing you. That’s not a system I want to participate in.

And now for my opinions on current policy. I’ll keep it short. I agree with this, from MHF:

You shouldn’t have to be in the health insurance business at all. That statement has nothing to do whether I support a government backed program or not — it’s just that most business owners don’t have the knowledge/expertise to manage the health care options of a large number of people. Business owners should be running businesses not playing doctor.

Amen to that. And not only would I prefer to shed this responsibility, but think of the wave of creativity and entrepreneurship that would be unleashed if people weren’t tied to crummy jobs just to get insurance. That’s the way forward for us as an economy. Unfortunately, the existing system is too large, with too many stakeholders, for us to change. I think we’re stuck with it.

ZocDoc , an oddly named Web service for scheduling appointments with doctors, started in New York in 2007 and has been growing at a torrid pace. Last week the company added Seattle, its 14th metropolitan market in the United States.

ZocDoc says its Web site is attracting doctor-seeking browsers at the rate of 800,000 a month, a fourfold jump from a year ago. The service is free for patients; doctors pay $250 a month.

ZocDoc makes a couple of larger points — one about health care IT, and the other about Web start-ups in general.

First, at a time when so much of the attention in health IT is focused on the national campaign to adopt electronic patient records, backed by billions of dollars in federal subsidy payments, ZocDoc is a neat bottom-up success story.

Second, though the initial costs of starting a Web venture may be low, ZocDoc shows that building out a consumer Web service is costly. The company has raised $95 million.

The roster of investors is impressive. The early backers included Khosla Ventures; Marc Benioff, founder of Salesforce.com; and Bezos Expeditions, which manages the personal investments of Jeffrey Bezos, founder of Amazon. Later rounds of supporters included the Founders Fund and Ron Conway, a prominent Silicon Valley investor; and then DST Global and Goldman Sachs.

An online appointment-scheduling service seems straightforward. But the founders — Cyrus Massoumi, its chief executive, and Oliver Kharraz, both former McKinsey consultants, and Nick Ganju, the chief technology officer — see their efforts in larger terms.

“We’re one of the companies that can help fix the health care system,” said Dr. Kharraz, a physician and ZocDoc’s chief operating officer. “We’re making doctors more efficient and helping patients find the hidden supply of health care.” That hidden supply, he explained, is the 10 to 20 percent of appointments that are made and then canceled within a day or two of the appointment date.

At first, Mr. Massoumi recalled, many doctors were skeptical. Progress was initially slow, but things improved “once they saw a return on the monthly charge,” he said. Then, word-of-mouth endorsements by doctors became a powerful marketing tool.

Peer recommendations prompted Douglas Bailyn, a primary care doctor in Manhattan, to try ZocDoc in early 2010. The benefit, he explained, was evident last Thursday. Just before he came into his office, Dr. Bailyn noticed there were a couple of last-minute cancellations of afternoon appointments. By midday, he said, those openings had been filled.

“Having a medical practice is a business,” Dr. Bailyn said. “You need to fill your slots, and ZocDoc definitely increases the chances of filling slots.”

Demographics partly explain why ZocDoc has been so effective for doctors like him. The median age for his patients, he said, is in the mid-30s — a group accustomed to arranging their lives online. Some longtime patients use ZocDoc for the convenience, he said, but a typical case is “a 24-year-old with a sore throat.”

Patients are not selecting doctors blindly online. Patients are asked to rate their experience, and most do so with comments and one-to-five star ratings in three categories — overall recommendation, bedside manner and wait time. Dr. Bailyn, for example, has about 200 ZocDoc reveiws.

Investors have been impressed by the ZocDoc team and its strategy. David Weiden, a partner at Khosla Ventures, was a manager at Netscape when its co-founder James G. Clark forged off in 1996 to found Healtheon, a dot-com start-up with visions of transforming health care. It failed, Mr. Weiden said, partly because of its ambitious, ill-defined agenda.

By contrast, ZocDoc, Mr. Weiden said, was “focused and specific, and its strategy is to get a foothold in health care, gain credibility and go from there.”

Incidentally, the oddball name? Originally, the founders wanted doctors.com, but they learned that the domain name would cost more than $1 million. They got ZocDoc.com instead for $6 — and stuck with it."

German newspapers published instructions on how to request personal data files from Facebook. Within a few months, 40,000 people had made similar requests. The data protection office in Ireland, where Facebook has its European data center, conducted an audit of Facebook’s data retention practices; the company agreed to overhaul the way it collects data in Europe, including disposing of user data “much sooner.” German regulators have scrutinized facial recognition technology. The Netherlands is considering a bill that would require Internet users to consent to being tracked as they travel from Web site to Web site. And last month, the European Commission unveiled a sweeping new privacy law that would require Web companies to obtain explicit consent before using personal information, inform regulators and users in the event of a data breach and, most radical, empower a citizen of Europe to demand that his or her data be deleted forever.

“Europe has come to the conclusion that none of the companies can be trusted,” said Simon Davies, the director of the London-based nonprofit Privacy International. “The European Commission is responding to public demand. There is a growing mood of despondency about the privacy issue.”

Every European country has a privacy law, as do Canada, Australia and many Latin American countries. The United States remains a holdout: We have separate laws that protect our health records and financial information, and even one that keeps private what movies we rent. But there is no law that spells out the control and use of online data.

It would be tempting to say that history and culture on this side of the Atlantic make privacy a non-issue. That’s not exactly the case. Privacy has always mattered in American law and to American sensibilities, but in a different way.

Anxieties over privacy came up when postcards were first sent in the late 19th century. The advent of photography prompted Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, in an 1890 article in The Harvard Law Review, to warn of the dangers of displaying private family wedding pictures in the pages of every newspaper. And in one of the most important privacy decisions in recent years, the Supreme Court in January ruled that police officers violated the Constitution when they placed a Global Positioning System tracking device on a suspect’s car, to monitor its movements. “Europeans are much more sensitive about controlling their image online,” said James Q. Whitman, a Yale Law School professor who has written about the differences in jurisprudence between the United States and Europe.

Social mores around privacy vary widely across the globe. In Japan, Google was criticized for being intrusive when its self-driven cars cruised the streets with a camera snapping pictures for Google Street View.

In India, where I was a correspondent for this newspaper for more than four years, the notion of privacy seems foreign. A shopkeeper might casually ask a childless woman if she has gynecological trouble; school grades are posted on public walls; many people still live in extended families, literally wandering in and out of one another’s bedrooms. But a project to issue biometric identity cards to every Indian citizen recently set off a flurry of concern over privacy, prompting the government to draft a new law that enshrines the right to privacy for the first time.

IN the United States, federal legislation on online privacy has languished, as lawmakers weigh the interests of consumers and companies in the battle for personal information.

Part of the difficulty in regulating online privacy is the speed of technological innovation. Just as it becomes remarkably easy for us to share our information with others, it also becomes cheaper and easier to crunch and analyze that information — and store it forever, if necessary.

Stewart A. Baker, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, is among those who see enormous benefits for private companies and government agencies alike. To fight it on privacy grounds, he argued, would be largely futile. “You can’t really have a property interest in data,” he argued. “It’s going to get cheaper to reproduce it. It’s going to get reproduced and stored. It’s going to get copied.”

Privacy advocates worry about the consequences. Most people may not have much to hide. For a few, not sharing personal information may be vital. They’re the ones who need the protection of the law, argued Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of “Consent of the Networked,” a book about digital freedom.

“It may be victims of domestic abuse who don’t want to be stalked or tracked, or it could be dissidents in Syria, or someone who has weird opinions and could mistakenly end up on a watch list when they don’t deserve it,” said Ms. MacKinnon. “If you have a democratic society, the point is not to say whatever is good for the majority is all we need.”"

A breach in Utah is a case in point.","Eastern European hackers have stolen personal records for 780,000 people in the breach of a computer server in Utah.

The list of victims include recipients of Medicaid and a health care program for low-income children in Utah, officials at Utah’s Department of Health said in a statement. Hackers were able to breach the servers by exploiting a technician’s weak password. On March 30, they downloaded 24,000 files to computers in Eastern Europe. Each file contained records for hundreds of recipients.

Utah’s Department of Health has updated the number of victims three times. It initially said 24,000 people were affected but by Monday evening, the list had expanded to include 780,000. Of those, the department said 280,000 had their Social Security numbers stolen, according to the revised statement.

Some security experts said the breach pointed to a problem with the way personal records were increasingly stored in bulk.

“Why do we continue to see these large aggregate databases?” Eddie Schwartz, chief information security officer at the computer security firm RSA, said in an interview on Tuesday. “Why should hackers be able to steal 10 million credit card numbers or 700,000 personal records at once? We need to think about distributing that information so that when networks do get penetrated, we’re not looking an all-or-nothing situation.”



In this case, officials at Utah’s Department of Health said they had recently moved claim records to a new server. Despite several layers of security in place, they said hackers were able to bypass the system because a technician configured the server with a weak password. The department said it has since shut down the server, put new security measures in place and was inspecting other servers across the state.

As banks step up their security measures, health providers and retailers have become a more prevalent target for hackers, security experts note. The same day hackers infiltrated the server in Utah, for instance, reports surfaced that another group of hackers had pilfered information for over a million credit card accounts in an attack on Global Payments, an Atlanta company that processes payments for retailers. According to sources briefed on the investigation, the breach marked the second time the payment processor had been attacked in the last year.

Security experts said health and insurance records were also becoming a target for hackers because personal information, like the kind stored by Utah’s Department of Health, could fetch a higher price on the black market than a single credit card record.

“Credit cards have a much lower per-unit-value compared to identities which have a much higher per-unit-value on the black market,” Mr. Schwartz said.

Child records, in particular, are valuable to criminals because their lack of a credit report or bank account makes it difficult to monitor them for identity theft. Their identity can be exploited for years before it is uncovered. According to AllClear ID, a company that offers identity protection services, some 10 percent of children in the United States have had their identity stolen.

Utah’s Department of Health said it was cooperating with the F.B.I. on its breach and working to notify victims, with priority given to those whose Social Security numbers were stolen. The department said it would provide free credit monitoring to those victims.

It suggested that Utah’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Plan recipients, as well as anyone whose health-care provider might have submitted information to the state for Medicaid coverage within the last four months, monitor their credit and bank accounts."

The not-so-simple answer is that it depends on the medical provider and the insurance company, and what sort of deal the provider has negotiated with their insurer.","Hospital care tends to be the most confounding, and experts say the charges you see on your bill are usually completely unrelated to the cost of providing the services (at hospitals, these list prices are called the “charge master file”). “The charges have no rhyme or reason at all,” Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Why is 30 minutes in the operating room $2,000 and not $1,500? There is absolutely no basis for setting that charge. It is not based upon the cost, and it’s not based upon the market forces, other than the whim of the C.F.O. of the hospital.”

And those charges don’t really have any connection to what a hospital or medical provider will accept for payment, either. “If you line up five patients in their beds and they all have gall bladders removed and they get the same exact medication and services, if they have insurance or if they don’t have insurance, the hospital will get five different reimbursements, and none of it is based on cost,” said Holly Wallack, a medical billing advocate in Miami Beach. “The insurers negotiate a different rate, and if you are uninsured, underinsured or out of network, you are asked to pay full fare.”

With the exception of Medicare and Medicaid, experts say, the amount paid for services — or the price your insurers pay — is based on the market power of the insurance company on the one side and the hospitals and providers on the other, and the reimbursement agreements they ultimately reach. So large insurers that command a lot of market power may be able to negotiate lower rates than smaller companies with less influence. Or, insurers can place hospitals or providers on a preferred list, which may help bolster their business, in exchange for a lower reimbursement rate. On the other hand, well-regarded hospitals may command higher prices from insurers.

So let’s say you have coverage through a high-deductible plan, where you’re responsible for, say, the first $5,000 or $10,000. It’s possible that you may have to pay more out of pocket for your medical services than your friend, also in a high-deductible plan, but one with an insurer that has greater negotiating power. “The ones that are affiliated with the larger insurers do best,” Mr. Anderson said, adding that the uninsured have virtually no bargaining power, which is why they are expected to pay much more.

With so little pricing information available, expecting people to shop around for quality care at the lowest cost — something that’s not always possible in emergency situations — is also asking a lot of consumers. “I have always found a bit cruel the much-mouthed suggestion that patients should have ‘more skin in the game’ and ‘shop around for cost-effective health care’ in the health care market,” said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health policy expert and professor at Princeton University, “when patients have so little information easily available on prices and quality to those things.”

President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, the health care overhaul law passed in 2010, tries to make some improvements (though the Supreme Court is expected to rule whether all or some of the law is constitutional this month). But while the law’s changes help you shop around for insurance policies — specifically through its new HealthCare.gov Web site, a one-stop shop that lists all of your insurance options in one place — it’s still unclear how effective the law will be for anyone comparing medical services.

Still, there are a handful of provisions that will help consumers on these issues. Starting in September, health insurers and group health plans must provide consumers a comprehensive summary of their plan’s benefits and coverage in plain language. It also provides grants to help states start or improve services, known as Consumer Assistance Programs, aimed at assisting people who have questions or problems about their health coverage. These programs, like Connecticut’s Office of the Healthcare Advocate, help people understand their plans, find coverage as well as assist with billing issues. Additionally, the new law gives patients the right to appeal their insurers’ decisions after they are denied payment, for “plan or policy years” starting after July 1, 2011.

But one of the overarching ideas behind the law, according to Mike Hash, acting director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, is to eventually encourage insurance plans to provide detailed information on, say, the quality of care and how much your share of the costs will be if you choose to have your knee surgery, for instance, at one provider versus another. He also expects more clarity on out-of-pocket costs, which will be capped at reduced amounts for people who buy insurance through the state-run insurance exchanges and meet certain income requirements. But other out-of-pocket limits will apply to other people who buy plans inside and many plans outside the exchanges, experts said.

For now, there are some other helpful resources that exist, many of which can provide you with a rough idea of what some services might cost in a specific area, while some insurers offer tools to its customers as well. (I’ve listed some of them in the blog post attached to the online version of this column.)

As for the 68-year-old patient, Ms. Poole’s detective work ultimately reduced his out-of-pocket costs by more than $22,000, which left him responsible for about $3,915. Since the couple didn’t have long-term care insurance, he was also responsible for the nursing home’s charges of $65,000, which Ms. Poole said Medicare covered for only a short period of time. (Ms. Poole, a former emergency room nurse, who later received an M.B.A., generally charges about 25 percent of the savings found.)

She uncovered the savings in various places — there were charges for brand medications when the patient ordered generic, services that were double-billed, as well as charges for a private room that the patient did not request; he was only there because no other rooms were available. In another instance, a surgeon belatedly submitted his $4,400 bill to the insurance company, so the claim was denied. That wasn’t the patient’s fault, but he was billed anyway. She lobbied the billing department to drop the charges, and they did.

Then, when the $132,000 hospital bill came, the patient was told he owed $9,200 and it had to be paid in 10 days. As it turns out, only one of the insurers had paid its share, which was hard to decipher from the bill. Ultimately, the patient only owed $164.99. “There were three explanation of benefits from Blue Cross Blue Shield, each with an different amount due,” she said, ranging from about $164 to $81,900. “How’s that for confusion?”

All told, Ms. Poole spent about 96 hours dissecting each bill, line by line, comparing it with the providers’ medical records and keeping track of it all in a complex spreadsheet.

“It’s a broken system,” she said."

Data brokers like Acxiom have developed advanced techniques to collect and collate information about consumers’ offline, online and mobile behavior. But they have been slow to develop innovative ways for consumers to gain access to the information that companies obtain, share and sell about them for marketing purposes.

Now federal regulators are pressuring data brokers to operate more transparently. In a report earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission recommended that the industry set up a public Web portal that would display the names and contact information of data brokers, as well as describe consumers’ data access rights and other choices.

Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, said consumers should have access to all the details that data brokers collect on them, as well as any analyses that the companies sell about their behavior.

“I include in that not just the raw data, but also how that information has been analyzed to place the consumer into certain categories for marketing or other purposes,” she said. “I believe that giving consumers this kind of granularity will greatly increase consumer trust in the information flow process and will lead to more accurate marketing.”

At the moment, however, information brokers have wildly different policies. Acxiom lets people opt out of its marketing databases, while Epsilon, another marketing services firm, allows people to opt out of having their data rented to third parties. Epsilon says it will also furnish individuals, upon request, with general information about their past retail transactions — including the categories and years of purchase. But it does not include exact product or retailer names.

Andrew Frawley, the president of Epsilon, says his company has set up a task force to explore giving consumers greater access and choices.

“We agree in principle that more transparency is better,” he said.

But setting up a system for consumers to gain access to their own marketing data could be costly and technically challenging for data brokers, said Stuart Madnick, a professor of information technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Companies would have to develop security systems to verify a consumer’s identity and to ensure that no one else could have access to that individual’s record, he said. At the same time, they would have to be prepared to respond to people who questioned the accuracy of the records.

“How correct is the information they have and are disseminating on you?” Professor Madnick asked. “How do they know who is asking for it?”

Information security experts said data brokers might be reluctant to make public access easier lest consumers react by wanting to opt out of the data collection process altogether.

In early May, when I first looked at Acxiom’s Web site, the online request form that required consumers to submit their Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information was not encrypted. (Ms. Barrett Glasgow said the company quickly identified and fixed a broken link that had caused the problem.) After I submitted my application, I didn’t hear back from the company for several weeks. Subsequently, I left a voice mail message on Acxiom’s consumer hot line. Nobody called back.

“It sounds like this form was not a high priority for them,” said Richard M. Smith, the founder of Boston Software Forensics, a consulting firm, and an expert on Internet security. Requiring consumers to mail in a personal check as part of the verification process, he added, seemed old-fashioned and cumbersome. “It’s so last century. Why are you making it so inconvenient?”

After I reported in the article last month that Acxiom had not responded to my data request, a company representative e-mailed me to verify that I was indeed the person who had requested her file. Then Acxiom e-mailed me an encrypted report containing a list of my previous residential addresses.

Several days later, Ms. Barrett Glasgow called to explain the delay in processing: Acxiom receives, on average, fewer than 100 requests a year from consumers, she said, and my check had “ended up on someone’s desk that was on vacation.” She said she would look into why company representatives hadn’t returned my voice mail message.

“We’ll try to take some action to improve and clean up the program,” she said. “We don’t want to make it hard to do, risky to do, or leave a bad impression in the individual’s mind.”

BUT I still wanted to know the financial, retail, travel, health and hobby details that Acxiom might have collected about me. So I e-mailed Ms. Barrett Glasgow last month, asking to see at least some of my data and to find out the socioeconomic category in which Acxiom had placed me.

Ms. Barrett Glasgow was on vacation last week and could not be reached for comment.

Commissioner Brill of the F.T.C. said she could not comment on specific companies. But she said the reluctance of the data broker industry to show consumers their own records reminded her of an earlier era, when consumer reporting agencies — companies that track and sell information about people’s credit histories — protested that it would be too expensive and time-consuming for them to show individuals the same reports that creditors could see. In 1996, Congress updated the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, giving people greater access to the files that those agencies held about them. Today, consumers can easily gain access to their credit reports online.

“What the credit reporting industry did was change their point of view from client-oriented to consumer-oriented, and develop the tools and technology to allow consumers to see what’s in their reports and ensure it is accurate,” Ms. Brill said. “The data broker industry could do the exact same thing.”"

Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field.

Several years ago I wrote “Humbled in Taiwan,” a commentary for The British Medical Journal.

Today's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors. The piece was prompted by a conversation between a health services researcher and the head of health information technology of Taiwan’s Bureau of National Health Insurance, which administers Taiwan’s single-payer national health insurance system. By that time, virtually all of Taiwan’s claims were billed electronically.

In that conversation, the bureau’s head of health information technology lamented that some hospitals and physicians in Taiwan still failed to submit fully completed claims forms for encounters with patients within 24 hours of the encounter.

Twenty-four hours?



In the United States, claims settlement for medical procedures under private health insurance can take up to three months; it takes about three weeks for Medicare. As I noted in my commentary for The British Medical Journal, “private health insurance companies in the United States count themselves lucky if high-priced actuaries can tell them in the middle of the year what the carrier ultimately will have to pay the providers of health care for services rendered in the previous year.”

Since 1995, Taiwan’s 23 million people have enjoyed universal, comprehensive health insurance coverage under its single-payer national health insurance system, which is financed by a mixture of payroll contributions from employers and employees and government subsidies.

The system is administered by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, whose administrative budget absorbs less than 2 percent of the system’s total spending for health care benefits. Over all, Taiwan spends about 6.9 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, compared with close to 18 percent spent in the United States. (More detail on the genesis of the system and its modus operandi can be found in this article in Health Affairs and on the bureau’s Web site.)

About two weeks ago, I attended the Europe-Taiwan Health Dialogue, held in Taipei. That two-day conference was sponsored jointly by Taiwan’s Department of Health and the European Health Forum Gastein, whose European Health Forums are among the leading platforms for discussions on health policy and are attended by participants from around the world. (My travel to the conference, to which I was invited as an academic expert, was underwritten by the Department of Health.)

As an American, I found myself humbled again by a presentation, “Information Technology and Patient-Centered Care – the Case of Taiwan,” delivered by Dr. Min-Huei Hsu, director of the Medical Informatics Center of Taiwan’s Department of Health.

Dr. Hsu’s presentation brought to my mind a chapter on health information, which, as chairman of the New Jersey Commission on Rationalizing Health Care Resources, I wrote for the final report published in January 2008. In that chapter I sketched out the vision for a 21st-century health information system for New Jersey that had emerged from discussion among the commissioners.

Alas, more often than not, the work of such commissions amounts to howling into the wind in our latitudes. It certainly did in that case.

But, in Taiwan, I saw much of such a system in place and fully operating, and mused how long it might take New Jersey, and much of America, for that matter, to come this far.

In Taiwan, the Department of Health, the very active Bureau of Health Promotion, the Centers for Disease Control and other governmental administrative functions are linked in a network that allows a select set of professionals access to its database, under strict controls to secure privacy. Clinics, hospitals and pharmacies are also linked to this central database.

Among other things, this data system allows the guardians of public health to detect quickly the incidence of certain illness that may be infectious, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.

Now in its third year is a clinical interface among health care facilities that already includes half of Taiwan’s 500 hospitals. By 2016, all Taiwan’s hospitals and 20,000 clinics where physicians practices are to be on this electronic medical record system.

This data system allows physicians in one hospital or clinic to get access to an individual patient’s medical record, but only under strict conditions of privacy. The record includes hospital discharge summaries and medical records from outpatient visits, including prescriptions, lab tests and digital images. Such data-sharing among clinicians in different health care facilities or systems is rare in the United States. Again, roughly half of Taiwan’s 500 hospitals are already linked in this way, in the system’s third year.

To access a patient’s file requires that the physician has an authorized digital signature to do so and, more important, that the patient has swiped his or her own, personal electronic smart card through the specialized card reader on every physician’s desk, thus authorizing the access.

That card reader has slots for both the patient’s and the physician’s electronic smart card. It links patient and physician directly to the data center of the Bureau of National Health Insurance at the very time the encounter takes place. Thus it allows the bureau to track health care use virtually in real time and also to monitor the behavior of patients given to excessive doctor shopping.

Touring a rural area, we saw mobile clinics on wheels, equipped with imaging devices (mammography scanners, sonar scanners and X-ray machines) for general check-ups of rural populations in remote areas. In front of the mobile clinics sat young technicians with laptops, linking to the Bureau of National Health Insurance data center both patients and physicians, with the latter also having access to the patients’ medical records.

The information network also includes electronic kiosks in hospital lobbies; about half of Taiwan’s hospitals now feature such kiosks. Using a secure identification card, a patient can make an appointment with a doctor or review her own medical record, including results from tests or scans. To find more about what the test results might indicate, she could use electronic links to explanations. Finally, since all medicines are bar-coded, she might consult the kiosk about the specifics of drugs prescribed for her.

Currently in the field are pilot studies for a national tele-health project for long-term care.

I am sure that there are pockets here and there in the United States with similarly advanced health information technology. Kaiser Permanante, for example, is bound to be as advanced and perhaps even more so. The Veterans Administration is known for its electronic health information system. Some larger health systems and academic health centers may also have highly developed intra-system information systems.

But I wonder how many Americans today can walk up to a multifunction kiosk, find their own medical records, make appointments with doctors and learn there about lab tests and prescription drugs. I wonder how many American doctors today can reach their patients’ complete medical records across different health care facilities and systems.

I do not want to romanticize Taiwan health care. Like any health system, it has its share of problems, all the more so because, at only 6.7 percent of G.D.P., the system is underfunded by at least a percentage point or so, using international standards.

I also am persuaded that Taiwan needs a larger supply of doctors. Nor would even Taiwan’s health experts assert that their health information system is perfect. It remains a work in progress.

But a national health system must be judged not only by the level of health care it delivers, but by what it offers its citizens for the money they spend on it – by its cost-effectiveness, in professional jargon.

In the United States, the Business Roundtable concluded in a 2010 study that given its high level of spending on health care, the American system shows a 23 percent value gap relative to what Europeans spend and get in return, and a 46 percent value gap relative to spending in Asian countries, including Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.

At its best, the American health system probably is unrivaled in the world, staffed by highly trained and hard-working doctors and nurses. For the most part, it boasts luxurious health care facilities.

Oddly and sadly, however, the United States has yet to harvest the full benefits of modern electronic health information. Our nation’s engineers and entrepreneurs design smart hardware and software for health care, but we do not seem to use our own products as smartly as do many other countries."

Radiation, like alcohol, is a double-edged sword. It has indisputable medical advantages: Radiation can reveal hidden problems, from broken bones and lung lesions to heart defects and tumors. And it can be used to treat and sometimes cure certain cancers.

But it also has a potentially serious medical downside: the ability to damage DNA and, 10 to 20 years later, to cause cancer. CT scans alone, which deliver 100 to 500 times the radiation associated with an ordinary X-ray and now provide three-fourths of Americans’ radiation exposure, are believed to account for 1.5 percent of all cancers that occur in the United States.

Recognition of this hazard and alarm over recent increases in radiological imaging have prompted numerous experts, including some radiologists, to call for more careful consideration before ordering tests that involve radiation.

“All imaging has increased, but CTs account for the bulk of it,” said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a specialist in radiology and biomedical imaging at the University of California, San Francisco. “There’s clearly widespread overuse. More than 10 percent of patients each year are receiving very high radiation exposures.”

The trick to using medical radiation appropriately, experts say, is to balance the potential risks against known benefits. But despite the astronomical rise in recent years in the use of radiation to obtain medical images, this balancing act is too often ignored. The consequences include unnecessary medical costs and risks to the future health of patients.

Both doctors and patients have a responsibility to better understand the benefits and risks and to consider them carefully before doctors order and patients undergo a radiation-based procedure.

Patients may be surprised to learn that some of the newest uses of radiological imaging, including CT scans of coronary arteries to look for calcium buildup, have not yet been shown in scientifically designed clinical trials to lead to better outcomes than tests that do not involve radiation exposure, and thus their true benefits are at best a guess. Experts have estimated that widespread use of coronary artery scans, which deliver 50 to 150 times the radiation of a chest X-ray, could result in 42 additional cases of cancer for every 100,000 men who have the procedure, and 62 cases for every 100,000 women who do.

For every 1,000 people undergoing a cardiac CT scan, the radiation adds one extra case of cancer to the 420 that would normally occur. This risk may seem inconsequential, but not to someone who gets a cancer that could have been prevented.

Complicating the matter is the enormous variation — sometimes tenfold or more — in the amounts of radiation to which patients are exposed from the same procedure at different institutions, or even at the same institution at different times.

Although the cancer-causing effects of radiation are cumulative, no one keeps track of how much radiation patients have already been exposed to when a new imaging exam is ordered. Even when patients are asked about earlier exams, the goal is nearly always to compare new findings with old ones, not to estimate the risks of additional radiation.

As Dr. Michael S. Lauer of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine three years ago, “The issue of radiation exposure is unlikely to come up because each procedure is considered in isolation, the risks posed by each procedure are low and seemingly unmeasurable, and any radiation-induced cancer won’t appear for years and cannot easily be linked to past imaging procedures.”

After an extensive review of the environmental causes and risk factors for breast cancer, the Institute of Medicine reported last year that sufficient evidence of risk was found only for combined hormone therapy used by postmenopausal women and exposure to ionizing radiation, at doses much higher than those received during a mammogram.

Everyone is exposed to a certain amount of background radiation — about three millisieverts a year from cosmic rays, radon gas and the earth’s radioactive elements. By 1980, according to The Harvard Health Letter, various introduced sources, like medical tests, nuclear power plants, nuclear fallout, television sets, computer monitors, smoke detectors and airport security scanners, added another 0.5 millisieverts per year.

Now, however, the amount of radiation used medically rivals that of the background radiation, adding three millisieverts each year to the average person’s exposure. (A mammogram involves 0.7 millisieverts, a dose that is doubled with a 3-D mammogram.)

There are many reasons for this increase. Doctors in private practice who have bought imaging equipment tend to use it liberally to recoup the expense. The same goes for hospitals just a few miles apart that needlessly duplicate certain equipment so they can boast of having the latest and greatest capacity to detect disease. Doctors ordering tests suffer no adverse effects, and patients feel they are getting the most that modern medicine can offer.

Dr. Lauer wrote in a commentary about cardiac tests, “Most physicians who order imaging tests experience no consequences for incurring costs for procedures of unproven value. On the contrary, they or their colleagues are paid for their services, and their patients don’t complain because the costs are covered by third parties. Patients are pleased to receive thorough evaluations that involve the best cutting-edge technologies.”

According to a new study, the rise in medical imaging clearly goes beyond financial motives. Dr. Smith-Bindman and her colleagues reported in June in The Journal of the American Medical Association that a dramatic rise in imaging rates from 1996 to 2010, including a tripling of CT scans, occurred in six large prepaid health systems where the financial incentive ought to have encouraged fewer, not more, tests. The increased testing doubled the proportion of patients who received high or very high radiation exposures.

By 2010, the researchers reported, 20 CT scans were performed for every 100 adult patients; for every 100 patients ages 65 to 75, about 35 CT scans were done. And among the 10 to 20 percent of children in the study who underwent a single CT scan of the head, radiation doses were in the range previously shown to triple the risk of later developing brain cancer or leukemia.

Dr. Smith-Bindman urged patients to participate in the decision to undergo medical imaging. She said, “Patients should ask, ‘What is this test for? Do I need it? Why? Do I need it now?’ ”

Legislation can help curtail, or at least monitor, radiation doses, she said, citing a California law that took effect in July requiring that the dose used for CT scans be recorded in every patient’s medical record and that inadvertent overdoses be reported to the state immediately.

If such recording were to become a national mandate, electronic medical records could help doctors and patients keep track of radiation exposures and provide further incentive to avoid unnecessary imaging.

Sidebar: Limiting the Fallout of Cancer Treatment

Radiation therapy to treat cancer depends on much higher doses than are used in imaging, and these treatments have long been known to increase a patient’s risk of later developing another cancer. Doctors consider this risk of radiation therapy reasonable when the goal is to prevent death from the original cancer.

Last year in a report in The Lancet Oncology researchers from the National Cancer Institute and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston reported that among 647,672 adult cancer patients treated five or more years earlier, about one half of 1 percent developed a second cancer years later related to radiation treatment of the first cancer. More than half of the second cancers occurred in survivors of breast and prostate cancers.

As expected, the risk of developing a second cancer was highest among those originally treated at younger ages and most often involved organs exposed to the highest doses of radiation.

In recent years, radiologists have taken great pains to limit radiation exposure to nontarget organs — for example, by using a cone beam when treating breast cancer — which should reduce the risk of radiation-induced second cancers."

The patient, a powerfully built middle-aged restaurant worker, had awakened one morning with a tight pain in his shoulders that traveled down his right arm. At work, he could barely shrug his shoulders or turn his head. “My fingers were so weak,” he recalled, “that I couldn’t even get a good grip around a glass of water.”

Doctor and Patient Dr. Pauline Chen on medical care.

A senior doctor at a local clinic diagnosed a pinched nerve and prescribed a muscle relaxant. Two weeks later, only more incapacitated, the patient went to another clinic, where a younger doctor made the right diagnosis: A malignant tumor in his chest was pressing against a nerve to his arm.

“That first doctor couldn’t be bothered by what I was trying to say,” the patient said. He was now receiving chemotherapy and was hopeful his cancer had been caught early enough, but the near miss still haunted him. “He acted like he just didn’t want to be there with me. Or with any patient.”

After reading a study published this week in Archives of Internal Medicine, I’ve been thinking a lot about this patient’s experience. And I’ve come to two conclusions. First, the older doctor had classic symptoms of burnout.

Second, mistakes like his may only become more common.

Research over the last 10 years has shown that burnout – the particular constellation of emotional exhaustion, detachment and a low sense of accomplishment – is widespread among medical students and doctors-in-training. Nearly half of these aspiring doctors end up becoming burned out over the course of their schooling, quickly losing their sense of empathy for others and succumbing to unprofessional behavior like lying and cheating.

Now, in what is the first study of burnout among fully trained doctors from a wide range of specialties, it appears that the young are not the only ones who are vulnerable. Doctors who have been practicing anywhere from a year to several decades are just as susceptible to becoming burned out as students and trainees. And the implications of their burnout — unlike that of their younger counterparts, who are often under supervision — may be more devastating and immediate.

Analyzing questionnaires sent to more than 7,000 doctors, researchers found that almost half complained of being emotionally exhausted, feeling detached from their patients and work or suffering from a low sense of accomplishment. The researchers then compared the doctors’ responses with those of nearly 3,500 people working in other fields and found that even after adjusting for variables like gender, age, number of hours worked and amount of education, the doctors were still more likely to suffer from burnout.

“We’re not talking about a few individuals who are disorganized or not functioning well under pressure; we’re talking about one out of every two doctors who have already survived rigorous training,” said Dr. Tait D. Shanafelt, the lead author of the study and a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “These numbers speak to bigger problems in the larger health care environment.”

The doctors’ burnout appeared to have little to do with hours worked or even the ability to balance personal life with work. Instead, the only factor predictive of a higher risk was practicing a specialty that offered front-line access to care. More than half of the doctors in family medicine, emergency medicine and general internal medicine experienced some form of burnout.

The study casts a grim light on what it is like to practice medicine in the current health care system. A significant proportion of doctors feel trapped, thwarted by the limited time they are allowed to spend with patients, stymied by the ever-changing rules set by insurers and other payers on what they can prescribe or offer as treatment and frustrated by the fact that any gains in efficiency offered by electronic medical records are so soon offset by numerous, newly devised administrative tasks that must also be completed on the computer.

In this setting, “doctors are losing their inspiration,” Dr. Shanafelt said, “and that is a very frightening thing.”

What patients must face in the examining room is no less alarming. Doctors who are suffering from burnout are more prone to errors, less empathetic and more likely to treat patients like diagnoses or objects. They are also more likely to quit practicing altogether, a trend that has serious repercussions in a system already facing a severe doctor shortage as it attempts to expand coverage to 30 million or more currently uninsured Americans.

“Doctors are coming to this expansion already pretty stretched and stressed out,” Dr. Shanafelt noted. “I don’t think there is going to be a lot of room to maneuver without some significant structural changes.”

Dr. Shanafelt and his colleagues are in the midst of studying the effects of workplace initiatives aimed at providing greater support for doctors while improving efficiency, which they believe is critical for doctors and patients as well as the large health care organizations that aim to serve us all. Without decreasing the total hours worked or the number of patients a doctor must see, a hospital system might, for example, restructure its clinics so that doctors could spend more time with patients and less time on the phone getting authorization from insurers or in front of a computer completing administrative tasks.

“If people work in an environment where they believe there is meaning, they will put up with a lot,” Dr. Shanafelt observed. “It goes beyond the significant personal consequences for an individual physician. It affects whom patients can see when they are sick, the quality of care they receive and their safety.”"

The Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in Manhattan, introduced a $1 million public relations campaign on Monday morning with a lofty title: the “Data-Driven Marketing Institute.”

The purpose of the effort is to buff the image and forestall regulation of the consumer data-mining industry. This industry consists of business-to-business companies, known as data brokers, that collect, share, analyze and sell information about consumers’ online and off-line behaviors in order to tailor marketing pitches to them.

According to a statement, the trade group intends to promote such targeted marketing to lawmakers and the public “with the goal of preventing needless regulation or enforcement that could severely hamper consumer marketing and stifle innovation” as well as “tamping down unfavorable media attention.” As part of the campaign, the group plans to finance academic research into the industry’s economic impact, said Linda A. Woolley, the acting chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association.

The group planned to announce the campaign during its annual conference in Las Vegas. It comes as legislators in both the United States House and the Senate have opened investigations into the practices of leading data brokers. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is also investigating certain firms and has called on the industry to increase transparency. Some legislators, regulators and privacy advocates have said they are worried that unregulated collection of marketing data about people’s personal, health and or financial concerns had the potential to result in unfair pricing or inferior service for some consumers.

Ms. Woolley said the industry’s public relations effort was intended to counteract those concerns.

“We want to set the record straight on what we think has been a lot of mischaracterization of what we do and to explain the benefits of data-driven marketing to consumers,” Ms. Woolley said.

One issue the campaign is not designed to address, however, is a recommendation from the F.T.C. earlier this year that the industry set up a public Web portal where consumers could learn about the practices of data brokers and about consumer choices for accessing or deleting information collected about them. Ms. Woolley said so many different types of companies collected or used consumer data for marketing purposes that a public Web portal would be unfeasible.

Still, when consumers learn that third-party companies may collect information about their purchasing records and tastes, at least some people say they would like to be able to see the marketing records data brokers hold about them and have some control over them, said Chuck Teller, the founder of Catalog Choice, a company that helps consumers limit the catalogs, coupons and other direct-mail pitches they receive.

About 67 percent of people who answered a recent e-mail questionnaire sent out by his company said they felt it was very important for them to be able to see the information that data brokers collected about them, while about 78 percent said they felt it was very important to be able to opt out of the distribution and sale of information about them, Mr. Teller said.

“It’s pretty clear that consumers want to opt out of the use of their data by companies they don’t do business with,” Mr. Teller said."

Often the worst part of a visit to the doctor isn’t the awkward hospital gown, needle sticks or embarrassing physical exams — it’s the drawn-out wait, camped out in the reception room in the company of sick patients and old magazines.

During a particularly long wait to see his dermatologist, Parker Oks, 18, thought there had to be a better way.

“They know approximately how long an appointment will take,” said Mr. Oks, a freshman at Boston University. “But the problem is that they don’t know how long it will actually take.”

That realization led Mr. Oks to create Appointment Status, a Web site devoted to improving appointment efficiency and providing patients with information to avoid long waits. Working with three teenagers from Staten Island Technical High School, where he had gone, Mr. Oks aims to make it easier for patients to schedule appointments — and to find out how far behind the doctor may be before settling into a waiting room chair.

It’s one of several innovations meant to help patients. While many digital developments — electronic medical records and mobile medical encyclopedias — have streamlined doctors’ work, new tools for patients are starting to hit cellphones and the Internet offering help in keeping track of medications, recording heart rate and glucose levels and managing personal and family medical history, among other tasks.

Appointment Status is designed to assist patients before they even take a seat in a waiting room — a sore point for many patients, as doctors well know. In a survey conducted by the doctor-review Web site Vitals, patients reported an average wait time of 21 minutes to see a doctor. Mississippi had the longest reported wait time, at just over 25 minutes.

Some patients say that’s about as long a wait as they will tolerate.

“I’m willing to wait to see a doctor for about 20 minutes before I go talk to the receptionist, and after a 45-minute wait, I always leave and reschedule,” said Maureen Green, a journalist from Syracuse. “Everybody’s time is valuable, not just the doctor’s time.”

Developers and entrepreneurs are starting to tap into this frustration, as well as other rifts in doctor-patient relations. Mr. Oks said his next step is a mobile app to inform patients about delays.

Another service, ZocDoc, is also meant to help patients save time with doctor visits. Created by Cyrus Massoumi, Dr. Oliver Kharraz and Nick Ganju, ZocDoc allows patients to peer into a doctor’s appointment book and schedule a visit through the Web.

ZocDoc has already been expanded with a new tool, ZocDoc Check-In, made available last month to help eliminate another cause of waiting room tedium: filling out a clipboard of forms.

“You’re always handed a stack of forms to fill out when you enter a doctor’s office,” said Mr. Massoumi, the chief executive of ZocDoc. “And all the information is 80 percent the same as the last time you filled it out.”

ZocDoc Check-In also enters patient’s personal information in other doctors’ forms, so there is no need to fill out a name and date of birth multiple times.

While these kinds of tools are becoming more common — ZocDoc is now being used in more than a thousand cities by doctors in more than 40 specialties — Mr. Oks is facing some resistance to his Appointment Status app.

“A lot of the doctors I’ve approached are set in their ways and skeptical,” Mr. Oks said. “We’ve found some offices don’t even have an Internet connection for their receptionists.”

ZocDoc may have caught on because it helps doctors as well as patients.

“It’s a win-win,” Mr. Massoumi said. “Patients need convenience in scheduling a doctor’s appointment, and from a doctor’s standpoint, ZocDoc brings them patients and helps office staff manage their time.”

Nevertheless, Mr. Massoumi said it took him a while to reach the point that doctors contact him about obtaining the technology.

Dr. Kamal Ramani, a general practitioner in Manhattan, said he adopted ZocDoc three years ago, when he moved his office and was looking for a way to save time and money.

“My staff doesn’t have to be on the phone with patients suggesting time slots,” Dr. Ramani said. “It streamlines the appointment-making process on both ends.”

At the same time, some new technology that was developed for more efficient medical care delivery has some benefits for patients as well. For instance, despite widespread concerns about security and the potential for errors, electronic medical records can save patients time and improve communication.

Dr. Steven K. Magid, a rheumatologist whose office is at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said that initially he was worried about the time commitment needed to enter all of a patient’s information digitally, but now he sees the benefits.

“It’s faster for me to write a list of medications on a piece of paper than to do it on the computer,” Dr. Magid said. “But on the back end I save time because everything is legible and everyone is working off the same list.”

Patients’ treatment instructions are clearly typed out, generating fewer calls to his office — and to him. And when patients still are confused or a new matter arises, his staff can address the problem without him by looking up the information in the digital record.

Eventually, say some, patients will expect their doctors to adopt these kinds of timesaving tools.

“There’s a tipping point,” Dr. Magid said. “There is going to be a shift.”"

Does anybody know?,"A study published in the journal Health Affairs in October estimated that a mere 5.2 percent of Medicare Part D beneficiaries chose the cheapest coverage that met their needs. All in all, consumers appear to be wasting roughly $11 billion a year on their Part D coverage, partly, I think, because they don’t get reliable answers to straightforward questions.

Here’s a snapshot of my surreal experience:

NOV. 7 A packet from Time Warner informs me that the company’s new 2013 Retiree Health Care Plan has “no out-of-pocket limit on your expenses.” But Erin, the person who answers at the company’s Benefits Service Center, tells me that the new plan will have “no practical effect” on me. What about the $1,000-a-year cap on drug costs? Is that really being eliminated? “Yes,” she says, “there’s no limit on out-of-pocket expenses in 2013.” I tell her I think that could have a major effect on me.

Next I talk to David at CVS/Caremark, Time Warner’s new drug insurance provider. He thinks my out-of-pocket cost for Revlimid next year will be $6,900. He says, “I know I’m scaring you.”

I call back Erin at Time Warner. She mentions something about $10,000 and says she’ll get an estimate for me in two business days.

NOV. 8 I phone Medicare. Jay says that if I switch to Medicare’s Part D prescription coverage, with a new provider, Revlimid’s cost will drive me into Medicare’s “catastrophic coverage.” I’d pay $2,819 the first month, and 5 percent of the cost of the drug thereafter — $563 a month or maybe $561. Anyway, roughly $9,000 for the year. Jay says AARP’s Part D plan may be a good option.

NOV. 9 Erin at Time Warner tells me that the company’s policy bundles United Healthcare medical coverage with CVS/Caremark’s drug coverage. I can’t accept the medical plan and cherry-pick prescription coverage elsewhere. It’s take it or leave it. Then she puts CVS’s Michele on the line to get me a Revlimid quote. Michele says Time Warner hasn’t transferred my insurance information. She can’t give me a quote without it. Erin says she will not call me with an update. I’ll have to call her.

My oncologist’s assistant steers me to Celgene, Revlimid’s manufacturer. Jennifer in “patient support” says premium assistance grants can cut the cost of Revlimid to $20 or $30 a month. She says, “You’re going to be O.K.” If my income is low enough to qualify for assistance.

NOV. 12 I try CVS again. Christine says my insurance records still have not been transferred, but she thinks my Revlimid might cost $17,000 a year.

Adriana at Medicare warns me that AARP and other Part D providers will require “prior authorization” to cover my Revlimid, so it’s probably best to stick with Time Warner no matter what the cost.

But Brooke at AARP insists that I don’t need prior authorization for my Revlimid, and so does her supervisor Brian — until he spots a footnote. Then he assures me that it will be easy to get prior authorization. All I need is a doctor’s note. My out-of-pocket cost for 2013: roughly $7,000.

NOV. 13 Linda at CVS says her company still doesn’t have my file, but from what she can see about Time Warner’s insurance plans my cost will be $60 a month — $720 for the year.

CVS assigns my case to Rebecca. She says she’s “sure all will be fine.” Well, “pretty sure.” She’s excited. She’s been with the company only a few months. This will be her first quote.

NOV. 14 Giddens at Time Warner puts in an “emergency update request” to get my files transferred to CVS.

NOV. 15 Angelina at Celgene walks me through the assistance program. The income cutoff for aid in New York City is $60,000 a year. But the rules about calculating income are fuzzy. No one can say whether I’d qualify.

Giddens tells me that he has upgraded his “emergency request” to “critical.”

NOV. 16 Rebecca at CVS calls to say my maximum out-of-pocket for Revlimid will be $6,900, but it quickly becomes clear that she’s looking at the wrong insurance plan.

Giddens at Time Warner calls to say he has my 2013 policy group number. He thinks that is all we need to get an accurate quote from CVS. He gets Tracy at CVS on the line. She disagrees. She says she needs my actual file. Giddens has news for both of us. No Time Warner retiree files will be transferred until December — despite the Dec. 7 open enrollment deadline.

I call Medicare again. I get a different Jay than the last time. This Jay says a private insurer will cost $500 more a month than my employer. He tells me to ask Time Warner for my policy’s “Medicare contract number.” With that number, CVS will definitely be able to see what Revlimid will cost.

Giddens at Time Warner says he has “no access” to the contract number, whatever that is.

I call back Rebecca at CVS. Using my policy group number, she says my cost will be $60 a month. She says she and her supervisor are “absolutely sure.” I ask if she will put that quote in writing. She says yes. Minutes later, she sends an e-mail confirming the quote. It seems my best bet is to stick with Time Warner’s coverage after all.

NOV. 19 Angelina at Celgene calls to see how I’m doing. I tell her I have a $60 quote in writing, but I’m still worried that someone higher up at CVS will overrule it when I submit my first claim. “It’s crazy with these insurance companies,” she says. “I think you’ll be fine. But it’s kind of scary at the same time.”

Yes, it’s kind of scary."

“We are going to get a huge amount of data,” David C. Vladeck, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the F.T.C., said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “We are going to get answers.”

In an e-mail, Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, the chief privacy officer of Acxiom, said the company had not yet received the F.T.C.’s letter, but was looking forward to cooperating with the inquiry. “We consider this request as an avenue to promote a better understanding of why what we do is vital for the American economy as it creates enormous value for people and businesses while respecting and protecting consumers’ interests,” she wrote.

Gordon Meyer, the chief executive of eBureau, wrote in an e-mail that the consumer scoring company “welcomes the opportunity to describe, to the F.T.C., its practices and the benefits we provide to businesses as well as consumers.”

Representatives of other companies did not return e-mails seeking comment.

Companies and organizations in the United States spend more than $2 billion a year on third-party data about individuals, according to a report last year on personal identity management from Forrester Research, a market research firm. That figure does not include spending on market research and customer data analytics, the report said.

Industry representatives argue that their practices benefit consumers. Data brokers, they say, collect information about individuals’ purchasing histories, estimated salaries, property ownership, family size, leisure pursuits — and sometimes also their race or ethnicity, age, gender, health concerns, online browsing history and social networks — to help marketers tailor pitches to a person’s demonstrated tastes. When these bespoke ad systems work properly, the companies argue, marketers can identify male Southern Californians who surf and show them ads for board shorts even as they avoid sending coupons for ski vacations to people who prefer Alaskan cruises.

But, as consumers conduct more of their personal and commercial lives online, that type of data collection has been steadily increasing, fueled by new online surveillance techniques and more sophisticated analytics. Some companies, for example, have compiled several thousand different pieces of information on a majority of adults in the United States. Regulators say they are concerned that such comprehensive data collection could be used to profile, score or segment consumers, with the potential to unfairly limit the kinds of financial, insurance, health, education or other marketing offers certain consumers receive.

Mr. Vladeck of the F.T.C. offered one possibility he worried about: a hypothetical consumer who buys a deep-fat fryer online may get typecast by data broker systems as a health risk, and then is passed over for marketing pitches for insurance or other services.

“Data brokers aggregate huge amounts of data on individuals and have the capacity to create powerful profiles combining information about what you do offline and online,” Mr. Vladeck said. “We worry that this information may be used in ways that could be harmful to consumers.”

Industry representatives disagreed, saying that their ethics guidelines prohibited companies from using consumer marketing data for eligibility decisions like credit, insurance or employment. Targeted marketing pitches based on data collection about an individual, they added, do not limit a consumer from seeking out financial, insurance or other services on their own.

“It changes what comes to you, what you will see in a banner ad or an ad along the side of your Web searches,” said Jerry Cerasale, senior vice president for government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, an industry trade group. “But it doesn’t create a barrier for you to look elsewhere.”

In March, the F.T.C. issued a report on consumer privacy, calling on data brokers to make their practices clearer to the public. Some legislators and regulators say they are taking a harder look at the industry because of practices that are opaque to consumers.

Unlike consumer reporting agencies, for example, which are required by federal law to show consumers their credit reports and allow them to correct errors in their own records, data brokers who collect and sell consumer information for marketing purposes are not required to give individuals access to the records those companies hold about them. In a report earlier this year, the F.T.C. asked Congress to consider enacting regulations to give consumers some rights to data collected about them.

Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who opened an examination of the industry in July, along with Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, said the investigations would help legislators and regulators develop a system of oversight, giving consumers more access to and control over data collected about them.

“Consumers should have the right to know what is being collected about them, notice that the information is going to be used for purposes other than originally intended, and the right to say no,” he said. “ ‘Knowledge, notice and no,’ that has always been my motto.”"

When it comes to privacy, we are all hypocrites. We howl when a newspaper publishes public records about personal behavior. At the same time, we are acquiescing in a much more sweeping erosion of our privacy — government surveillance, corporate data-mining, political microtargeting, hacker invasions — with no comparable outpouring of protest. As a society we have no coherent view of what information is worth defending and how to defend it.

When our privacy is invaded in the name of national security, we — and our elected representatives, afraid to be thought soft — generally go along quietly. Our complacency is reinforced by a popular culture that has forsaken Orwell’s nightmares for a benign view of authority. In many of my own guilty-pleasure television favorites — “The Wire,” the British thriller series “MI-5,” the Danish original of “The Killing,” the addictive “Homeland” — surveillance is what the good guys do, and it saves the day.

Meanwhile, as Al Qaeda wanes, our surveillance state continues to grow more intrusive, with woefully little oversight or accountability.

Last month Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal disclosed that Attorney General Eric Holder had authorized the National Counterterrorism Center to copy and examine pretty much any information the government has collected about you. In the past, the agency couldn’t store information about ordinary Americans unless they were suspects in or party to a specific investigation. Under the new orders, flight records, lists of Americans hosting foreign-exchange students, financial records of people seeking federally backed mortgages, health records of patients at veterans’ hospitals — pick a database, and this obscure agency has permission to study it for patterns that ostensibly predict terrorist behavior, and to share it with foreign governments, whether or not you are suspected of any wrongdoing. The new rules were subjected to robust official debate — all behind closed doors.

Likewise, while we were all distracted by the dance on the fiscal cliff, the 112th Congress in its final days whisked through a renewal of the law that governs eavesdropping by American intelligence agencies on Americans’ phone calls and e-mail traffic. A couple of senators made modest attempts to hold the eavesdroppers more accountable by, for example, disclosing the number of law-abiding citizens whose communications have been intercepted. Their efforts were voted down.

“The Obama administration’s position on privacy is basically ‘Trust us, we’re good guys,’ ” said Daniel Solove of George Washington University, whose book “Nothing to Hide” challenges the myth that law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear from government snooping. “That’s exactly what Bush said. And it’s also the same thing that any despot says. We shouldn’t have to trust.”

Rigorous, independent oversight, he added, not only protects against abuses but also helps assure that what we do in the name of security actually works. But it doesn’t happen if we don’t demand it.

The government, of course, is not the only — not even the most aggressive — invader. You can take your pick of the ways Facebook and Google are monetizing you by serving up your personal profile and browsing habits to advertisers for profit. Some of this feels harmless, or even useful — why shouldn’t my mobile device serve me ads tailored to my interests? But some of it is flat-out creepy. One of the more obnoxious trends is the custom-targeting of that irresistibly vulnerable market, our children.

When our personal information is exploited this way, we may grumble, or we may seek the largely false comfort of tweaking our privacy settings, but we feel helpless before the mystifying rush of technology.

You would think the one sort of invasion just about everyone deplores was hacking. But even there we are ambivalent. When Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids were caught pillaging the voice mail of celebrities, the public response was muted; when it turned out that they had hacked the phone of a 13-year-old murder victim, the pitchforks and torches came out.

Or take the Steubenville case. In Steubenville, Ohio, authorities charged two members of the high school football team with the repeated rape of a passed-out-drunk 16-year-old, but did not charge the many others who allegedly cheered them on and made videos. So the online activists of Anonymous took it upon themselves to hack into private accounts, recover deleted and incriminating videos, and make them public. Amanda Marcotte wrestled with the moral dilemma on Slate: “By stepping in and holding people accountable, Anonymous stands a very good chance of taking action that actually does something to stop rape. But: This type of online vigilante justice is potentially invading the privacy of or defaming innocent Steubenville residents, and even if everything published is true, there are very serious legal limits to the Anonymous strategy.”

As a journalist, I’m more often on the side of the invaders than the invaded. I cherish the freedom to publish. But the freedom to publish includes the freedom not to publish when the cost outweighs the benefit.

Which brings me back to The Journal News and its gun project. I sympathize with the paper’s effort to dramatize the commonplace reality of gun ownership at a time when the subject is so sadly on our minds. I don’t buy the gun owners’ assertion that the disclosure is an invitation to burglars in search of firearms; on the contrary, the publicity sends criminals the same message as those front-door notices of your home alarm system: Try next door. It’s also conceivable that the attention will prompt some owners to lock up unsecured weapons.

But when you are going to make a sizable population of law-abiding citizens feel violated, you have to ask yourself, what is the offsetting gain? In this case, I think, not much. The information The Journal News provided its readers is so far from complete as to be misleading. The public records identify only legal handguns. They tell you nothing about the neighbor who has an equally legal and equally lethal rifle or shotgun, let alone an illegal weapon. The publication has not spurred a healthy debate; it has merely escalated a shouting match, and given the N.R.A. a new rallying cry. The outcry may even provoke state legislatures to withdraw gun databases from public records, so they will not be available when they might really be useful. It’s a close call, but I’d have found a different way to make the point."

A series of high-profile hacking attacks on governments and businesses has galvanized European lawmakers to focus on the need to strengthen and harmonize existing laws, which vary widely across the Union and differ on the levels of disclosure required.

In Britain alone, businesses and governments reported 821 cyberattacks in 2011, 15 percent of which resulted in the theft of data on individuals, according to the country’s Information Commissioner’s Office. The attacks represented a more than tenfold increase over the 79 incidents reported in 2007. In one of the breaches, health officials in Scotland reported, the medical records of 104 children had been compromised.

Big companies in Britain are attacked about once a week on average by cybercriminals seeking data, and small businesses are targeted once a month, according to a survey last year of 400 businesses by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The cost to the biggest companies of taking the steps necessary to repel an attack and deal with the damage caused by one can reach about £250,000, or $400,000.

Karin Retzer, a lawyer in Brussels who advises businesses on compliance with European data protection laws, said it was hard to say whether European lawmakers would ultimately adopt the rules, the first effort of the kind worldwide.

“We are in a fairly early stage,” said Ms. Retzer, of the firm Morrison & Foerster. “There is a lot of opposition.”

Under E.U. law adopted in 2009, the operators of critical “communications infrastructure” are supposed to follow guidelines on reporting data breaches, but Ms. Retzer said enforcement was spotty at best. Many E.U. countries have applied the mandate only to phone companies, while others have rules on paper for Web businesses but have never enforced them.

Mrs. Kroes, a Dutch economist, made data security a priority when she took over the position of digital agenda commissioner in 2010. Early last year, she drafted the outlines of an E.U.-wide strategy for cybersecurity with Cecilia Malmstrom, the home affairs commissioner, and Catherine Ashton, the E.U.’s representative for foreign policy

The proposal was supposed to be released last September, but now is expected to be reviewed by the European Commission on Jan. 30. According to a copy of the plan seen by the International Herald Tribune, the new reporting requirements would be applied to, among others, the “enablers of Internet services, e-commerce platforms, Internet payment gateways, social networks, search engines, cloud computing services, application stores.”

The proposal directs E.U. countries to impose penalties on organizations that do not heed the notification rules, and requires them to craft national disclosure laws that are “appropriate, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

Liam Benham, a vice president in charge of governmental programs at I.B.M. Europe, whose cloud-based computing services could be affected by any new reporting mandates, said the reporting requirements should be limited to the operators of critical infrastructure, like power grids, financial networks and transport systems.

“It could subject a wide array of industries to sweeping new regulation, and appears to mandate technology standards largely written by government, not industry,” Mr. Benham said.

To become law, the proposal must be adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers. Mrs. Kroes, through a spokesman, said she aimed to improve the security of European data networks, not necessarily set new data protection standards. It would be negligent, she said, to exclude the technology and Web companies from the reporting requirements, given the rapid shift of many computing resources to remote “cloud” centers.

“Cybersecurity is too important to leave to chance, to the good will of individual companies,” Mrs. Kroes said in a statement. She plans to publicly present details of the plan on Friday. “Network security problems that can affect everyone have a clear public interest dimension,” she said.

Support for a uniform European approach to cybersecurity could be significant, as long as a balance is struck between consumer and business interests. Four in 10 consumers in the Union avoid making online purchases because of concern about the security of their personal data, according to the commission.

In public comments on the proposal, collected from July 23 to Oct. 15, two-thirds of the 160 groups, individuals and organizations that responded said they would favor E.U. rules to regulate the notification of data breaches. Nearly 9 in 10 respondents said the requirement should include Internet services.

The piecemeal system of national oversight in Europe has been criticized by the European Network and Information Security Agency as inadequate. But the agency, which advises the commission and is supposed to ensure the security of the bloc’s critical infrastructure, warned in 2011 that short-staffed national regulators might be overwhelmed by broad new E.U. requirements that could generate thousands of notifications.

In the United States, Web businesses are not required to give notification of data breaches, and rules are enforced by state, not national, governments. Most of the state laws are modeled on a 2003 California law, the country’s first. As in Europe, attempts to create a national U.S. reporting mandate have foundered in the face of industry opposition.

In November, the U.S. Senate defeated a cybersecurity bill sponsored by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Senator Susan M. Collins, a Republican from Maine, that would have encouraged water and electric utilities and transport network operators to improve the security of their computer systems. The bill, supported by the administration of President Barack Obama, had been opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had argued that it would saddle businesses with extra costs."

Between 2008 and 2012, a time of intense lobbying in the area around the passage of the legislation and how the rules for government incentives would be shaped, Mr. Tullman personally made $225,000 in political contributions. While tens of thousands of those dollars went to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, money was also being sprinkled toward Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic senator from Montana who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Jay D. Rockefeller, the Democrat from West Virginia who heads the Commerce Committee. Mr. Tullman said his recent personal contributions to various politicians had largely been driven by his interest in supporting President Obama and in seeing his re-election.

Cerner’s lobbying dollars doubled to nearly $400,000 between 2006 and last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While its political action committee contributed a little to some Democrats in 2008, including Senator Baucus, its contributions last year went almost entirely to Republicans, with a large amount going to the Mitt Romney campaign.

Current and former industry executives say that big digital records companies like Cerner, Allscripts and Epic Systems of Verona, Wis., have reaped enormous rewards because of the legislation they pushed for. “Nothing that these companies did in my eyes was spectacular,” said John Gomez, the former head of technology at Allscripts. “They grew as a result of government incentives.”

Executives at smaller records companies say the legislation cemented the established companies’ leading positions in the field, making it difficult for others to break into the business and innovate. Until the 2009 legislation, growth at the leading records firms was steady; since then, it has been explosive. Annual sales growth at Cerner, for instance, has doubled to 20 percent from 10 percent.

“We called it the Sunny von Bülow bill. These companies that should have been dead were being put on machines and kept alive for another few years,” said Jonathan Bush, co-founder of the cloud-based firm Athenahealth and a first cousin to former President George W. Bush. “The biggest players drew this incredible huddle around the rule-makers and the rules are ridiculously favorable to these companies and ridiculously unfavorable to society.”

This industry, which was pioneered in the late 1970s, first gained widespread attention in 2004 when President Bush in his State of the Union speech called for digitizing national health records.

“After that, every technology C.E.O. wanting a piece of health care would have visited me every day if I had let them,” said David Brailer, whom President Bush appointed as the nation’s first health information czar. Over the next few years, Cerner and many of the other health care data companies increased their presence on Capitol Hill.

The records systems sold by the biggest vendors have their fans, who argue that, among other things, the systems ease prescribing medications electronically. But these systems also have many critics, who contend that they can be difficult to use, cannot share patient information with other systems and are sometimes adding hours to the time physicians spend documenting patient care.

“On a really good day, you might be able to call the system mediocre, but most of the time, it’s lousy,” said Michael Callaham, the chairman of the department of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, which eight months ago turned on its $160 million digital records system from Epic. Michael Blum, the hospital’s chief medical information officer, said a majority of doctors there like the Epic system.

Whatever the case, the legislation has been a windfall to top executives at the leading health records companies. Neal L. Patterson, who grew up on a farm near Manchester, Okla., population 100, co-founded Cerner in 1979. As Cerner’s sales have soared in recent years, so have Mr. Patterson’s fortunes. From 2007 to 2011, he received more than $21 million in total compensation, according to the executive compensation research firm Equilar, and his stake in the company is worth $1 billion.

In recent years, Mr. Patterson and his wife, Jeanne Lillig-Patterson, who ran as a Republican for Congress in 2004, have emerged as social and business leaders in the Kansas City, Mo., area. Mr. Patterson is also co-owner of a real estate development firm whose ventures include a 1,200-acre community near Kansas City called the Village of Loch Lloyd, featuring a Tom Watson-designed golf course.

A spokeswoman for Cerner said Mr. Patterson was unavailable for comment.

The medical records industry did not have much of a presence in Washington before President Bush highlighted it in 2004. Then in November that year, the industry created its first association, HIMSS, which includes health care providers, corporations and not-for-profit organizations, to make the case for electronic records. Its founding members included Allscripts, Cerner and Epic.

Four years later, in December 2008, H. Stephen Lieber, chief executive of the group, wrote an open letter to President-elect Obama calling for a minimum government investment of $25 billion to help hospitals and physicians adopt electronic records. The industry ultimately got at least $19 billion in federal and state money.

In the months after that windfall arrived, sales climbed for leading vendors as hospitals and physicians scrambled to buy systems to meet tight timetables to collect the incentive dollars. At Allscripts, Mr. Tullman soon announced what looked like a game-changing deal: the acquisition of another records company, Eclipsys, for $1.3 billion.

“We are at the beginning of what we believe will be the fastest transformation of any industry in U.S. history,” Mr. Tullman said when the deal was announced.

Last spring, some of the Eclipsys board members left after a power struggle; Mr. Tullman left in December. He is now at a company he co-founded that focuses on solar energy — another area that, after Obama administration and Congress expanded government incentives in the 2009 stimulus bill, has been swept by a gold-rush mentality, too."

Canada’s Medicare program — phased in at the same time as the American version — shows how we can make Medicare simpler and thriftier, while simultaneously upgrading its coverage. Canada’s program covers all Canadians (not just the elderly) under a single public program in each province, and bans co-payments and deductibles.

Patients can choose any doctor and hospital. Cutting out private insurers and the complexity and fragmentation they impose has simplified paperwork for patients, doctors and hospitals. Administrative costs are roughly half United States levels, saving more than $1,000 per capita.

Over all, Medicare spending on the elderly has grown three times faster in the United States than in Canada since 1980, while life expectancy (for the elderly, as for all age groups) has grown faster in Canada. If American Medicare costs had risen at Canadian rates, we’d have saved more than $2 trillion by now, and Medicare’s trust fund would show a healthy surplus.

As a professional and a Medicare subscriber, I have found the program’s customer service to be unfailingly efficient and polite. I could never say the same for private insurers. I agree with Mr. Cassidy that rather than cut Medicare, we can change it, but I believe that I might differ in how.

Our Congress can change Medicare if it is serious about real savings. How many billions would it save to cut all subsidies for Medicare Advantage plans; allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D with pharmaceutical companies; and take for-profit companies out of Part D entirely?

Medicare is seamless in paying my fees, and paying for care when I need it. The fees Medicare pays are very low, and cutting them further is not a good cost-cutting maneuver. It hurts small businesses like mine and that of my primary care physician; both of us have the same expenses we have always had.

Medicare could run its own show with no private subsidies to for-profit entities. We seniors would be better off.

Boston, Feb. 20, 2013

The writer is a clinical psychologist.

Mr. Cassidy’s proposed fix is sensible but is far short of what is needed.

Medicare is headed for bankruptcy because it depends largely on open-ended fee-for-service payment of almost any services providers choose to deliver, at prices mainly determined by the providers. Compounding the problem, most providers act like independent businesses seeking to increase their income, regardless of whether they are for-profit or investor-owned.

An effective Medicare fix would require a new payment system that prospectively pays providers for comprehensive care at a rate set by a single public payer. It would also need a not-for-profit medical care system based on multispecialty doctor groups that pay physicians by salary, thus minimizing incentives to deliver duplicative or unnecessary care.

The new system would have to be mandatory for all citizens, including legislators, and it would have to be financed by a progressive, earmarked health care tax.

Obviously, such reform would be slow and difficult, but so would any other change that threatened vested interests. All reform will depend on an aroused public opinion.

The Medicare patient has an incentive to accept expensive treatment because it seems to be free and is enthusiastically recommended by the physician. The physician has an incentive to offer high-cost services because she is paid well to do so. Compensate physicians on almost any basis other than piecework fee-for-service, and you remove the incentive to overtreat.

In the end, the appetite of Americans for Medicare treatment will always exceed the capacity of the Medicare system to provide it while controlling costs. By any other name, cost containment requires rationing (limitation) of services.

Rationing medical services is not itself immoral. Some methods of rationing are often inequitable. After all, we ration by a person’s ability to afford insurance. The most effective rationing is achieved when an unnecessary medical service is neither requested by the patient nor recommended by the physician. Properly structuring incentives makes this more likely.

The writer is a retired surgeon.

Mr. Cassidy’s plea to simplify the rules for gaining access to Medicare benefits makes good sense, but doing so will not be enough to “fix Medicare.”

The greatest threat to Medicare’s continued ability to serve elderly and disabled Americans is its failure so far to contain its spending. Indeed, the failure to contain health care costs is a characteristic of the American health care system as a whole.

A multipronged approach can help reach the goals of more reliable quality of care and lower costs: paying providers to care for patients instead of to provide individual services; electronic medical records and other advances that can increase the probability that the services doctors recommend will really benefit patients; and new provider organizations — accountable care organizations — that take responsibility for the health of the patients who enroll with them.

This strategy can both improve the quality of services provided and bring health system costs under control. It will take time, and it won’t be easy.

Providers and patients alike will need to learn from unfolding experience. If successful, the payoff will be durable improvements not only to Medicare but to the American health care system as a whole.

The writer, a professor at the Boston University School of Management, is the author of the forthcoming book “A New Era in U.S. Health Care: Critical Next Steps Under the Affordable Care Act.”

Mr. Cassidy discusses various problems facing Medicare, in particular its solvency and transparency. With respect to the first issue, it may be worth noting that any remnant of personal responsibility is completely lacking in the program.

There are numerous health problems that are a result of lifestyle choices, including emphysema (smoking) and obesity (lack of exercise and poor eating habits). But Medicare pays regardless of the cause.

If one burns down his own house, insurance payments are generally withheld. Withholding such payments for problems caused by irresponsible behavior would have two effects. There would be an immediate savings in Medicare costs, while in the long run people would be healthier, their poor choices no longer being subsidized.

Such an approach may appear draconian to some, but all the low-lying fruit has already been picked. Eventually, difficult choices have to be made.

The Writer Responds

As Drs. Woolhandler and Himmelstein say, there are lessons in efficiency and simplicity to be learned from Canada’s single public health program, which provides coverage for all Canadians. But after the polarizing campaign that resulted in the passage of the Affordable Care Act, legislators in the United States have sent a clear message that the fragmentation in the health care system, like Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance, will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

As a result, Medicare cannot rely on a single-payer system to rescue it from dysfunction. Instead, Medicare can and must make meaningful changes for beneficiaries and providers alike. As I said before, Medicare should be simple to use, easy to understand and affordable for beneficiaries. But reform must also include cost containment to save Medicare for future generations.

Although the new types of payment systems recommended independently by Professor Davidson and Dr. Relman provide a far better approach for controlling skyrocketing costs than today’s fee-for-service model, these types of fundamental reforms are uncertain and take time.

Medicare must immediately reduce its risk for exploitation, whether by outright fraud or billing for medically unnecessary services. Medicare processes more than four million claims each business day from 1.5 million providers. Trying to identify all of the bogus claims submitted to Medicare is an insurmountable challenge.

Therefore, to protect the integrity of the program, Medicare must raise enrollment standards so that only first-rate professionals and businesses with established credentials can earn the privilege to participate in the program.

The time to act is now; time is not on our side.

A separate study by university researchers found similar problems in many state Medicaid programs. The study, published this month in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, described “inadequate management of conflicts of interest” among the panels that recommend drugs for coverage under Medicaid.

Medicare and Medicaid account for more than 30 percent of retail spending on prescription drugs. The inspector general examined the records of 111 panels that establish lists of preferred drugs, known as formularies, for Medicare’s prescription drug plans.

Ann Maxwell, a regional inspector general in Chicago who worked on the study, said: “We found very little oversight by the insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We found that the agency does not directly oversee insurance companies’ compliance with federal conflict-of-interest requirements.”

Some committees did not collect any personal financial information from panel members. “The members were required only to sign a form stating whether they had financial interests or conflicts of interest,” the report said.

More than half of the committees did not have procedures to review the financial holdings of panel members to see if they had conflicts of interest, it said.

“Additionally,” the report said, “23 percent of pharmacy and therapeutics committees did not have recusal policies” requiring members to abstain from discussions or votes when they had conflicts of interest related to a particular drug.

Since Medicare officials do not monitor conflicts of interest, Mr. Levinson said, they cannot be sure that prescription drug plans are complying with federal requirements that at least two committee members — one practicing physician and one pharmacist — be “independent and free of conflict.”

Marilyn B. Tavenner, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, defended her agency’s work and said beneficiaries were adequately protected.

The inspector general “did not identify any actual conflicts of interest,” she said, and “we do not believe it is necessary for us” to establish a uniform definition or standards for managing conflicts.

Ms. Tavenner, who has been nominated by President Obama to lead the agency, said Medicare officials reviewed each insurer’s list of covered drugs to make sure beneficiaries had access to a wide range of medications for various diseases.

The only effect of a conflict of interest, she said, is that premiums might be higher. “Beneficiaries could easily evaluate these higher premiums in the marketplace and choose a more efficient plan to meet their needs,” Ms. Tavenner said.

A few state Medicaid programs have conflict-of-interest policies more stringent than federal Medicare rules. Washington State, for example, says drug-selection committee members have a potential conflict if they have received “any remuneration, grants or other compensation from a pharmaceutical manufacturer or a pharmaceutical benefits management company.”

Benefit managers are often hired by insurers to obtain lower prices through negotiations with drug makers. When members of a drug-selection committee invest in a benefit manager, Mr. Levinson said, they have a potential conflict of interest because they stand to gain financially from decisions to cover a particular drug."

The only job she could hold would be one where she does not have to stand or sit longer than 20 minutes, otherwise pain screams down her spine and up her legs.

“Damaged goods,” Ms. Farley describes herself, recalling how she recently overheard a child whispering to her mother about whether the “crippled lady” was a meth addict.

For about five years, Ms. Farley, 45, stood alongside about a dozen other workers, spray gun in hand, gluing together foam cushions for chairs and couches sold under brand names like Broyhill, Ralph Lauren and Thomasville. Fumes from the glue formed a yellowish fog inside the plant, and Ms. Farley’s doctors say that breathing them in eventually ate away at her nerve endings, resulting in what she and her co-workers call “dead foot.”

A chemical she handled — known as n-propyl bromide, or nPB — is also used by tens of thousands of workers in auto body shops, dry cleaners and high-tech electronics manufacturing plants across the nation. Medical researchers, government officials and even chemical companies that once manufactured nPB have warned for over a decade that it causes neurological damage and infertility when inhaled at low levels over long periods, but its use has grown 15-fold in the past six years.

Such hazards demonstrate the difficulty, despite decades of effort, of ensuring that Americans can breathe clean air on the job. Even as worker after worker fell ill, records from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration show that managers at Royale Comfort Seating, where Ms. Farley was employed, repeatedly exposed gluers to nPB levels that exceeded levels federal officials considered safe, failed to provide respirators and turned off fans meant to vent fumes.

But the story of the rise of nPB and the decline of Ms. Farley’s health is much more than the tale of one company, or another chapter in the national debate over the need for more, or fewer, government regulations. Instead, it is a parable about the law of unintended consequences.

It shows how an Environmental Protection Agency program meant to prevent the use of harmful chemicals fostered the proliferation of one, and how a hard-fought victory by OSHA in controlling one source of deadly fumes led workers to be exposed to something worse — a phenomenon familiar enough to be lamented in government parlance as “regrettable substitution.”

It demonstrates how businesses at once both suffer from and exploit the fitful and disjointed way that the government tries to protect workers, and why occupational illnesses have proved so hard to prevent.

And it highlights a startling fact: OSHA, the watchdog agency that many Americans love to hate and industry often faults as overzealous, has largely ignored long-term threats. Partly out of pragmatism, the agency created by President Richard M. Nixon to give greater attention to health issues has largely done the opposite.

OSHA devotes most of its budget and attention to responding to here-and-now dangers rather than preventing the silent, slow killers that, in the end, take far more lives. Over the past four decades, the agency has written new standards with exposure limits for 16 of the most deadly workplace hazards, including lead, asbestos and arsenic. But for the tens of thousands of other dangerous substances American workers handle each day, employers are largely left to decide what exposure level is safe.

By contrast, OSHA has two dozen pages of regulations just on ladders and stairs.

“I’m the first to admit this is broken,” said David Michaels, the OSHA director, referring to the agency’s record on dealing with workplace health threats. “Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people end up on the gurney.”

Royale Comfort Seating disputes that Ms. Farley’s health problems and those of some other workers were linked to their jobs. Company officials also say that while they have sought to safeguard their workers, they have also feared losing jobs to foreign competitors, as many of their industry counterparts in North Carolina have.

Royale has not switched away from the nPB glues, managers said, because alternatives did not work well, were sometimes more dangerous and were almost always more expensive.

“We, as a company, are also in a tight spot,” said William Lee Isenhour, Royale’s director of personnel and safety.

Chronic ailments caused by toxic workplace air — black lung, stonecutter’s disease, asbestosis, grinder’s rot, pneumoconiosis — incapacitate more than 200,000 workers in the United States annually. More than 40,000 Americans die prematurely each year from exposure to toxic substances at work — 10 times as many as those who die from the refinery explosions, mine collapses and other accidents that grab most of the news media attention.

Occupational illnesses and injuries like Ms. Farley’s cost the American economy roughly $250 billion per year because of medical expenses and lost productivity, according to government data analyzed by J. Paul Leigh, an economist at the University of California, Davis, more than the cost of diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Roughly 40 percent of medical expenses from workplace hazards, or about $27 billion a year, is paid by public programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

And yet the full price of this epidemic is measured not just in hospital bills and wages lost, but also in the ways, large and small, that life has changed for Ms. Farley and other sickened workers. Glue fumes robbed her of dignity and the joy of small comforts. Her favorite high heels stay in her closet because her feet no longer cooperate. She barks at her 8-year-old daughter, Allie, for hopping around their double-wide trailer because the floor’s vibrations cause intense stinging.

“I did the work,” Ms. Farley said about her years putting together furniture for America’s households. “This doesn’t seem a fair price to pay.”

Foam Country

Two industries converge in North Carolina along the nine-mile stretch of Interstate 40 between Hickory and Claremont. Foam meets furniture here. Cushions find seats.

For nearly a century, towns in these western foothills have been famous for their fine home furnishings, producing roughly half the chairs and tables sold nationwide at the industry’s peak in the 1980s. Every year, several million pounds of a flexible polyurethane foam known as slabstock arrives. It becomes the spongy filling in most of the mattresses, chairs and couches produced in the United States.

Delivered as huge yellow or pink loaves, often about four feet high and the length of a tractor-trailer, the slabstock is cut into pieces and glued into shapes by rows of workers standing in booths. They sometimes attach upholstery or add a top layer of polyester fiber to give the cushions a softer feel.

North Carolina has been especially affected by globalization and federal regulations. Shifting cultural mores and rising cigarette taxes have cleared hundreds of tobacco farms. Foreign competition has closed most of the textile mills. More than half of the furniture jobs once based here are now gone, according to federal labor data.

Still, about a thousand people spread across several dozen plants in the state work in this locally vital industry. For Ms. Farley, the job at Royale making cushions represented something rare: a chance for someone with little more than a high school diploma and an ability to stand on her feet all day to make more than $9 an hour.

Day 1 at the job brought ominous advice. Don’t dally, co-workers counseled her; managers keep track of your cushions per hour. Bring a hair dryer; it helps in warming brittle hands in winter when the plant gets frigid. Stock up on aspirin and tissues: the first to survive the headaches from the glue’s gasoline-like fumes; the second because the fumes clear the sinuses.

Asked about the conditions, Royale officials said their three plants, two here in Taylorsville and one about 15 miles away in Conover, were no worse than others in the business.

But no one denied it was dirty, bone-tiring work. During 10-hour shifts, the gluers held spray guns attached to hoses that ran to a humming compressor and 55-gallon drums filled with the glue. Once sprayed, the glue coated everything — the lights, fans, floors and electrical outlets — and hung over the workers’ cubicles like a shroud.

“It puts the fog in your head,” Ms. Farley said. By the end of a shift, the glue left some workers so dizzy that they walked as if they were drunk. At times, they did not remember driving home.

A Chemical’s Use Grows

Cushion-making companies had every reason to like nPB glues. First marketed in the late 1990s, they were inexpensive, strong, fast-drying and, best of all, unregulated.

“It’s so safe you can eat it,” glue salesmen in North Carolina told customers, according to federal researchers. Plant operators joked, “At worst, it’s a cheap high,” an official from an industry trade association recalled. Water-based glues, though safer, dried slower. And retooling a plant to use them could cost anywhere from several thousand dollars to more than $1 million, in some cases doubling a company’s gluing costs.

Finding a glue that complied with federal rules was a continuing struggle. In the early 1980s, many companies used glue with a chemical called 1,1,1-trichloroethane, or TCA. But the United States and other countries then banned it because it damages the ozone layer, and businesses switched to methylene chloride.

Nicknamed by cushion makers “methyl ethyl bad stuff,” it killed more than 30 workers a year and sickened thousands more across all industries. OSHA tightened safety limits on the chemical, so companies sought a new option. Before long, roughly a third of the cushion-making industry had switched to nPB-based glues.

For the most part, American employers are left on their own to find substitutes when federal agencies impose new rules on chemicals. But when the government forces the phasing out of one hazardous chemical, it is often replaced by another equally or more dangerous one.

From the start, government officials worried about the safety of nPB, which is also sometimes called 1-bromopropane or 1-BP.

In 1999, Adam Finkel, OSHA’s top health officer who had led the agency’s drive to phase out methylene chloride, wrote a letter warning that nPB was being used as a replacement at levels 10 to 200 times what chemical companies said was safe. Something needed to be done, he said, before the number of people exposed to the new chemical “grows from the hundreds to the tens of thousands or more.”

Some companies pulled back. Protonique SA, a Swiss circuit-board maker, banned it for its workers, who used a form of the chemical that was less toxic than that inhaled by Royale workers. “There is a weight of evidence that should sound warning bells to any thinking person,” the company said in 1999. By 2003, Atofina and Great Lakes, two large chemical companies, had decided they would no longer sell nPB.

In the six years after Mr. Finkel wrote his warning letter, federal authorities learned that more than 140 cushion workers nationwide, mostly from plants in Utah, Mississippi and North Carolina, including Royale, had been exposed to dangerous levels of the chemical, many of them sickened and unable to walk.

Cushion makers in the 30,000-employee foam industry were among the most vulnerable of all workers using nPB because they breathed it in aerosol doses. Those employed in other businesses mostly used it in other forms, which pose lower risks, according to scientists, who are finding mounting evidence that nPB is also a carcinogen.

Pinpointing the cause of a worker’s ailment is an inexact science because it is so difficult to rule out the role played by personal habits, toxins in the environment or other factors. But for nearly two decades, most chemical safety scientists have concluded that nPB can cause severe nerve damage when inhaled even at low levels.

Ms. Farley sued Royale for workers’ compensation payments. Her case, along with several other lawsuits related to glue fumes brought by other workers, has been settled.

When news of exposure problems at Royale reached officials at Mid South Adhesives, the maker of the glue that Royale used, they sent an inspector who found that Royale’s Conover plant showed levels at least 10 times what Mid South deemed safe. Mid South officials wrote to Royale to say they could “not stress enough” the need to provide better protections or to stop using their glue.

Royale officials, though, responded that even though they had added fans, had trained workers handling toxic chemicals and planned to put in a new ventilation system, problems persisted.

“We tried to use a water-base adhesive, which did not work for us,” a Royale official wrote, adding that the company saw no alternative but to stick with nPB glue.

Other companies were also reluctant to switch from nPB glues. Officials of the Franklin Corporation, a cushion plant in Houston, Miss., explained in court documents that safety was important but that nPB glues were attractive because they dried so fast that the cushions could be produced in a third of the time.

“There are people lined up out there for jobs,” said John Lyles, a vice president at Franklin, according to testimony by a plant manager in a successful lawsuit in Mississippi brought by four cushion workers who suffered severe nerve damage from the glue. “If they start dropping like flies, or something in that order, we can replace them today.”

Businesses found nPB appealing partly because the E.P.A. had given it an endorsement of sorts by adding it to a list of chemicals that do not harm the ozone layer. But an unintended effect of that action was to allow sellers of the chemical to market it as federally approved, “nonhazardous,” green and worker-friendly.

As the chemical’s popularity grew, E.P.A. officials worried about its use in spray glues, especially in cushion-making factories where the agency had determined that even with “state of the art” ventilation, “nPB-based adhesives cannot be reliably used in a manner that protects human health.”

Environmental officials figured that OSHA, pressured by the Bush administration and Republican lawmakers to be more business-friendly, would not be capable of policing the growing threat. “OSHA is tough,” E.P.A. officials said, according to notes from a November 2006 meeting on concerns about nPB. “But their budget is small, and they are not going to crack down on small businesses.”

OSHA has never set a standard establishing safety limits on workers’ exposure to nPB. The E.P.A. recommended such a limit and considered banning the nPB glues, but it has yet to finalize the plan. It determined that most cushion companies using the glue had fewer than 100 employees, which meant they were less able to absorb the cost of another regulation.

“There just wasn’t the political will,” an E.P.A. official who was part of the decision-making said on the condition of anonymity.

Improvised Remedies

A single tattered page from a 2005 workers’ compensation log summed up the emerging situation at Royale. Beneath a column headed “Injury or Illness” stretched a dozen rows, each reading “Alleged Neurological Injury” — one for each worker in the Conover plant sickened in the first three months of the year. Each missed more than 40 days of work because of the glue fumes, which were especially intense after the company moved the work stations closer together.

Thousands of additional pages of court and government documents, as well as interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees — some speaking on the condition of anonymity — present a fuller view of the conditions in the plant and how things got that way.

By 2005, Efrain Robles Avila was using a walker because he could no longer stand on his own, according to medical records. Victor Gonzales, a father of three, needed help putting on his clothes because he had lost control of his hands. Laura Garcia, who had worked for Royale for less than a year, complained of a cold numbness running from her waist to her toes. “It was like your legs didn’t receive the signal when you had to walk,” she said in court documents.

The numbness was dangerous. One worker recounted meeting a neighbor who asked why she was wearing a single red shoe. Only then did the worker realize her foot was bleeding profusely from a two-inch gash.

Inside the plant, workers improvised. Some stood on scrap pieces of foam to cushion their feet and ease the stinging sensation creeping up their legs. One, Sonia Richards, arrived with her own respirator, but a manager told her to put it away, saying it was spooking other workers. In whispers, new employees were warned to visit the bathroom whenever the fog grew thick.

“If you don’t clear your head,” a worker recalled being told, “it will clear you.”

Royale is among the industry’s most dangerous businesses, according to OSHA data. Federal officials found that it had exposed workers to dangerous levels of nPB at least a dozen times, more often than any other company. Since 2002, nearly three dozen Royale workers have been found to be breathing dangerous levels of glue fumes, federal records show.

Current and former employees say the number of workers sickened is most likely double that, since OSHA visited only periodically and turnover was high.

Some buyers of Royale cushions said they knew generally of the dangers of nPB, but expected their suppliers to take all required precautions. Lisa Hanly, vice president of Furniture Brands, which handles Broyhill and other well-known furniture, said, “Our goal is to produce high-quality product, which meets all legal and safety requirements, at an affordable price.” She said the company’s inspections focused on suppliers overseas, where regulations are weaker than in the United States. Other companies that buy from Royale declined to comment.

Royale workers became regular visitors at local health clinics, including the Clinic for People Without Health Insurance, then run by Dr. Ben Wofford.

Looking like “upright cadavers,” Dr. Wofford said, cushion workers arrived unable to stand on their own, supported under their arms by family members. They had showered and changed out of their work clothes, he said, but their breath still carried an odor he remembered from his boyhood days putting together model airplanes.

He had watched for years as his patients’ suffering worsened with the bottoming out of the state’s tobacco, textile and furniture industries. When people are out of work, he explained in an interview in his office above the pharmacy in Newton, N.C., a diabetic ulcer that would normally cost a toe takes a leg. Their nonfatal hernia bleeds them to death.

“You kill jobs,” Dr. Wofford said, “you kill patients.”

Reluctantly, he wrote a letter in 2005 alerting OSHA about problems at Royale. One worker was in especially bad shape, he wrote: “Indeed he may die as a result of his exposure.”

But Dr. Wofford also urged OSHA not to overreact. “I would hate to see this plant’s multiple shortcomings result in its being shut down,” he wrote, warning of jobs that could be lost. “Many are my patients and are already in dire straits economically.”

Referring to one woman who was the sole support for herself and three children, he wrote, “She too is unlikely to find work if the effects of the neurotoxin are irreversible, as my neurological consultant thinks they may be.”

Over the years, officials with Royale, which employs about 100 workers and had around $7.5 million in sales in 2011, have repeatedly said they have done all they can to make their three plants safe. They frequently took steps to improve the air in their plants, but their actions were also sometimes counterproductive — after improving ventilation, they failed to change filters, for example, or covered vents with plastic in the winter to keep out cold air, according to OSHA documents.

In a recent interview, Mr. Isenhour, Royale’s safety director, said the company never meant to harm anyone and initially did not realize the hazards of nPB. Royale has continued using nPB glues, he added, because alternatives are ineffective or risky.

Glues that use acetone, for example, are popular but highly flammable, he said. Converting the Royale plant to meet federal rules on fire safety would entail replacing the glue-spraying booths with metal walls, installing sprinklers and explosion-proof lighting and retraining workers, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, he added.

In 2005, when seven workers became seriously ill at one plant, Mr. Isenhour said, Royale had to lay off 40 people, close the facility and spend $50,000 to move operations to another site and upgrade the ventilation there. OSHA found high levels of fumes in subsequent years because no one informed the company that fans and filters needed cleaning for ventilation to work properly, he said.

If the company switched to a more expensive glue, he said, he would have to raise the price of each cushion, and the furniture makers Royale supplies would contract with Chinese competitors instead.

“We are trying to keep jobs in America,” he said. “But that’s expensive.”

Both government officials and employers weigh the costs and benefits of protective measures. Many studies show that investing in workplace safety saves money in the long run, but economists say that does not prove true in every case. This, of course, raises the most difficult calculus of all: comparing the worth of a dangerous job versus no job at all. How should companies and regulators put a dollar value on workers’ quality of life — indeed, on their very lives?

To date, Royale has paid nearly a half-million dollars — in court settlements, required upgrades and less than $20,000 in OSHA fines related to glue fumes. Those costs — and the harm to workers — accumulated in slow motion. Cushion making is a boom-bust business, subject to the swings of big orders from furniture companies. Royale and others in the industry frequently use transient, nonunion and illegal immigrant laborers, according to workers and court documents, who are less likely to report hazards and document symptoms.

As fast as workers were getting sick, managers found replacements.

“Folks was limping in and getting worse,” said Dewaun Teague, a former Royale manager. “Then they would be let go, and we would hire more.”

Mr. Teague said Royale was a good company to work for in many ways. The owner, Clyde Goble, looked you in the eye when he shook your hand and remembered your children’s birthdays, Mr. Teague said, adding, “This was family.”

Complain. Inspect. Repeat.

After receiving an anonymous complaint about glue fumes, Beverly Stone, an OSHA inspector, visited a Royale foam cushion plant in Taylorsville in May 2011. She toured the facility, tested the air and then filed a lengthy report.

“Ventilation did not appear to be working properly,” it said, adding that at least 16 workers were breathing dangerous levels of glue fumes.

Worrisome enough on their own, Ms. Stone’s findings were even more alarming because they were so similar to what OSHA documented in 1996, 2000, 2002 and 2005.

Again and again, Royale workers got sick and contacted OSHA. Inspectors came and went. Little changed.

Company officials were told to ventilate to the outside. They bought pedestal fans instead, and when OSHA inspectors returned, they found the fans turned off or malfunctioning. OSHA demanded respirators that would have cost the company $18. Managers instead handed out 90-cent dust masks — the type inspectors had told them were useless in blocking vapors.

The agency advised the company to stop using nPB-based glues. And yet, each time inspectors showed up, they found more workers exposed to the chemical and at levels higher than what the glue companies were saying was safe.

Back and forth it went, as workers fell victim not just to toxic air but also to a federal agency’s inability to enforce its requirements.

While agency inspectors consistently showed up within a day of receiving worker complaints, records show, they often did with one hand what they undid with the other. Sometimes they failed to levy fines because they did not believe they had the authority. Other times they undermined their own leverage by slashing the size of penalties in hopes of promoting cooperation from the company.

After each visit, the agency suggested abatements but never did follow-up air tests and appeared again only when sick workers complained.

For its part, the company shuffled workers among its three plants in the frustrated hope that one of the sites might have better air flow. But the constant movement of these workers from plant to plant also made repeat problems look to regulators like isolated cases.

In early 2011, when Royale officials realized that they could not fix the ventilation at the Taylorsville plant where Ms. Farley worked, they moved her and a half-dozen other workers to the other Taylorsville site. Ms. Farley’s symptoms grew worse there; the ventilation problems had been identified by OSHA in 2002 but never corrected.

If inspections are supposed to force companies to rectify problems and avoid future ones, that 2002 inspection was a failure. “Not able to require the employer to implement engineering controls,” the OSHA official wrote at the time, adding that the agency could not levy fines or mandate respirators because there was no federal safety standard involving nPB.

That was a legal judgment call, one that many workplace safety experts say illustrates OSHA’s unwillingness to exert its full authority. Though the agency has the legal means to force companies to protect workers better from certain chemicals even when there is no specific exposure level established by the agency as safe, OSHA rarely invokes this power for fear of sapping limited resources if the matter ends up in court.

“We do the best we can,” said Kevin Beauregard, an assistant deputy OSHA commissioner in North Carolina, which is among 25 states deputized by the federal government to oversee worker safety programs. He said that before his office could act in such instances, it must first prove that workers were exposed to a substance whose hazards were recognized in the industry and that the exposure was avoidable.

OSHA also rates health hazards as a lower priority than safety threats. In 1996, for instance, inspectors discovered that a machine part hit a Royale worker in the groin. The agency threatened to fine the company a total of $120,000, adding $5,000 to the fine for each day that the company failed to repair the machine. But when nPB levels remained high during five visits between 2002 and 2011, the agency never increased the penalties. The proposed total for all of Royale’s health-related fines was $20,800, an amount the agency later lowered.

Partly, the emphasis on safety enforcement is a numbers game. OSHA’s performance is often measured by lawmakers, advocacy groups and the news media based on how many inspections it does in a year; an inspector can do five times as many safety inspections in the time it typically takes to do one focused on health, where the issues may be less clear-cut. And the agency tends to face less public pressure about health enforcement, because the harm done by these sorts of hazards typically does not show up for years.

Furthermore, while the number of inspectors has grown under the Obama administration, OSHA still has just 2,400 responsible for overseeing roughly eight million work sites — roughly one inspector per 60,000 workers, a ratio that has not changed since 1970. The federal budget for protecting workers is less than half of that set aside for protecting fish and wildlife.

Mr. Michaels, whose tenure leading OSHA since December 2009 has been characterized by more aggressive enforcement than that of his most recent predecessors, cites a deeper problem: the small amount that OSHA can levy in fines. The maximum penalty for a violation that causes a “substantial probability of death — or serious physical harm” is $7,000. The highest fine for a willful and repeated violation is $70,000.

This, Mr. Michaels said, pales in comparison with fines of up to $130,000 that the Department of Agriculture can levy if a dairy company refuses to pay fees that help the federal government advertise milk products, or the $325,000 that the Federal Communications Commission can fine a TV or radio station for indecent content.

“If the cost of compliance to our rules outweighs the penalties for breaking them, companies just take a ‘catch me if you can’ approach to worker safety and health,” he said. And serious violations of the rules should not be misdemeanors, he said, but felonies, much like insider trading, tax crimes and antitrust violations.

But Jeff Ruch, the director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a public health advocacy organization, said that, on average, OSHA now conducts health inspections and collects air samples less than half as often as it did under the Reagan administration.

“You can’t hit someone with a fine,” Mr. Ruch said, “if you aren’t on site looking to find the violations.”

Hard Calculus

As her truck crawled down a bumpy dirt road, Ms. Farley said she needed to go slowly because she could not afford to replace her duct-taped bumper if it fell off. Between money from breeding her four Rottweilers, food stamp assistance and the occasional help from her ex-husband or the local food bank, her finances leave little room for error.

She stopped in a field dotted with narrow white trailers to pick up Cosondra Little, another former Royale worker, who limped as she approached. Ms. Little lives with her 24-year-old daughter, SoSonia, who is unemployed. What fresh tomatoes, collard greens and other vegetables the two eat come mostly from scavenging on nearby fields when farmers allow it. This has been the case, Ms. Little said, ever since she lost her job at the cushion plant in May 2003.

“My feet started to throw a fit,” she said. First went her health insurance, then money for SoSonia’s college tuition, then their savings, and finally the car.

“You try getting a job around here without a car,” Ms. Little said, riding along a wooded stretch of Highway 16 just south of Taylorsville.

Soon the two women arrived at Martha Cardenas’s house, where they were joined by two others, one a former cushion maker, the other a current one. They had gathered to explain that Royale is not unique.

After small talk about Ms. Cardenas’s empanadas, the women stacked their medical records on the table. Different plants, different doctors, same glue. Broken lives reduced to physicians’ scribbles. “Staggered gait,” “numb hands and feet,” “spinal pain.”

Usually the same medical advice, too: find a different job; stop working with the glue. It “has been clearly documented as a cause of” nerve damage, Ms. Little’s doctor wrote to her boss about nPB.

But other jobs are hard to come by. And that is why everyone has wanted to keep Royale in business. “Now none of us are working,” Ms. Farley said. In Dr. Wofford’s hesitant whistle-blower letter to OSHA, in a $50,000 loan that county officials gave to Royale, in OSHA’s formula for lowering fines, there were vexing calculations seeking to strike the right balance between protecting jobs and safeguarding those holding them.

In Ms. Cardenas’s house, the women were doing some math of their own. One tried to tally how many hours she had spent in the unemployment office. Another added up her credit card debt and counted her doctors’ visits. But mostly the women listed the subtler costs of their injuries, like the pounds gained from immobility or the addiction concerns with pain pills.

As the women stood up to leave, several grabbed the wall for balance. Ms. Farley added a parting thought.

“And all the while everyone thinks you’re just faking,” she said. The women agree that this is the worst part."

That can make it hard for people seeking to correct errors to find the keepers of their marketing profiles.

I was ruminating on that problem in Washington on Wednesday, when I paid a visit to Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat, who has made consumer privacy one of his signature issues.

Americans, he says, should be allowed “to be left alone.”

In part, this belief stems from his own nature. He describes himself as an introvert, a person who would rather stay at home and listen to Bach fugues than attend Beltway shindigs. But mainly, he just thinks that privacy is a fundamental American right.

“The principles are remarkably simple,” Mr. Rockefeller said, comfortably installed in an armchair in his Senate office. Americans, he continued, should have the right to decide what kind of marketing material is sent to them and what other people know about them: “People have the right to be private insofar as it’s possible in the modern world.”

Earlier that day, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, of which Mr. Rockefeller is chairman, had convened a hearing on the status of an online privacy mechanism for consumers called Do Not Track. The idea behind it is that people should be able to turn on settings in their Internet browsers to signal advertisers, data brokers and other third-party operators not to collect information about their activities across the Web. Advertising networks and other entities would theoretically honor those don’t-track-me flags by restricting the amount of information they collected.

But years after the Federal Trade Commission recommended that advertisers adopt such a browser-based system, consumer advocates and ad industry groups still seem at odds over fundamental issues — including the very definition of Do Not Track. In an attempt to pressure the ad industry to get with the program, the Senate committee held a hearing.

“I want to get to the bottom of this controversy,” Mr. Rockefeller said in his opening statement. “I want the witnesses to publicly explain exactly what they believe has gone wrong, and what they are prepared to offer to make Do Not Track a reality for consumers.”

Yet he acknowledges that this kind of privacy option for online consumers, even if it eventually goes into effect, does not address a larger issue: the thousands of details that third-party data gatherers, who typically don’t interact directly with consumers, have already amassed about a majority of adults in the United States. For instance, there is no federal law that requires such companies to allow consumers to have access to and correct marketing data that’s been compiled about them. That is partly why the Senate committee opened an investigation last year into the practices of leading data brokers.

Mr. Rockefeller says the investigation is continuing.

So I decided — after asking permission from the friend who received the M.S. flier — to see if I could find out how erroneous information about her health status moved from one company to another. It wasn’t an obvious trajectory.

Erin-Marie Beals, a spokeswoman for EMD Serono, told me that MS LifeLines sends marketing materials only to people who have indicated an interest in multiple sclerosis and have provided their contact information either directly to MS LifeLines or through other programs, like online surveys or subscriptions. Ms. Beals pointed me to the firm that had provided my friend’s information — the KBM Group, a marketing company that specializes in consumer data and analytics.

Ultimately, Barbara Palmer, the senior vice president for marketing at the KBM Group, told me that her firm had obtained the information from a survey company whose online questionnaire my friend had filled out in 2010. That survey, Ms. Palmer said, asked general questions, including some about health interests. She said it also contained a specific disclosure: “By completing the health-related questions on the survey, you are consenting to the use of this information for direct marketing purposes.”

Ms. Palmer added that her company honored people’s requests to opt out of its file. The Direct Marketing Association also provides a program for consumers who want to opt out of receiving all kinds of pitches by mail.

At the end of the day, information about my friend ended up in the hands of at least two companies she had never heard of, let alone interacted with. Other companies may also have obtained the data.

The proliferation of intimate details about people’s health, financial or academic status — even when the data are correct — particularly troubles Senator Rockefeller. Although laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act limit the use of people’s credit and medical records, data brokers are often able to compile consumers’ financial and health information through other means.

“One of the things that really disturbs me in privacy, or the lack of it, is the way that data brokers can go in and buy all your health records, your financial records — they can get it one way or another,” Mr. Rockefeller said during the hearing. “What is of you, they can have.”

He added: “We are talking about a very, very large industry here which can decide to do that and which is doing that.”"

He soon recognized that he didn’t know what to do with it. “I needed instruction,” he told me in an interview conducted — perhaps surprisingly — by e-mail. “The technology of the Internet, cell and iPhones was like a foreign language.”

Mr. Phillips then attended one of the first classes offered by OATS, a New York City nonprofit (the acronym stands for Older Adults Technology Services) that provides free tech training for seniors.

Despite serious hearing loss from an injury in the Korean War, Mr. Phillips learned his way around his desktop, went on to more advanced OATS classes and now, at 83, uses his computer (his third) to blog, write stories and theater pieces, and to communicate with friends and family from England to California. It’s become “the most important activity and creative outlet in my life,” he wrote.

Would that more older adults could follow suit. A few weeks back, I noted that only 54 percent of Americans over age 65 have access to the Internet, according to Pew Research studies. Among those 77 and older, the proportion drops to about a third.

In an era when everything, from personal health records to nursing home quality ratings, is moving online, when the best way to stay in touch with grandchildren may involve texting, this amounts to slow progress. The tech analyst Laurie Orlov of the Aging in Place Technology Watch blog has called for a national campaign to bring 100 percent of seniors online.

Teaching skills only addresses part of the problem, of course; the costs of devices and of Internet service also keep older people offline, and so do physical limitations or cognitive impairment.

Still, learning the technology is key. As Mr. Phillips pointed out, “the Internet was a whole new world for me.” Everyone exploring a new world needs a guide.

Though lots of communities offer computer classes for older adults, the response has been mostly local and small-scale. But since my previous post brought lots of comments from frustrated adult children, I thought I’d pass along some time-tested national and about-to-be-national programs. Researchers have learned a fair amount about the ways seniors learn and have documented that computer and Internet training works well when it incorporates those findings.

First, thanks to reader D. Solomon from San Jose for reminding us about Senior Net, a player in this game since 1986. Supported in part by tech giants like Adobe, Microsoft and IBM, as well as local governments and foundations, Senior Net has established about 50 learning centers around the country, a laudable accomplishment. (Look here to see if there’s one near you or your parent.) Still, it’s not enough. For instance, there’s one center in all of New Jersey, my state, and none in several other states.

The Connections program, developed by the nonprofit Oasis Institute, fills in some of those gaps. Bolstered by grants from AT&T, it offers classes in 23 metro areas — including suburban Pittsburgh, where volunteer Harvey Schoenman, 72 and retired after a long tech career, teaches his peers at the Community Library of Castle Shannon.

His students, Mr. Schoenman finds, often suffer from computer anxiety. (Oh, how I remember.) “But they’ve heard about Facebook; their grandchildren are on it, and they want to be a part of it,” he told me. “They want to learn how to get junk out of their houses and sell it on eBay. They want to be better able to function in today’s world.”

Connections’ curriculum includes more than 30 courses ranging from basics to digital photography and online job-hunting. It keeps classes small and of manageable length (two hours, with a break in between), with lots of repetition and hands-on practice. Workbooks are tailored to seniors — large fonts, multiple illustrations.

That approach seems to pay off. After comparing a small sample of Connections students with a control group, researchers a the University of Miami found that after completing introductory courses, older adults were significantly more comfortable with and knowledgeable about computers and the Internet, and more likely to use them.

In Manhattan, OATS just opened a snazzy 2,700-foot Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea, the country’s first tech center specifically for those over 60.

OATS also teaches a range of senior-tailored courses in 70 locations across the city (libraries, public schools, senior centers and senior housing developments). Now it’s thinking big, planning to tackle other cities.

“We have a lot of infrastructure that wasn’t there before,” said the executive director, Tom Kamber, noting that federal stimulus funds had helped build 3,000 computer labs around the country. “We’re right on the cusp of creating a powerful national program that will reach hundreds of thousands of seniors a year.”

Make it so. When seniors succeed in taming technology, it can make an enormous difference in their lives.

Ask Muriel Beach, an 85-year-old OATS alumna. In her career as a labor economist, she had used electric typewriters, so computers were terra incognita.

Not any more. “These classes provide a doorway for seniors to the wider world,” she told me. She sent that e-mail to me from her iPad."

Professor Sweeney says: “We would like to see people have access to all of the data that they produce.”

In fact, a few companies are challenging the norm of corporate data hoarding by actually sharing some information with the customers who generate it — and offering tools to put it to use. It’s a small but provocative trend in the United States, where only a handful of industries, like health care and credit, are required by federal law to provide people with access to their records.

Last year, San Diego Gas and Electric, a utility, introduced an online energy management program in which customers can view their electricity use in monthly, daily or hourly increments. There is even a practical benefit: customers can earn credits by reducing energy consumption during peak hours.

About one-quarter of the company’s 1.2 million residential customers have tried the program, says Caroline Winn, the company’s vice president for customer services. Newer features, she says, allow customers to download their own use files. Or they can choose to give permission for the utility to share their records directly with a handful of apps that can analyze the data and suggest ways to reduce energy consumption.

“The customer owns their data,” Ms. Winn says. “Whether they want to use our app or somebody else’s, we want to make sure we are facilitating that.”

(Con Ed in New York also offers customers reduced pricing if they use electricity during off-peak hours. But the program requires the installation of a special meter.)

People might feel more comfortable about being subject to data-mining if companies did a better job of demonstrating a direct benefit to them, argues Jules Polonetsky, director of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry financed research organization in Washington. One model for this, he says, is the product recommendation engine at Amazon, which lets customers view their purchase histories and excise one-off items they bought for friends that might not represent their own personal tastes.

“They are providing transparency as a feature,” Mr. Polonetsky says. “I can tweak their algorithm in a way that is mutually useful.” (Amazon is one of the sponsors of his organization.)

Even so, companies rarely offer customers more than a cropped snapshot of their activities.

Right now, for example, fitness enthusiasts who use blood pressure monitors, calorie calculators and movement sensors typically can’t collate the data for a unified view of their wellness, Doc Searls, a technology writer who has experienced this kind of problem himself, told me. If people could easily integrate their data, he wrote in a recent blog post, they might be able to correlate weight loss to a particular workout routine or diet. Those companies that do allow customers to export their files and integrate their data elsewhere, he says, have a market advantage over companies that are data misers.

“Stock data, bank data, and bond data are all more valuable when they are looked at together,” says Mr. Searls, the author of “The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge.” “If I have a choice between apps and one of them shares the data that I can use more easily, I am going to choose that one.”

INTEL, for instance, recently introduced a “data economy” project, intended to encourage companies to think of consumers as participants in the information economy, and not just as data-harvesting opportunities. The venture includes a site called WeTheData.com, which looks at current obstacles to information sharing.

Ken Anderson, a senior research scientist at Intel Labs who oversees the project, compares corporate data-hoarding today to a faulty mind-set of the fast-food industry in the early 1980s. Back then, he says, fast-food chains thought that they should open outlets only at a good distance from their competitors. But when food courts in malls became popular, he says, those restaurant chains realized that they benefited from shared retail space.

“If you put it all in one place, you get more business,” says Mr. Anderson, a cultural anthropologist who studies how people interact with technology.

The same goes for consumer data. He envisions an online answer to food courts — an information smorgasbord where consumers could browse their own records. “We are trying to show companies the value of opening data up” he says, “and having them be more communal in nature.”"

The word “data” connotes fixed numbers inside hard grids of information, and as a result, it is easily mistaken for fact. But including bad product introductions and wars, we have many examples of bad data causing big mistakes.

Big Data raises bigger issues. The term suggests assembling many facts to create greater, previously unseen truths. It suggests the certainty of math.

That promise of certainty has been a hallmark of the technology industry for decades. With Big Data, however, there are even more hazards, some human and some inherent in the technology.

Kate Crawford, a researcher at Microsoft Research, calls the problem “Big Data fundamentalism — the idea with larger data sets, we get closer to objective truth.” Speaking at a conference in Berkeley, Calif., on Thursday, she identified what she calls “six myths of Big Data.”

Myth 1: Big Data is New

In 1997, there was a paper that discussed the difficulty of visualizing Big Data, and in 1999, a paper that discussed the problems of gaining insight from the numbers in Big Data. That indicates that two prominent issues today in Big Data, display and insight, had been around for awhile.

“But now it’s reaching us in new ways,” because of the scale and prevalence of Big Data, Ms. Crawford said. That also means it is a widespread social phenomenon, like mobile phones were in the 1990s, that “generates a lot of comment, and then disappears into the background, as something that’s just part of life.”

Myth 2: Big Data Is Objective

Over 20 million Twitter messages about Hurricane Sandy were posted last year. That may seem sufficient for a picture of whom the storm affected. However, the 16 percent of Americans on Twitter tend to be younger, more urban and more affluent than the norm. “Very few tweets came out of Breezy Point, or the Rockaways,” Ms. Crawford said. “These were very privileged urban stories.” And some people, privileged or otherwise, put information like their home addresses on Twitter in an effort to seek aid. That sensitive information is still out there, even though the threat is gone.

That means that most data sets, particularly where people are concerned, need references to the context in which they were created.

Myth 3: Big Data Doesn’t Discriminate

“Big Data is neither color blind nor gender blind,” Ms. Crawford said. “We can see how it is used in marketing to segment people.” Facebook timelines, stripped of data like names, can still be used to determine a person’s ethnicity with 95 percent accuracy, she said. Information like sexual orientation among males is also relatively easy to identify. (Women are tougher to pinpoint.) That information can be used to determine what kind of advertisements, for example, that people receive.

It’s important to remember that whenever people start creating data sets, these become fallible human tools. “Data is something we create, but it’s also something we imagine,” Ms. Crawford said.

Myth 4: Big Data Makes Cities Smart

“It’s only as good as the people using it,” Ms. Crawford said. Many of the sensors that track people as they manage their urban lives come from high-end smartphones, or cars with the latest GPS systems. “Devices are becoming the proxies for public needs,” she said, “but there won’t be a moment where everyone has access to the same technology.” In addition, moving cities toward digital initiatives like predictive policing, or creating systems where people are seen, whether they like it or not, can promote lots of tension between individuals and their governments.

Sorry, IBM. Take that, Cisco. That goes for you, too, Microsoft, Ms. Crawford’s employer. All these big technology companies have Smart Cities initiatives.

Myth 5: Big Data Is Anonymous

A study published in Nature last March looked at 1.5 million phone records that had personally identifying information removed. It found that just four data points of when and where a call was made could identify 95 percent of individuals. “With just two, you can identify 50 percent of them,” Ms. Crawford said. “With a fingerprint, you need 12 data points to identify somebody.” Likewise, smart grids can spot when your friends come over. Search engine queries can yield health data that would be protected if it came up in a doctor’s office.

Myth 6: You Can Opt Out

Last December, Instagram, the photo-sharing site, changed its terms of service to allow it to share customer’s photos more broadly, even use images in ads. What it didn’t have was a paid option, in which a person could, for a fee, not be part of that. Even if that option existed, Ms. Crawford said, this would imply a two-tier system — people who could afford to control their data and those who could not. “Besides,” she said, given the ways that information can be obtained in these big systems, “what are the chances that your personal information will never be used?”

Before Big Data disappears into the background as another fact of life, Ms. Crawford said, “We need to think about how we will navigate these systems. Not just individually, but as a society.”"

The revelations this month about government surveillance programs that collect the phone logs of people in the United States and can monitor e-mail traffic abroad are provoking a larger debate on the rights of consumers to control the collection and sharing of data about them.

One industry under the microscope is data brokerages. These are business-to-business companies that collect thousands of details — like the shopping habits, vacation preferences, estimated income, ethnicity, hobbies, predilections for gambling or smoking and health concerns — about millions of consumers, the better to help marketers identify potential new customers as well as maintain their already loyal clients.

Although some of these companies do permit people to opt out of their marketing databases, most do not have systems to allow consumers to see records held about them and correct possible errors. Because of this lack of transparency, federal regulators and privacy advocates have long warned about the potential for such data-mining to discriminate against consumers based on sensitive details like financial or health information.

Now Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, has proposed an industrywide initiative to give consumers access to their own records held by data brokers. She envisions an online portal where data brokers would describe their data collection practices and their consumer access policies.

Ms. Brill has come up with a handy nickname for her proposed effort: “Reclaim Your Name.”

“Reclaim Your Name would empower the consumer to find out how brokers are collecting and using data; give her access to information that data brokers have amassed about her; allow her to opt-out if she learns a data broker is selling her information for marketing purposes and provide her the opportunity to correct errors in information used for substantive decisions – like credit, insurance, employment, and other benefits,” Ms. Brill said in a speech on Wednesday morning at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in Washington.

Here’s a link to the full text of Ms. Brill’s speech.

Over the last year, legislators in the House and Senate have separately opened investigations into the practices of some leading data brokers with the goal of increasing oversight of the industry. Participation in a voluntary “Reclaim Your Name” program of the kind Ms. Brill proposed might help the industry mitigate government efforts toward greater regulation."

Todd Park, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, serves as President Obama’s chief technology officer. His role has taken on heightened importance after several recent developments, including the implementation of the new health care law, efforts to reduce the backlog in Department of Veterans Affairs claims processing, and privacy issues raised by disclosures about data collection by the National Security Agency. Mr. Park spoke with John Harwood of The Times and CNBC at the White House as Mr. Obama publicly challenged his administration to improve the government’s innovation and efficiency in his second term.

What follows is a condensed, edited account of their conversation.

Q.

Government has a reputation for being clunky, slow, inefficient. What do you think you have been able to accomplish?

A.

There are phenomenal people harnessing the power of tech and innovation to help government work better, cost less and help grow the economy. For example, in the recent Hurricane Sandy and Oklahoma tornado response, FEMA has harnessed tech in all kinds of ways to deliver better results. To get housing to folks, you used to rely exclusively on the ground inspectors, now we can use satellite and analytics to figure out what areas need help and get help faster. In addition, a majority of folks who registered for disaster aid post-Sandy were able to do so via mobile phone or Internet. Even when folks didn’t have access, FEMA inspectors came back with iPads to actually register them for aid.

Another example: I was recently traveling with the president to Austin, where he launched a new executive order that opens up tons of government data — everything from health and medicine and science to safety and more — as machine-readable, free fuel for entrepreneurs to tap to create new companies and jobs. The president’s attitude is, this is America’s data. All kinds of entrepreneurs are picking up that data to help grow the economy.

Q.

Possibly the biggest thing the government has going right now is trying to implement the health care law. The administration announced a delay in the employer mandate; they couldn’t get it done in time. What does that tell you about the limits of technology in making it work more rapidly and efficiently?

A.

The president is really focused on implementing the law very well. Business expressed concern that there are issues to be worked through, so it was a sensible thing to do to say, “O.K., let’s work through those issues.” Oct. 1, we’ll be bringing live the new health marketplaces. Things are on track to make that happen. There is a whole team at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services working incredibly hard, night and day, on bringing out these new health marketplaces. We have actually done a huge amount of user testing on it to make sure the Web site is as user-friendly as possible. The prototypes are incredibly impressive.

Q.

No doubt they’ll be up and running in October?

A.

They’ll be up and running Oct. 1.

Q.

Let me ask you about the culture of Washington. It has a reputation as being the opposite of the Silicon Valley culture in terms of agility and decision-making, flexibility, innovation. What have you found?

A.

I have actually found a lot more similarities than you might expect. Whenever the president gives us a mission to harness tech innovation and get something done for the American people, in terms of growing the economy and improving health care, we go find the folks across government who have been dreaming about that for a really long time. They’re out there, they’re incredibly talented innovators. We team them together into what we call a virtual start-up that’s running inside the government, to move Silicon Valley speed to get stuff done. When you have the air cover like President Obama, who is deeply passionate about harnessing innovation and tech, it is possible for these focused teams to get a lot done in a short period of time. It’s hard to actually build anything new, but it turns out if you apply a lot of the same techniques that make Silicon Valley companies successful to internally change parts of the government, they definitely work.

Q.

Talk about how those virtual start-ups work, and how many are there?

A.

The way they operate is modeled on a philosophy called “lean start-up,” which was popularized recently by Eric Ries. You want to build small, interdisciplinary, agile teams that have strategy, policy, ops and tech all represented in one team, all working to solve one problem. Secondly, there’s an emphasis on rapid prototype. You don’t think aircraft carrier, you think rowboat — the smallest possible thing I can deliver to my actual customer as early as possible, so they can actually start getting their engagement. The third principle is rapid iteration — iterate that product at high speeds with versions released every few days or every few weeks, instead of every few months or years, so you maximize the learning. So from the ground up, you eventually get to a real understanding of what the customer wanted and how to create something that delivers that. So that’s the model that we’ve been adopting.

There are about 15 or so that I personally oversee. But this is actually a model that’s been cloned across the government. The key is that we have an idea, we find the three or five people initially that had the idea a long time ago or had a similar idea across the government, put them together in this lean start-up team, liberate them to actually operate, give them the air coverage to do so, and they rock ’n’ roll from there.

Q.

One of the innovations the president is going to talk about is something called Blue Button at the Department of Veterans Affairs to help people get their medical records quickly. The department has gotten a reputation for the very slow process of handling disability claims, and it has gotten mocked for stacks of paper records. So why shouldn’t the average person say, “Great, Blue Button is fantastic, but you have such a bigger problem than that and you aren’t making much headway?”

A.

The backlog issue, as you know, is one that the administration inherited. The administration, on top of that, passed a whole set of rules that expand eligibility and increase the number of claims. There is an unprecedented, governmentwide effort that is pretty amazing to take that problem out, to take the whole backlog problem out — to apply technology and process change. We’re actually beginning to see the progress of the backlog beginning to come down at a growing clip, and we think we’re going to be able to meet our goals there. The president has made it super clear that this is a top, major priority. There’s a huge team, a cross-agency team, a cross-government team that’s actually working very hard at this complex problem and taking it out.

Q.

You did consulting for Booz Allen Hamilton, the firm that employed the National Security Agency leaker Edward J. Snowden. What is your concern in regard to privacy with government technology and the centralization of information?

A.

It’s incredibly important to protect personal privacy, and it’s something that the administration has been championing from the very beginning, advocating for consumer privacy bill of rights and making sure we build privacy protections into the Affordable Care Act and lots of different venues of activity. I think a lot has been accomplished there. I think it’s important to stay abreast of the continuing trends, and to make sure that we are tracking with those trends and ensuring that consumer privacy is protected everywhere possible.

Q.

What’s a reasonable way of looking at the success of the open-data policy that the president implemented? How quickly will we see results from that?

A.

That’s something actually that we’ve been working on since the president’s first day in office, when he submitted his open-government memorandum. There’s over 75,000 data sets on data.gov already, everything from daily hospital charges for different procedures across the country, to credit card complaints, account affordability, weather, climate, and so forth. So there’s a bunch of data that’s already been out there, and a bunch of data that has been downloaded and used by companies like Opower, which is a start-up that uses government energy trends and weather data to help consumers save money on their energy bills. Companies like iTriage, which was started a couple of years ago from a couple of emergency room doctors from Denver, that used downloaded data from the Department of Health and Human Services to help you use on a mobile app, based on what’s wrong with you, to get the best local doctors and hospitals to help you. What the executive order does is it says, going forward as a new default, all new or modernized government resources should be made open and machine-readable while protecting privacy and national security, which turbocharges the number of data sets on data.gov, and therefore turbocharges the new company creation and job creation that results.

Q.

Do you feel, as a Silicon Valley guy that has started companies, like a fish out of water in Washington?

A.

A lot of people ask me that question, a lot of my friends back home. It’s been the most amazing entrepreneurial experience I’ve ever had. The opportunity you have here to work with teams that are making changes happen at scale is quite extraordinary. The impact you can have is mass times velocity. If you take an opportunity like this, with the scale of opportunity for change that it has, and combine it with the ability to do lean start-up with air cover of the president to make change happen rapidly, that mass times velocity equation is going to have an impact.

Q.

I thought Washington was all mass and no velocity.

A.

It’s interesting. It turns out that it can have velocity on innovation ambitions, if you have a president that cares about that.

But the inner workings of this surveillance economy remain largely opaque to the public despite the recent revelations of widespread government data-mining of people’s phone and e-mail records.

Now a group of Web developers in Austria has introduced an online game called Data Dealer that aims to make the business of consumer profiling more transparent. The animated game encourages players to amass and sell fictional profiles containing details like the names, birth dates, weight, height, shopping and dietary habits of imaginary consumers.

The idea behind this cartoon data collection ecosystem is to give players a visceral sense of the widespread trade in personal data, says Wolfie Christl, a co-creator of the game.

“If you tell people they should be a bit careful, nobody listens. It’s boring,” said Mr. Christl, 36, who lives in Vienna. The game, he said, is intended to help people “understand a few things – what kind of personal data exists, which attributes are collected, who is collecting this data, why and what they are using it for.”

In Data Dealer, each player starts out with an avatar of a database, a gray anthropomorphic vault containing more than a million profiles and a budget of $5,000.

Players can buy additional profiles from a variety of sources like a dating Web site, a sweepstakes company – or even a disgruntled nurse named Mildred who is selling access to her hospital’s patient database.

Players can also earn money by selling their profiles to a fictional large employer called “Star Mart,” a health insurance company or an imaginary government entity referred to as “Central Security Agency.”

Each vendor lists the consumer details it has to sell.

The fictional dating site, for example, is selling the relationship status, sexual orientation and political attitudes of its members, along with their birth dates, genders, phone numbers and e-mail address. The cost to the player: $150 for 8,000 profiles.

Although hypothetical members of the dating site may think they are anonymous, the game suggests that data dealers could use such disparate details to connect people’s dating profiles to their real names.

“For the chance to find their soul mate, lonely souls will pour out their hearts to you and let you in on their deepest secrets,” the game says. “Once you line up e-mail addresses and pseudonyms with the real names, things start to get interesting.”

Data dealer also explains to players the value of different types of information.

Of e-mail addresses, for instance, the game says: “once you know someone’s e-mail address, you can pinpoint them anywhere, no matter which nickname or pseudonym they use. In addition, e-mail addresses can be sold quite profitably for marketing purposes.”

Although the first version of Data Dealer is meant only for individual players, the game’s developers are raising money on Kickstarter this week to finance an upgraded version that will let people play against one another – and hack each others’ databases.

Mr. Christl says he hoped the game inspired people to demand more control over the information collected and disseminated about them.

“I think at the moment all this data is being controlled by big companies and by government institutions and not by people themselves,” Mr. Christl says. “We need a self-determined usage of personal data in the future. Some changes are needed to achieve that.”

Although Data Dealer is only a game, the timing of its Kickstarter campaign seems fortuitous. Offline, federal regulators have been urging real data dealers to make their practices more transparent.

A few weeks ago, for instance, Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, proposed that data brokers — companies that gather and analyze information from multiple sources about millions of consumers — give the public more access to and control over details collected about them.

“Data brokers should develop online tools so consumers could see the information multiple companies have about them,” says, Ms. Brill. The name of her initiative: “Reclaim Your Name.”"
152,1703,2013-07-26T00:00:00Z,article,"Under Code, Apps Would Disclose Collection of Data",51f1cae438f0d8431a75b9d9,"subject:Mobile Applications, subject:Consumer Protection, subject:Data-Mining and Database Marketing, organizations:Application Developers Alliance, organizations:National Telecommunications and Information Administration",Business,0.0,None,Some app developers and consumer advocates have agreed to test a voluntary code that would require participating developers to tell consumers whether their apps are collecting personal information.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/technology/under-code-apps-would-disclose-collection-of-data.html,788,Some app developers and consumer advocates have agreed to test a voluntary code that would require participating developers to tell consumers whether their apps are collecting personal information.,"“It’s a victory for common sense,” said Tim Sparapani, vice president for law, policy and government relations at the Application Developers Alliance, a group representing more than 100 companies and 20,000 individual developers.

But other participants in the negotiations said the notices would do little to give individual consumers more insight into or control over the vast piles of information about them that online entities collect and analyze. The notices would display only a limited list of data collection categories, they say, and would not allow consumers to opt out of data-mining or even see the records companies had amassed about them.

“A very modest slice of privacy was put forward,” for the groups to tackle, said Susan Grant, the director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America, a research and advocacy organization representing about 300 consumer groups. “As time went on, that slice became more and more narrowed.”

She abstained from the vote Thursday on whether to support the code.

In the past, the app industry has been heavily criticized by some federal regulators and consumer advocates for collecting personal details from users without their knowledge or consent. A review last year by the Federal Trade Commission of 400 popular children’s apps available on Google and Apple platforms concluded that only 20 percent disclosed their data collection practices.

The code of conduct would require participating mobile app developers to show notices indicating whether their apps collected user-specific details in any of eight categories: biometrics, including fingerprints or facial recognition data; Web browsing history; logs of phone calls or texts made or received; contact list details like e-mail addresses or social network connections; financial information, like credit or banking data; health or medical data; precise location data; and stored text, video or photo files.

Signatories to the code would also have to list any of eight categories of entities with which their apps shared information; these include ad networks; mobile carriers; consumer data resellers; data analytics companies; government entities; operating systems; social networks; or other apps.

Companies that violated a promise to adhere to the code would be subject to enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission. The code is the first step in a larger plan by the Obama administration to institute a wide-ranging consumer privacy bill of rights that would give consumers some rights to access, control and correct the personal details companies collected about them.

Last year, the White House issued a report proposing that Congress enact such a consumer privacy bill. The report said the bill would rely on codes of conduct, worked out in industry-advocacy group negotiations, to specify how different industries would adhere to those principles. The administration has yet to make public the proposed text for the legislation.

But some participants who helped develop the mobile app transparency notices said the modest gains that resulted for consumers indicated a need for stronger privacy legislation and regulation.

“If we want to move expeditiously through bigger issues, we are going to need some legislative action,” said Christopher Calabrese, legislative counsel for privacy issues at the Washington office of the A.C.L.U."

But Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said, “Neither the I.R.S. nor the Department of Health and Human Services will have access to medical records or other personal history, no access whatsoever.”

Mr. Levin said that Republicans, in their zeal to undo the health care overhaul, were neglecting other important issues.

“This bill is nothing more than a continuation of the Republicans’ blind obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act,” Mr. Levin said. “Their mission is to destroy, not implement, health care reform.”

Four Democrats — Representatives John Barrow of Georgia, Jim Matheson of Utah, Mike McIntyre of North Carolina and Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota — crossed party lines and voted for the bill. No Republicans voted against it.

Separately, Mr. Obama came to the rescue of members of Congress and their aides on Friday, saying that the federal government would continue paying a large share of their health insurance premiums. Ambiguous provisions of the health care law had created serious doubts about whether such contributions would continue.

Under the arrangement devised by the administration, lawmakers and aides who work in their personal offices will have to get coverage through new state-based markets known as insurance exchanges.

Mr. Obama has said that he will get health insurance through an exchange. And the White House said Friday that he would support legislation putting cabinet officers and members of the White House staff into the marketplaces as well.

Lawmakers and their aides, like many federal workers, generally receive coverage through the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The government pays roughly 70 percent of premiums, contributing $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $11,000 for family coverage under some of the most popular plans.

The 2010 law generally requires lawmakers and thousands of their aides to get coverage through the exchanges. It does not provide any obvious way for the federal government to continue paying its share of the premiums.

The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said that this provision of the law, aimed mainly at lawmakers, threatened “collateral damage” to staff members.

“Staff did tell me that there would be a problem,” Ms. Pelosi said. “And it was a good opportunity for us to pay tribute to the staff and all that they mean to the workings of Congress. They are a tremendous intellectual resource. They could, shall we say, be better compensated financially outside. Happily they enjoy the psychic rewards of public service.”

Some aides, fearing the loss of federal contributions to their premiums, had begun to look for other jobs.

The Office of Personnel Management, which administers health benefits for federal employees, will provide details of the new arrangement in a proposed regulation to be issued next week.

Under the rule, a White House official said, members of Congress and certain Congressional employees “will enroll in marketplace plans, will not qualify for premium tax credits, and, like private sector employees, will not lose their employer contributions for these health plans.”

The Obama administration has not said how it will calculate the employer contributions. Congressional aides were told that the contributions would be no more than what lawmakers and their aides currently receive under the federal employees health program.

Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said: “Congress should live under the laws it creates. That includes Obamacare. And if the exchanges actually go into effect, Congress should pass a law to put White House and Congressional leadership in the exchanges.”"

Medicine in this country is complex, and there is significant variability in training programs elsewhere. Much of how medical care is provided in any part of the world is rooted in local and regional cultural standards, and mastering these standards can be achieved only by total immersion in that system of medical care over time and under strict supervision.

This invaluable experience is what medical training programs in the United States provide for these foreign-trained doctors who desire to practice here. It would be a disservice to patients and to these talented physicians to create pathways to medical practice that do not include an accredited training program.

The only reason I would go and see foreign-trained physicians in this country is the requirement that they complete the “long slog” to relicensing. Training is woefully inadequate in developing nations. I know this is true for India, as I came from there to the United States more than a decade ago.

To the Editor:

A simple policy change — equalizing the licensing requirements for doctors educated abroad and those educated in the United States — would end current physician shortages in half of the states within five years.

But state regulators are standing in the way of this solution. Our research shows that states with self-financing medical boards, those less subject to public scrutiny, impose stricter licensing requirements.

We also examined the effects of state medical board regulations that require foreign-educated physicians to complete up to two more years of medical residency than their counterparts educated in this country.

Our analysis of immigration records from 1973 to 2010 found that immigrant physicians are less likely to settle in states with the most stringent requirements, states that often have the greatest need for doctors.

To the Editor:

I am an intensive-care pediatrician trained in Australia and Britain. I moved to New York in 2010 and was told, as were the foreign-educated doctors in your article on the ordeal that we must endure to receive a United States medical license, that I would have to complete the usual tests and a residency thereafter.

So I completed the licensing exams and secured a plum residency, in anesthesiology at Cornell. But the prospect of spending 4 years and 80 hours a week on tedious, low-level work away from my family was unbearable, and I withdrew.

Months later, almost by chance, I discovered an alternative route to a medical license. I submitted an application to the New York State Department of Education demonstrating that my overseas medical training was equivalent to or better than what I would have obtained in the United States. Last month, after the department verified my postgraduate training, my license arrived in the mail. No residency required.

Employers hire Equifax to save time and monitor compliance with privacy laws.

Client companies provide employment, payroll and sometimes benefits data to Equifax, which then makes it available, for a fee, to banks, employers and others that it confirms are authorized to receive it. (That includes collection agencies, although Equifax says it releases only employment information like your job title and date of hire to them — not pay details.)

You may be wondering: Do I have a say in any of this?

Equifax says it provides information only to those with a legitimate reason under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and requires anyone seeking income or salary numbers to obtain your explicit consent before releasing it. “The employee has to give permission,” Mr. Adams said.

Data that identifies workers is owned by the employer, not by Equifax, and isn’t distributed to other data collectors, Mr. Adams said, though the company does sell employment trend reports, based on its analysis of anonymous data used with its clients’ approval.

The Federal Trade Commission reached a $350,000 settlement with TALX in 2009 over complaints that it failed to provide necessary disclosures to users of its consumer data and to the companies that provide the information. In an e-mail, the company said that it was complying with the credit reporting act “and has reported evidence of compliance annually to the F.T.C. as required by the settlement.”

Still, it makes sense to check the accuracy of the data Equifax may have on you, since demand for income verification is growing. Mr. Adams said the increase was partly a result of recent legislation requiring credit card companies to verify a consumer’s ability to pay before issuing a card.

In addition, the major credit bureaus (Experian and TransUnion, along with Equifax) have faced criticism from consumer advocates over the accuracy of their data. A recent study by the trade commission found that roughly 5 percent of consumers had errors in their credit reports that could result in higher interest rates on loans.

Agencies providing employment and salary data “haven’t had that level of scrutiny, so we don’t know what the level of accuracy is,” said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. “I would be surprised if it’s better.”

Kevin Kuhn, compliance director at Equifax Workforce Solutions, said its employment data was accurate because it was provided and owned by the employer; Equifax acts as “steward” of the information but doesn’t change it, he said.

Unlike with credit reports, there isn’t a single site where you can request your free annual employment and salary report; you must apply directly to each specialty company. (Among the others that provide job and income verification services are AccuSource and InVerify. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a list of companies that collect personal financial data of various kinds, but it is not comprehensive.)

If your employer uses The Work Number, you can probably obtain your report at theworknumber.com. Otherwise, the site offers a toll-free number (866-604-6570) or a form to send by mail; you’ll need to provide your Social Security number as well as proof of identity, like a copy of your driver’s license and a utility bill.

The report will include all employment records the company has on file for you, and will show what companies have sought verifications in the last 24 months. If you’ve never worked for a company that uses The Work Number, however, the report probably will be blank.

Here are some other questions that may arise as you apply:

? How long will it take to get a report?

According to the form on The Work Number, your request will be processed in 15 days and the results will be mailed to you.

? What should I do if I find a discrepancy?

The Work Number’s Web site says you can call the service at 800-367-2884, and it will contact your employer to investigate.

? What if I feel the company isn’t adequately handling my inquiry?

You can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."

The program also lets people correct or suppress individual data elements, or to opt out entirely of having Acxiom collect and store marketing data about them.

With about $1.1 billion in revenue in its 2013 fiscal year, Acxiom is a leading player in an industry called data brokerage. The company collects, stores, analyzes and sells consumer data with the aim of helping its clients — including well-known banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, department stores and carmakers — tailor marketing to their most valuable current customers or identify new customers.

A credit card issuer, for instance, could ask Acxiom to help aim a campaign for elite-level cards with concierge services at people above a certain income who live in certain suburbs or drive luxury cars. To do that, Acxiom, like many of its competitors, often uses its own proprietary classification system to segment consumers into socioeconomic marketing categories, like “Frugal Families” or “McMansions and Minivans.”

Some federal regulators and privacy advocates warn that this kind of data-mining could be used to aim at consumers vulnerable to predatory lending practices, for instance, or to favor certain high-value consumers with instant, attentive customer service while relegating other people to interminable wait time.

Mr. Howe says he wants to counter such fears by making industry practices more transparent. A former Microsoft executive, he came to Acxiom as C.E.O. in 2011, bringing the online industry’s enthusiasm for data sharing to what had been a hermetic company.

“We are not going to get anywhere by hiding,” he said in a recent interview at Acxiom’s headquarters in Little Rock, Ark. “You have to make things visible.”

But AbouttheData.com is as much ruthlessly pragmatic as idealistic. Mr. Howe recognizes that regulation of his industry may be coming and that it’s better for Acxiom to be seen as a part of the solution than a part of the problem.

ONE afternoon in late August, Mr. Howe sat in an executive conference room at Acxiom’s headquarters overlooking the Arkansas River, demonstrating a version of AbouttheData.com that was still a work in progress. Having filled out an identity verification form that asked for his name, birth date, address and the last four digits of his Social Security number, he landed on a page that gave him a choice of six data categories to examine.

Visitors who log in may be surprised at the volume of information that may be available and the detailed picture it can give of their personal lives. The household interest section, for instance, listed Mr. Howe as interested in health and medical issues (he subscribes to health industry trade journals and founded a site called Health123.com); crafts (he periodically works with stained glass); woodworking (he paid for his undergraduate education at Princeton in part by working as an apprentice carpenter); tennis (he was on his high school team); gardening (his wife subscribes to Fine Gardening magazine); and “religious/inspirational.”

“I don’t know how inspirational I am,” Mr. Howe said. “I am Methodist. My uncle is a Methodist preacher. I go to church very regularly.”

But consumers, he said, should not expect all information to be current or correct. For instance, the site listed Mr. Howe as the father of two; in fact, he is the father of three. It had also pegged him as Italian, but he is actually of Norwegian descent. (The system predicts likely ethnicity based on surname and is clearly imperfect.)

The home section, meanwhile, which listed such details as the year his house was built and its estimated market value, had incorrect information about his mortgage. “I don’t have a loan on my house anymore. It’s drawing on old data,” Mr. Howe explained. “That’s one I would absolutely go in and change.”

If a personal detail is corrected on the site, the new entry will appear with an aside noting the previous, incorrect entry, letting consumers see what they amended. Mr. Howe acknowledged that the system was fallible because Acxiom obtains information from many different suppliers, and the latest data is not always available in its databases. He said he couldn’t predict how Acxiom’s clients might react to a system that lets consumers update profiles and perhaps fictionalize them, or opt out altogether from Acxiom’s marketing database.

“What happens if a flock of people who are 45 decide to be 39?” Mr. Howe asked. “What happens if 20 percent of the American population decides to opt out? It would be devastating for our business.”

If past consumer behavior is any sign, the number of opt-outs isn’t likely to be high. For instance, Forrester Research reported this year that only 18 percent of Web users had activated an option in their browsers, called Do Not Track, that informs sites and ad networks that they don’t want their browsing histories tracked for marketing purposes.

“It’s a little bit of a risk,” Mr. Howe added of the opt-out provision. “But I feel it’s the right thing to do.”

It may be both the right and the timely thing. The new consumer site should help Acxiom get out in front of potential regulation — at a time when the company is about to introduce a more powerful consumer-targeting engine for its corporate clients that may well set off an outcry from privacy advocates. Last year, some members of Congress opened inquiries into the business practices of data brokers in light of an investigation by The New York Times.

Unlike consumer reporting agencies, which are required by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act to show consumers free copies of their credit reports every 12 months and let them correct errors, information resellers like Acxiom aren’t required to share marketing data with consumers and allow corrections. But some legislators and regulators believe that they should be.

“Citizens don’t know what of our personal information is on file or how it is being used,” Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, wrote in an op-ed article in The Washington Post in August, asking companies like Acxiom to make their practices more transparent. She added: “This frames the fundamental challenge to consumer privacy in the online marketplace: our loss of control over our most private and sensitive information.”

Industry representatives say it is unnecessary to show consumers their marketing data because, they say, reputable companies limit that data’s use to innocuous purposes; they also contend that such consumer services would be too technically challenging and expensive to develop. In an open letter to Ms. Brill responding to her article, the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, said consumer access programs “would lead to more fraud and limit the efficacy of companies and data.”

Acxiom’s new site seems calculated to allay regulators’ concerns, at least in part, and to challenge the industry status quo at the same time.

“You may be surprised to know that we are in favor of heightened industry regulation, but we want to make sure we have a voice in the process,” Mr. Howe said. Aboutthedata.com is Acxiom’s bid to have a say in any legislative or regulatory developments. “If we are on our front foot, if we innovate and we are learning,” he said, “we think that earns us a seat at the table.”

MR. HOWE calls himself a “data geek” and believes that every business decision could be made better with “the intelligent application of data.” He uses that strategy to inform his own pursuits.

When he was new to Little Rock and wanted to find great barbecue, he canvassed Acxiom employees by e-mail and received several hundred responses. He visited the 10 most recommended places and later sent his rankings, with the reasons behind them, to employees. (The winner was the Whole Hog Cafe.)

As Mr. Howe envisioned an Acxiom consumer portal, he used a similar method, researching how other industries have responded to consumer concerns about lack of transparency. He saw how Subway, the sandwich chain, made nutrition information clearer and introduced a customer, Jared Fogle, to personify healthier menu options. Mr. Howe also consulted executives at credit reporting bureaus for advice on how a business-to-business industry could create a service for consumers.

“Everybody said the hardest thing was changing the culture,” he said. “Take Acxiom. For 40 years, we talked about our three constituencies: our shareholders, our associates and our clients. But there’s a fourth constituency: consumers.”

Even so, Aboutthedata.com is a self-serving endeavor, promoting Acxiom’s take on data-powered marketing to consumers. In fact, Mr. Howe sees the potential for developing a consumer business at Acxiom in which people could customize the kinds of advertising they want to see by selecting the activities and brands that interest them via AbouttheData.com. Consumers are going to receive ads no matter what, he said, so they may as well elect to receive pitches for stuff they enjoy.

Acxiom plans to add more data elements to the site regularly. Eventually, Mr. Howe said, the site may even ask people for more information about themselves in exchange for special services, online subscriptions or discounts. “Could this be a new utility for consumers, having a user agent where they can choose the information they want to share?” he said.

Although the site shows visitors a few facts that some might consider sensitive, like race and ethnicity, it initially omits, at least in the version I saw, intimate references — like “gambling,” “senior needs,” “smoker in the household” and “adult with wealthy parent” — that Acxiom markets to corporate clients but that might discomfit consumers if they knew they were for sale. (Acxiom said that the site includes the “core” facts it has collected about consumers, but that it might add “derived” data, like propensity for gambling, at a later date.)

This kind of anodyne presentation of data-mining, says Joseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, could prompt people to collude in their own surveillance by perfecting their profiles. That would improve the quality and resale value of the data for Acxiom, he says, perhaps to consumers’ detriment.

“Bits of Acxiom data that seem totally benign on their own could be matched with other data and used in ways that consumers don’t want it to be used,” said Professor Turow, who had not yet seen the new Acxiom site.

Privacy advocates like Professor Turow warn that this kind of system could influence consumers to provide more information than is good for them. “It’s just a game they are playing for marketing purposes and to make regulators feel better,” he said of the Acxiom project.

But Mr. Howe said Acxiom planned to solicit and respond to feedback once the site opens. “Some people are going to say, ‘That’s not nearly good enough,’ ” he said. “This is a first step.”"

His patient, Patricia Gannon, needed a partial denture. The cost: more than $5,700.

Ms. Gannon, 78, was staggered. She said she could not afford it. And her insurance would pay only a small portion. But she was barely out of the chair, her mouth still sore, when her dentist’s office held out a solution: a special line of credit to help cover her bill. Before she knew it, Ms. Gannon recalled, the office manager was taking down her financial details.

But what seemed like the perfect answer — seemed, in fact, like just what the doctor ordered — has turned into a quagmire. Her new loan ensured that the dentist, Dr. Dan A. Knellinger, would be paid in full upfront. But for Ms. Gannon, the price was steep: an annual interest rate of about 23 percent, with a 33 percent penalty rate kicking in if she missed a payment.

She said that Dr. Knellinger’s office subsequently suggested another form of financing, a medical credit card, to pay for more work. Now, her minimum monthly dental bill, roughly $214 all told, is eating up a third of her Social Security check. If she is late, she faces a penalty of about $50.

“I am worried that I will be paying for this until I die,” says Ms. Gannon, who lives in Dunedin, Fla. Dr. Knellinger, who works out of Palm Harbor, Fla., did not respond to requests for comment.

In dentists’ and doctors’ offices, hearing aid centers and pain clinics, American health care is forging a lucrative alliance with American finance. A growing number of health care professionals are urging patients to pay for treatment not covered by their insurance plans with credit cards and lines of credit that can be arranged quickly in the provider’s office. The cards and loans, which were first marketed about a decade ago for cosmetic surgery and other elective procedures, are now proliferating among older Americans, who often face large out-of-pocket expenses for basic care that is not covered by Medicare or private insurance.

The American Medical Association and the American Dental Association have no formal policy on the cards, but some practitioners refuse to use them, saying they threaten to exploit the traditional relationship between provider and patient. Doctors, dentists and others have a financial incentive to recommend the financing because it encourages patients to opt for procedures and products that they might otherwise forgo because they are not covered by insurance. It also ensures that providers are paid upfront — a fact that financial services companies promote in marketing material to providers.

One of the financing companies, iCare Financial of Atlanta, which offers financing plans through providers’ offices, asks providers on its Web site: “How much money are you losing everyday by not offering iCare to your patients?” Over the last three years, the company’s enrollment has grown 320 percent. Another company posted a video online that shows patients suddenly vanishing outside a medical office because they cannot afford treatment. The company offers a financing plan as a remedy, with the scene on the video shifting to a smiling doctor with dollar signs headed toward him.

A review by The New York Times of dozens of customer contracts for medical cards and lines of credit, as well as of hundreds of court filings in connection with civil lawsuits brought by state authorities and others, shows how perilous such financial arrangements can be for patients — and how advantageous they can be for health care providers.

Many of these cards initially charge no interest for a promotional period, typically six to 18 months, an attractive feature for people worried about whether they can afford care. But if the debt is not paid in full when that time is up, costly rates — usually 25 to 30 percent — kick in, the review by The Times found. If payments are late, patients face additional fees and, in most cases, their rates increase automatically. The higher rates are often retroactive, meaning that they are applied to patients’ original balances, rather than to the amount they still owe.

For patients, the financial consequences can be dire.

Ms. Gannon said she was happy with her dental care, despite the cost, and there was no suggestion that Dr. Knellinger had done anything wrong. But attorneys general in a several states have filed lawsuits claiming that other dentists and professionals have misled patients about the financial terms of the cards, employed high-pressure sales tactics, overcharged for treatments and billed for unauthorized work.

The New York attorney general’s office found that health care providers had pressured patients into getting credit cards from one company, CareCredit, a unit of General Electric, which gave some providers discounts based on the volume of transactions. Patients, the investigation found, were misled about the terms of the credit cards, and in some instances, duped into believing that they were agreeing to a payment plan with dental offices when, in fact, they were being pushed into high-cost credit."

Parents may not be aware of the security and privacy risks to their children, these experts say, because schools are not required to notify parents or obtain their consent before sharing student’s details with vendors who perform institutional functions.

New research on how school districts handle the transfer of student data to companies, for instance, has found that administrators have signed contracts without clauses to protect personal details like children’s contact information, age ranges or where they wait for school buses every morning. Researchers at Fordham University School of Law in New York are reporting, for example, that certain school districts’ contracts for cafeteria service payment features on student ID cards would allow companies to collect, store, share and sell information on everything a student buys and eats at school. That could have implications for students’ families.

“Companies could sell that information to advertisers or insurance companies,” said Joel R. Reidenberg, a law professor at Fordham and the lead researcher on the report, whose findings his team plans to publish next month. “Because a kid drinks a lot of soda, a family might have to pay higher insurance premiums or have trouble getting dental insurance.”

Schools are sharing student data with more educational technology providers and with other companies, he said, partly to keep up with mounting student testing and reporting requirements and partly to keep down internal technology costs. That outsourcing has been made easier because of changes to federal regulation under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

That law requires schools to obtain a parent’s permission before sharing information in their children’s records. But the Education Department updated its rules in 2008, allowing schools to disclose student information to contractors and other outside parties to whom they outsource school functions — without notifying parents.

Common Sense Media hopes to prompt educational technology executives and education officials to institute national standards for the sharing and use of student data. Mr. Steyer said he was particularly concerned about sensitive details like students’ health, disabilities, disciplinary records, demographics, financial status and family situations.

“We are challenging the industry and educators to get this right upfront now, in contrast to consumer data where industry made all of the rules and shaped them in the best interests of the industry,” Mr. Steyer said. “We don’t think it should work that way with student data.”

Some states are pursuing student data transparency and privacy legislation.

This year, Oklahoma enacted a law that requires the state Board of Education to publicly post a list of the kinds of data it collects about individual students and to develop detailed student data privacy policies and security measures. The New York State Assembly recently passed a bill that prohibits schools from sharing personally identifiable data about students without parental consent.

“This protects families about certain issues that may not be appropriate for the world to know for the rest of your life,” said Assemblyman Daniel J. O’Donnell, a Democrat representing the Upper West Side of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill.

But Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been a staunch advocate of children’s privacy, said federal standards were needed to ensure that parents have access to and control over information in their children’s educational records.

“It’s clear to me that parents, not schools, have the right to control their children’s information, even if it’s in the hands of private companies,” Mr. Markey said in a phone interview on Friday. “I am going to ask the Department of Education to lay out specific guidelines to protect students from having their records compromised.”"

A Congressional probe into the multibillion-dollar data brokerage industry – companies that collect, analyze, sell or share personal details about consumers for marketing purposes – is intensifying.

On Wednesday afternoon, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat, sent a letter to Donald Robert, the chief executive of Experian, asking for information about a company subsidiary, called Court Ventures, that sold sensitive consumer data, allegedly to an identity theft service in Vietnam.

Senator Rockefeller is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which last year began investigating the practices of nine leading data brokers including Experian, a credit bureau that also offers marketing and fraud prevention services.

“The committee’s investigation has focused to date on how companies including Experian collect and sell consumer information for marketing purposes, while the information Experian reportedly sold to identity thieves – such as Social Security numbers and banking information – appears to be data Experian collects and sells for risk assessment activities,” Mr. Rockefeller wrote in the letter to Mr. Robert. “However, if these recent news accounts are accurate, they raise serious questions about whether Experian as a company has appropriate practices in place for vetting its customers and sharing sensitive consumer data with them, regardless of the particular line of business.”

Mr. Rockefeller’s letter is part of a larger effort by the Commerce Committee to understand how companies collect, share and sell intimate details about the shopping habits, health concerns, family circumstances and financial status of consumers at a time when Americans are increasingly sharing personal information online.

The letter cited an article by KrebsOnSecurity.com, an Internet security news site, which published a report Sunday on the alleged sale of sensitive data by Court Ventures to the Web site Superget.info, whose administrators were based in Vietnam.

The report said that Court Ventures had signed a data-sharing agreement with another information services firm, called U.S. Info Search, and that Court Ventures had resold the other company’s data to Superget.info.

Last week, the Department of Justice announced an indictment against one of the administrators of the Superget.info site, a Vietnamese national named Hieu Minh Ngo. Among other allegations, the indictment charges him with conspiracy to commit identity fraud and aggravated identity theft.

Experian bought Court Ventures, described on Experian.com as an aggregator that repackages and resells electronically available public records data “obtained from more than 1,400 state and county sources,” in 2012.

In a statement, Gerry Tschopp, a spokesman for Experian, said: “After the acquisition, the U.S. Secret Service notified Experian that Court Ventures had been and was reselling data from U.S. Info Search to a third party that the U.S. Secret Service was investigating as possibly engaged in illegal activity. Following the notice by the U.S. Secret Service, Experian discontinued reselling U.S. Info Search data and worked closely and in full cooperation with law enforcement to bring Vietnamese national Hieu Minh Ngo, the alleged perpetrator, to justice.”

He added that “no Experian database was accessed” and that the suspect in the case had obtained access to the data before Experian acquired the company.

Experian, which reported revenue of $4.73 billion in its 2013 fiscal year, had already come under scrutiny by Mr. Rockefeller before the news reports this week.

Last year, the senator asked data brokers including Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and Reed Elsevier, which owns the Lexis-Nexis database, to provide a list of all sources from which the companies obtained information on consumers; a list of the types of details the companies collected about consumers; and a list of the services and data they offer to third parties.

One data broker, for instance, estimated that more than 250,000 Web sites apprise consumers that they share data with third parties.

But, according to Mr. Rockefeller’s letter to Mr. Robert, Experian to date has “refused to fully respond” to the Commerce Committee’s request for the identities of Experian’s sources of consumer data and the purchasers of that data.

Mr. Tschopp, the Experian spokesman, said: “We have responded — and will continue to respond – in a very transparent manner to Senator Rockefeller.”

Last month, Mr. Rockefeller widened his probe, asking a dozen popular Web sites to provide information on their information-sharing practices with data brokers. The sites included About.com, Babycenter.com, Bankrate.com, Health.com, Investopedia.com, Mensfitness.com and Self.com.

“While some consumers may not object to having their information categorized and used for marketing,” Mr. Rockefeller wrote to executives at the sites, “before they share personal information, it is important that they know it may be used for purposes beyond those for which they originally provided it.”"

Many users of the website have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of documents like driver’s licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards, or sent them to the office of the federal insurance marketplace in London, Ky.

Administration officials said the government had established strict procedures to verify that people applying for insurance were who they said they were, in order to prevent fraud and identity theft. But a breakdown in the process instead is causing concern among some consumers about the handling of their personal information.

“I am in no man’s land,” said Roger N. Hampton of Boca Raton, Fla., who filed an application early last month. “I have been waiting patiently for my ID verification to come through, which has not occurred thus far. So I can’t see what plans are available.”

When he tried to file his application online, Mr. Hampton received a message that said: “Your identity wasn’t verified. You won’t be able to submit your application for health coverage until your identity is verified. Submit documents that prove your identity. Once you upload your documents, they’ll be reviewed. The results of your identity verification will be emailed to you.”

Mr. Hampton hit a button that said, “Upload documents” and attached copies of his Social Security card and driver’s license. He said he had heard nothing back.

John W. Filbin of New London, N.H., reported a similar experience. “I have been stuck in identity proofing since early October,” he said Monday.

On Friday, the Obama administration announced that it would give people eight more days, until Dec. 23, to sign up for coverage that takes effect on Jan. 1

But Mr. Filbin said: “We don’t need extra time. We’ve been ready since Oct. 1. I have emailed and hard mailed my driver’s license. We’ve made our way through the slow and troubled website. Is there going to be a fix for us?”

People who cannot establish their identity by answering certain questions at HealthCare.gov are instructed to call the help desk at Experian, a credit reporting agency, for “ID proofing.”

Customer service representatives for the federal marketplace and for Experian said they had received calls from many people who were unable to verify their identity, and internal government documents show that lower-level federal employees have known of a problem for weeks.

Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that 90 percent of consumers were able to create accounts and complete “identity proofing” online.

“However,” she said, “some consumers whose information does not match records, such as when an alternate name is used or their address does not match, may be referred to a call center” for identification verification, and in complicated cases they may experience “a wait time before receiving a determination.”

Mr. Filbin said he had called Experian, but got no help because he did not have a “reference number.” Experian sent him back to HealthCare.gov, which has repeatedly indicated that his identity verification is “in process.”

Jo Ann Fields of Felton, Del., appears to be lost in the same labyrinth. “I mailed a copy of my voter registration card on Oct. 24, and I have not heard anything back,” Ms. Fields said. “I uploaded the voter registration card, and they said I would get an email response. I have had no response. I called the health insurance marketplace — 800-318-2596 — and they say to give it more time. My application is stuck in ID verification.”

Consumers said they worried that their identification papers were falling into a black hole. Ms. Fields said she imagined “a bag of mail sitting on somebody’s desk in London, Ky., with my voter registration card in it.” Insurance agents and brokers who want to help people enroll in the federal marketplace also need to go through “identity proofing,” and they say they, too, have experienced difficulties.

Mr. Filbin said the experience was particularly annoying because “I am in favor of the Affordable Care Act,” and he added: “I was an Obama supporter. I think I still am, but a little less positive.”

Experian is based in Dublin. Two spokesmen for the company, Gerry Tschopp and Michael Troncale, said they could not discuss Experian’s work for the federal insurance program because of restrictions in its contract with the government.

The federal website says identity verification is needed to protect consumers’ personal information.

Consumers are asked questions that, according to the government, only they can answer. The questions are based on information in their credit reports — even though federal officials expect to receive many applications from young people and low-income people with little credit history.

The administration said that the website had another “unscheduled outage” on Monday, for about an hour. Still, administration officials said they were on track to meet their commitment that HealthCare.gov would “work smoothly for the vast majority of users” by Saturday."

Without explicit prohibitions on the nonacademic use of the information, specialists warn that unflattering data could hypothetically be shared with colleges or employers, to the detriment of the student.

The Fordham study suggested that some districts might not fully grasp the implications of outsourcing data handling or may lack the negotiating power to insist on contracts that restrict information use.

“The report raises the possibility that abuses could happen with student data if contracting practices don’t come up to snuff,” said Kathleen Styles, the chief privacy officer of the Department of Education. Although the agency had no evidence of such abuses, she said, it is developing best practices for schools to use in “contracting out for web services and for transparency with parents.”

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, schools that receive federal funding must generally obtain written permission from parents before sharing students’ educational records. An exception allows school districts to share student information with companies, like those providing student information systems, without parental consent. The exception requires school districts to have direct control over such contractors’ use of student information; if contractors misuse the data, regulators may ban districts from sharing further data with those companies.

In a statement, the Software and Information Industry Association faulted the Fordham study for examining school contracts and policies, but not actual industry practices. The group said the law had created a business culture that respected student privacy.

The Fordham researchers examined how schools approached student data privacy by first calling officials at a cross-section of small, medium and large school districts in different parts of the country; then they used open-records laws to request copies of each district’s Web services contracts and policies for staff technology use. Microsoft provided an unrestricted grant for the research.

The study reported that districts hire online services to monitor individual student progress, analyze aggregate performances of classes and schools, host school data and manage school transportation.

Although the school systems were required to respond to the request for information, only 20 of 54 districts provided full documentation by the deadline, the study said. Researchers said they encountered “significant difficulty reaching any district personnel who were familiar with the district’s outsourcing practices.”

“When you talk about transparency, the fact that we had to be persistent, I think, is a public policy problem,” Dr. Reidenberg said.

Among the districts that did provide documents, less than a quarter of the contracts specified the purpose for which student information would be disclosed, the study said; and less than 7 percent restricted companies from selling student data or using it for marketing. Several districts lacked policies governing staff members’ computer use — meaning that teachers would potentially be able to sign up for free apps or sites that collected information about students without school officials vetting the programs.

The study suggests that school districts have wildly varying degrees of legal expertise and resources to devote to data protection.

Certainly, many districts make an effort to be vigilant. The South Orangetown Central School District in Blauvelt, N.Y., for example, is conducting an audit to examine how its contracts cover sharing or reuse of student data.

“The kinds of applications, software and online resources have changed so much in such a short period of time that it’s hard for districts to keep pace,” said the district superintendent, Ken Mitchell. “There are so many questions about the data sharing between primary and secondary vendors that, until we have that fully understood, we need to slow this thing down.”

The Fordham study urged that contracts specify the type of services a company provides, list the types of information collected and limit the redisclosure of students’ details. The researchers also recommended that education officials notify parents about the nature of information disclosed to third parties and post information about privacy protections on district websites.

Some industry experts envision a national approach to protecting student information.

Steve Mutkoski, the government policy director for Microsoft’s worldwide public sector business, recommended that the technology industry voluntarily agree not to use student data for advertising, marketing or profiling students, as his company has done for schools that use certain Microsoft software.

“At a bare minimum, if that is not going to reach an industry consensus,” Mr. Mutkoski said, “there should at least be greater transparency about the use that vendors plan to make of the data.”"

Ms. Snyder could not be reached for comment.

The move comes after a series of congressional oversight hearings at which Republicans and Democrats sought to determine who should be held accountable for the health law’s disastrous rollout. At one such hearing on Oct. 30, Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, was asked who was responsible for developing the federal website, and she named Ms. Snyder. But Ms. Sebelius quickly added: “Michelle Snyder is not responsible for those debacles. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I’m responsible.”

Ms. Snyder’s official biography states that she was responsible for setting up “new programs and activities required by the Affordable Care Act.”

In an email to agency employees, Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Medicare agency, said Ms. Snyder was retiring this week “after 41 years of outstanding public service,” but made no mention of her role overseeing the development of the federal insurance exchange.

“While we celebrate her distinguished career, we are also sadly saying farewell to a good friend and a key member of the agency’s leadership team,” Ms. Tavenner wrote. “Michelle’s intelligence, experience and formidable work ethic have been indispensable to me and to many of you during her tenure.”

Ms. Tavenner said that Ms. Snyder was prepared to step down at the end of 2012, but stayed on the job “at my request to help me with the challenges facing C.M.S. in 2013.”

The agency, which runs Medicare and Medicaid in addition to carrying out major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, provides health insurance to more than 100 million people and spends more than $800 billion a year, which is substantially more than the Defense Department budget.

Agency officials said that Ms. Snyder’s deputy, Tim Love, would fill her position on an acting basis.

Many of the initial problems with the federal insurance exchange have been fixed, but their effects linger as the agency and insurers try to correct enrollment records.

In late September, Ms. Snyder signed an internal memo acknowledging that security controls for the website had not been fully tested and recommending a plan to reduce the risks.

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican of California and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said: “Documents and interviews indicate Michelle Snyder’s involvement in bypassing the recommendation of C.M.S.’s top security expert, who recommended delaying the launch of HealthCare.gov.”

However, Patti Unruh, a spokeswoman for the Medicare agency, said: “There have been no successful security attacks on HealthCare.gov, and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information.”

Ms. Snyder became the first chief financial officer of the agency in the late 1990s. In August, she signed a document approving a contract worth up to $11.6 million for “urgently needed financial management services” at the new insurance exchanges. The document said the government did not have time to allow competitive bidding because it had just discovered that it needed more financial expertise."

Relman, a noted medical educator and author, realized the importance of nursing care.","Photo

Last June, the month he turned 90, Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the eminent former medical educator and editor, fell down a flight of stairs at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He cracked his skull and broke three vertebrae in his neck and more bones in his face.

By the time he arrived at the emergency room, blood was flowing into his brain and impinging on his windpipe, leading to severe choking and dangerously low oxygen levels. Surgeons cut into his neck to connect a breathing tube from his trachea to a mechanical respirator.

Amid the disciplined medical havoc, his heart stopped three times. Resuscitation efforts saved his life, but at the cost of several broken ribs. His condition remained precarious as he developed complications and endured still more medical procedures.

Astonishingly, he lived to write about all this. After a painful 10-week hospital stay and months of rehabilitation, he can walk — gingerly, with a cane — and is largely recovered, with his mental faculties intact.

His riveting account of the medical adventure, in the Feb. 6 issue of The New York Review of Books, is a testimonial to the best emergency medical care and a tremendous will to live. At the same time, however, it betrays a surprising lack of awareness of some critical aspects of the medical profession and the nation’s fragmented health care system.

Despite decades as a medical educator, researcher, author and editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Relman confesses that he “had never before understood how much good nursing care contributes to patients’ safety and comfort, especially when they are very sick or disabled.” Nor did he appreciate the hypnotizing effects of technology, which robs patients of the physician’s bedside manner and affects the training of younger doctors.

How is it that a leading medical professor like Dr. Relman — who has taught hundreds of young doctors at Boston University, the University of Pennsylvania (where he was chairman of the department of medicine) and Harvard — might not have known about the value of modern-day Florence Nightingales?

A number of doctors who have talked to me about Dr. Relman’s article suggest that the culture of medical education may be largely to blame. For example, younger doctors in hospitals spend part of the day on rounds, following professors in their long white coats. Many of these august figures are supremely confident in their observations and opinions; others are more compassionate.

What professors impart on those rounds can have a major effect on the behavior of younger doctors when they go into practice and teach succeeding generations.

Dr. Relman’s initial care was in a major teaching hospital, Massachusetts General in Boston, where the kind of doctors he taught — students, interns and residents — provided the round-the-clock attention that kept him alive. Yet he did not write directly about their role, referring to them only as “a team.”

On their rounds, some medical professors prefer to talk in a hallway just outside the patient’s room as they discuss test results that are crucial in planning further care. Such behavior appears impersonal, perceived perhaps as a way of shielding bad information.

But many doctors see it as efficient, because they can note the information they deem most important — like heart rate, blood pressure and rate of intravenous drip — by standing at a patient’s door and looking in at the monitors. Feeling no need to go to the bedside, they do not. Instead they rely on nurses, failing to recognize that such behavior omits crucial elements in patient care — the physical touch and the personal touch.

Dr. Relman owes the extension of his life to drugs and devices that did not exist in their present form, if at all, when he was younger. Over the years, the surge in the number of such advances, and most importantly in their hazards, has made work vastly more complicated for doctors, nurses and other health workers. Despite the advantages of technology, tender, loving care from family and nurses is priceless, as is the bedside manner of a sympathetic doctor.

But technology’s monitors, images and devices can deflect that doctor’s attention, as Dr. Relman learned when he reviewed his hospital records and the notes he wrote to nurses and his wife, Dr. Marcia Angell (particularly while he was unable to speak because of the breathing tube).

Instead of descriptions of his appearance and feelings, the doctors’ progress notes in his electronic medical records were filled with technical data. “Conversations with my physicians were infrequent, brief and hardly ever reported,” he wrote, adding:

“What personal care hospitalized patients now get is mostly from nurses. When nursing is not optimal, patient care is never good.”

Many hospital administrators have cut nursing staffs. They say it is to make ends meet; many doctors say it is usually to increase the bottom line.

Nurses’ observations and suggestions have saved many doctors from making fatal mistakes in caring for patients. Though most physicians are grateful for such aid, a few dismiss it — out of arrogance and a mistaken belief that a nurse cannot know more than a doctor.

In many ways, Dr. Relman’s insights reflect changes and generational gaps in training doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Because these disciplines have traditionally been taught in separate silos, they often do not work as tightly as they should.

Now, as health care financing changes and doctors spend more time training in outpatient settings, a growing movement demands coordinating the education of health professionals to prepare them to work more smoothly in teams. If these efforts succeed, perhaps the next generation of doctors will no longer be surprised at the importance of nurses and other allied professionals."

Hackers breached a university database containing names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and university identification numbers for faculty, staff, students and personnel who had been issued a university I.D. since 1998. The university said financial, academic, health and phone and address information were not taken.

Wallace D. Loh, the University of Maryland’s president, said he was notified of the breach Tuesday night. “I am truly sorry,” Mr. Loh said in a statement. “Computer and data security are a very high priority of our university.”

By Wednesday, hackers had not taken credit for the attack. Typically, hackers seek such information because it can be used to steal identities, crack bank accounts or can be sold on the black market. Universities make ripe targets because they store vast numbers of personal records, often in decentralized servers.

The records can be a gold mine because students, in particular, often have pristine credit reputations and do not monitor their account activity and credit scores as vigilantly as adults.

Mr. Loh said the University of Maryland would be offering one year of free credit monitoring for those whose information was taken in the breach.

Dozens of universities have been hit by breaches in recent years. In 2012, Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, the University of Rhode Island, the University of Arizona, Queens College and Marquette and 50 other universities were victims of attacks that exposed personal information.

In the breach at Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Johns Hopkins and others in 2012, the hackers who took responsibility said they had done so because they were raising awareness for tuition increases in the United States and changing education laws in Europe, not by profit.

But in a post to the anonymous website Pastebin, they said that in many cases, when they breached the servers at these universities, they found that somebody else had already been there.

“When we got there, we found that a lot of them have malware injected,” the hackers wrote on Pastebin.

In that case, IdentityFinder, a company that works to protect against identity theft following a breach, found that in many cases, the hackers had been inside universities’ systems for at least four months unnoticed.

At the University of Maryland, President Loh said the university had recently doubled its number of security engineers and analysts on staff and had doubled its investment in security tools.

“Universities are a focus in today’s global assaults on I.T. systems,” Mr. Loh said in the statement. “Obviously, we need to do more and better, and we will.”"

Another might allow you to pay off a bill slowly over a year. Many will sell the debt to collection companies, which typically take a cut of the proceeds and decide when or whether to report unpaid debt to credit agencies.

The problem is accelerating for several reasons. Charges are rising. Insurance policies are requiring more patient outlays in the form of higher deductibles and co-payments. More important, perhaps, is that while doctors’ practices traditionally worked out deals for patients who had trouble paying, today many doctors work for large professionally managed groups and hospital systems whose bills are generated far away, by computer.

Both Congress and the protection bureau have been trying to better insulate patient credit scores from the inefficiencies of our market-based medical system. Various proposals have been considered to differentiate medical debt from other forms; it could be erased once it has been paid off or not reported to credit agencies at all, for example. So far, the credit industry has fought successfully against such efforts, noting that they could allow some genuine scofflaws to evade legitimate charges. But it’s also good business, since health care bills are now the largest source of business for collection companies, according to consumer protection agency officials.

Having spent the last year reporting a series on American health costs, I’ve heard plenty about credit casualties.

Gene Cavallo, 61, a New Mexico businessman who put his children through college, had always paid his bills promptly and had an excellent credit rating, until he required surgical excision of a melanoma on his shin two years ago. The more than 60 bills generated for the surgery and six months of follow-up visits — arriving sporadically and ranging from 18 cents to $17,000 — came to $110,000; his insurance covered about $70,000.

When various providers asked him to pay the remaining $40,000, he requested itemized bills and balked at some of the “ridiculously inflated prices,” such as $85 for tweezers and $20 for a box of tissues. He argued the bills point by point, and ultimately agreed to pay $25,000.

But during the negotiations some of the debt was sent to collection. Two years later, he no longer answers the daily robocalls from collection agencies and has had a couple of credit cards canceled because his score has fallen. “It was a scary thing to do because I own a business and dabble in real estate, so the ability to borrow has always been important to me. And now I have no ability, I assume, to borrow for any reason.”

Michael S., who declined to give his full name so as to protect his reputation with business clients, had to declare bankruptcy in Wisconsin more than five years ago after a fraught year in which his toddler was evaluated for what proved to be a benign neurological condition that required no treatment: “You’d get bills for several different doctors’ groups and for tests and M.R.I.s and you don’t know what they are. I was having trouble figuring out who we owed what. And then, if it goes to collection, then suddenly they’re saying we need this paid now.”

With medical expenses, unlike most other purchases, you generally don’t know the price the hospital will charge in advance. And the subsequent bills and insurance statements — so-called explanations of benefits — are often layered in obfuscation and pressure tactics.

Consider Chris Sullivan of Pennsylvania, whose $2,770 bill for an echocardiogram offered a “prompt payment” discount of 20 percent if he wrote a check within 21 days — meaning a discount for not asking questions on a bill for a test he was told would be under $300.

Another “explanation of benefits” statement notified Joe Cotugno of New York City that his two-day hospital stay for a hip replacement was billed at $99,469.70 (doctors’ fees not included). Cigna paid $68,420.53 after knocking off some $28,000 and requiring Mr. Cotugno to pay $3,018.41. So, it informed him, “You saved 96 percent.” Huh?

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been studying the impact of medical billing on credit scores since 2012, acknowledging that unpaid medical bills in collection “frequently end up on consumer credit reports,” as an outgrowth of “very complex and confusing systems of figuring out who owes what after a medical procedure.” Mr. Cordray, the bureau’s director, said it would take appropriate action if harmful practices were identified.

Bills in Congress that would regulate the practices have been stalled for years. The Medical Debt Relief Act was passed by the House in 2010, but never made it to a Senate vote. After a modified version of the bill failed to pass again last year, another act was recently introduced in the Senate and House.

Meanwhile, patients are right to worry. When Matt Meyer, who owns a saddle-fitting company in New Hampshire, set up a monthly payment plan after some surgery, he was distressed to notice that the invoices came from a debt collector. “I had no idea this was considered debt,” he said, and wondered: “Are they reporting that” to a credit agency?

Good question."

The project comprises 16 research groups that want to study different aspects of the data. Scientists from each group are meeting on Tuesday in Boston with a group of 150 volunteers whom the project’s executive director, Jason Bobe, calls “omic astronauts,” from the “ome” in words like genome.

Since then more than 3,360 participants have enrolled and the genetic data for more than 600 have been posted online. Ultimately, the data could be used to answer countless questions about the body; the immediate goal is just to collect the data.

Aspects of the Medicare program were tested in New Orleans; in Broome County, N.Y., which includes Binghamton; and in Arizona. The program was presented to state and local public health officials last month. “We are now moving to scale this really across the country,” said Dr. Nicole Lurie, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response.

The health officials’ intention was to be more proactive in finding vulnerable people like those who suffered and died in disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy. When government teams knocked on doors last year to verify the data and gauge reactions, nearly all the residents allowed them in. Only those who asked how they were found were told.

About a dozen advocates for people with disabilities who were briefed by officials generally expressed support and appreciation of the concern for their community’s needs in emergencies.

Others find the program troubling, however well intentioned. “I think it’s invasive to use their information in this way,” said Christy Dunaway, who works on emergency planning for the National Council on Independent Living, which supports disabled people living at home.

She and others said they were worried that identified individuals could be forced to evacuate to shelters that cannot accommodate people with disabilities, or that incomplete data could provide false assurances of government rescue.

For now, at least, federal officials have resolved not to identify people in “stigmatized groups” who might need help in emergencies, such as those with mental illnesses or intellectual disabilities, or those who are obese.

Dr. Karen DeSalvo, a former New Orleans health director who helped develop the Medicare pilot program and now leads the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, said that the program protected patient privacy and that its benefits outweighed its risks. “This is the next chapter of what good data can do for good purposes,” she said. The federal government has spent more than $22 billion for the digitizing of health records.

“We are all going to have to, I’m hoping, come to some consensus with how we’re balancing privacy and security with the need to save somebody’s life,” Dr. DeSalvo said.

The idea for the program began in Tuscaloosa, Ala., after a tornado struck in April 2011. An ambulance rolled up to one of the houses left standing to take a woman to the hospital because she had run out of oxygen. “That’s kind of crazy, why can’t somebody bring her an oxygen tank?” Dr. Lurie recalled thinking after watching the scene.

She witnessed a similar phenomenon in New York after Hurricane Sandy. Patients who relied on medical equipment needed a place to plug it in before draining the batteries. Many crowded into emergency rooms, stressing the health care system. Others had no way to call for help. Eventually, emergency teams knocked on every door of darkened high-rises, because officials did not know where the people who needed assistance were.

“All of these people just came out of the woodwork,” Dr. Lurie said one public health official told her after a disaster in New England.

“I started to seethe,” Dr. Lurie said. “It’s your job to know who lives in your community.” And if local officials did not, she added, it was the federal government’s responsibility to help.

Respecting the importance of federal and state laws that restrict the disclosure of medical data, the officials found a legal route for Medicare to transfer data on patients’ bills for medical equipment to public health authorities who have systems in place to protect patient privacy. They published a description of it in the Federal Register.

“Now every Medicare beneficiary, at least theoretically, is on notice that their information could be shared in this way,” said Kevin Horahan, a policy analyst with Dr. Lurie’s office.

New Orleans was the first test site. One day last June, with a pretend hurricane bearing down on the city, local officials received 611 names and addresses of residents who depended on oxygen equipment and ventilators. The next day, they sent police, fire and emergency services personnel, along with public health officials and credentialed citizen volunteers, to visit about a third of the homes and see how reliable the information was.

Ms. Finne, the Health Department official, joined a team canvassing one of the poorest sections of New Orleans. “We went and knocked on doors and asked, ‘Does Mrs. Smith live here and have an oxygen concentrator?’ ” she said. Revelations of surveillance on American citizens by the National Security Agency had hit the news five days earlier. “It was one of those situations that you’re like, how are these people going to respond to us showing up?” she said. “Why is government showing up at my doorstep?”

A few residents refused to open their doors, but a vast majority were grateful, Ms. Finne said. The information was both accurate and revealing. In one neighborhood, not a single person with an electronic breathing device had a backup battery in case of a power failure. More than half of those asked said they would need assistance in the event of a hurricane. However, only 15 of the 611 had enrolled in the city’s special needs registry, for those requiring assistance in an emergency. Results of the survey were posted online on Thursday and set to be published in the July issue of the American Journal of Public Health.

A recent power failure affected René Brunét Jr., the 92-year-old owner of New Orleans’ oldest operating movie theater, the Prytania. He uses a ventilator to support his breathing. “I was frightened to death when I was without oxygen for so long,” he said in an interview.

During the drill last June, he was not among those visited by the public health teams. “Believe me, we would have welcomed it,” said his wife, Muriel S. Brunét, 70.

Dr. Lurie’s office is developing a device that can alert family members or rescuers when batteries on medical equipment are low. The Department of Health and Human Services also plans to release an interactive online map this year indicating how many Medicare beneficiaries have wheelchairs and other medical equipment in various ZIP codes, in part to help health officials think about where to place shelters, stockpile supplies, and inform hospitals and power companies about potential needs.

“Even that information is light-years ahead of what they have currently,” Ms. Finne said."

The government has a long list of documents that consumers can use to establish their eligibility. These include copies of birth certificates, Social Security cards, high school diplomas, driver’s licenses, pay stubs and voter registration cards.

“The law requires us to double- and triple-check this data,” said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, so “we’re reaching out to consumers — via mail, email and phone calls — to encourage them to provide supporting documentation.”

Mara Youdelman, a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for low-income people, said: “In some cases, consumers say they already sent the documents to the federal marketplace. They don’t understand why they are being asked to send them in again.”

Even though consumers have sent documents to Serco’s office in London, Ky., the government cannot always link the documents to applications for coverage filed months earlier. In addition, some consumers report persistent problems when they try to upload documents through HealthCare.gov.

For months, Republicans have asserted that the administration was lax in verifying the income and eligibility of people who applied for insurance subsidies.

The government enrolled people “before the systems were in place to accurately confirm eligibility,” said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee.

In some cases, the government told consumers that they had been found eligible for subsidized insurance and could enroll right away. But to keep the coverage, it said, they had to “send the marketplace more information” to verify their eligibility.

Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota, said “many Americans are going to find out that they owe money to the Internal Revenue Service because their premium tax credits were paid incorrectly.”

Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, said such remarks showed the Republicans’ “unending zeal to undermine the Affordable Care Act.”

At the same time, supporters of the health care law worry that some of its chief beneficiaries will be upset if they find next spring that their tax liability is greater than they expected.

Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said he believed that the government would not find major discrepancies in the amounts most consumers should receive in premium tax credits. But he said, “We share concerns that the longer the process of verifying and resolving inconsistencies takes, the more some consumers will owe when they reconcile their tax returns.”

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that subsidies this year will average $4,400 for each person who receives a subsidy. Federal law generally limits the amount that lower- and moderate-income people may be required to repay. A family of four with an annual income of $80,000 could be required to repay as much as $2,500.

Executives at Serco, the federal contractor, said that technical problems with HealthCare.gov had limited their ability to investigate discrepancies.

Until late May, a Serco executive said, the company had to rely on “manual processes” to resolve conflicts between information provided by consumers and information in government databases.

The government was supposed to develop a system to scan documents and transfer information automatically into electronic files, but the system was not developed, so Serco employees had to type in the information. Serco said it took an hour to perform tasks that were expected to take just five minutes.

Subsidies depend on household income and the number of people in a family seeking assistance. But internal memorandums from the Department of Health and Human Services say that the insurance exchanges had no way to verify family size.

The government has also had difficulty checking information about employer-sponsored insurance. The Obama administration delayed until 2015 a requirement for employers to inform the government of insurance that they provide. Workers are generally ineligible for subsidies if they have access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage that meets basic federal standards."

Salesforce, the cloud pioneer known for customer management software, is going into health care.

In an announcement on Thursday, Salesforce and Philips, the Dutch electronics maker, are jointly announcing what they call an “open cloud-based, health care platform.” That means, they say, health care software developers, producers of medical devices, health care providers and insurance companies will be able to link to the Salesforce health cloud.

The foray into health care is a significant step by Salesforce into a specific industry, as opposed to supplying offerings that span industries, like customer relationship management software as a service. It is part of the growth strategy at Salesforce, and is being led by Vivek Kundra, a former chief information officer of the federal government in the Obama administration, who joined Salesforce two years ago. His title is executive vice president of industries.

There have been other high-profile cloud entries in health care, notably Google Health, a personal health records initiative, which opened in 2008 and was shut in 2011. But Salesforce is an enterprise cloud company and it is taking a very different approach. Its initial move, with Philips, is to focus on a specific target in health care — using technology to manage chronic ailments.

The statistics on chronic illnesses are well-known and sobering. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic diseases account for seven of every 10 deaths, and for 75 percent of health care costs in America. The five major chronic conditions, in the CDC list, are heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis and obesity.

Jeroen Tas, chief executive of health care informatics at Philips, points to another set of figures — on the “1 percent” in American health care. Mr. Tas cites a study that found the treatment for 1 percent of the patients in the United States represents 21 percent of the nation’s health care expenses, averaging about $88,000 a patient a year.

The two companies have worked together for the last six months on the health care offering. They are beginning with a couple of applications from Philips built on the Salesforce technology, which allow hospitals and care givers to remotely monitor patients with chronic conditions. “We start where you need the most collaboration, and the health need is greatest,” Mr. Tas said.

The applications work, Mr. Tas explained, by linking patient sensors with smart software over the cloud. Philips is a large producer of a digital patient-sensing devices, including blood pressure cuffs, weight scales, fall detectors and activity trackers.

The data from such devices, Mr. Tas said, is then sent over the Internet, aggregated and analyzed by Philips software to assess which patient among the many being tracked by a nurse practitioner should be the priority — the one in greatest need of advice or assistance and so the first one to be called.

Chronic care management programs are being pursued by most of America’s large and integrated health care providers and can reduce costly hospital admissions and complications. The promise of Saleforce’s cloud approach is that it could reduce the expense of such programs by freeing up hospital groups from having to do much of the technical work themselves.

If the Salesforce health platform succeeds, Mr. Kundra said, it will “unleash a wave of innovation” in health care technology as developers write the “next generation of software apps” in the industry.

For the last few years, Mr. Kundra said, the focus of policy and the industry has been on moving the health care system from paper records to electronic medical records, an effort supported by federal subsidies. “We’re moving,” Mr. Kundra said, “into a post-EMR world,” in which innovation in health care information technology accelerates."

Last year was a record-setting one for the state of New York — and not in a good way.

Public and private institutions in New York experienced more than 900 data breaches in 2013, according to a report released by the state attorney general on Tuesday. Those breaches exposed the personal and financial records of 7.3 million New Yorkers.

The report, which showed the effects of data security intrusions on New Yorkers over the past eight years, said computer hackers were by far the leading cause of the breaches, accounting for nearly 40 percent of unauthorized data access during that time.

In 2013 alone, the breaches cost the public and private sectors more than $1.37 billion, the report said. Losses were calculated by assuming that a data breach costs an affiliated company approximately $188 for each person whose data was compromised, a figure published in a 2013 report by the security company Symantec and the Ponemon Institute, which researches information security.

“What’s truly shocking about this report, beyond the fact that hacking is now the greatest threat to our personal information and costs us billions of dollars, is that many of these breaches could have been prevented,” Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said in a statement. “If millions of New Yorkers were exposed, one can only imagine how many have been compromised across the nation.”

The report comes after an increase in the number of digital attacks on public and private institutions in recent years; in mid-March, Chinese hackers infiltrated United States government systems to obtain information on federal employees, officials said. And in 2011, Sony‘s popular PlayStation Network for gamers was repeatedly the target of hackers, exposing the names, email addresses and user names of millions of customers.

In 2013, intrusions in New York were largely driven by two high-profile hacks, the report said: the huge breach at Target, in which millions of credit card numbers, addresses and phone numbers were stolen, as well as an attack on LivingSocial, a site for deals and discounts.

The report said that other businesses, of all sizes, also had experienced data breaches, including those in the financial and health services industries."

Drug monitoring programs, whose procedures and powers can vary significantly from state to state, all share a similar strategy: to require doctors, pharmacists or both to enter all prescriptions into a database that can — or, in some states, must — be consulted later to make sure patients do not get excess medication.

Because many states’ programs appear effective, Missouri has been urged to put one into effect. Among those calling for a change are Missouri medical associations, members of Congress from neighboring states, the White House and even Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, the St. Louis-based manufacturer of oxycodone, the highly abused prescription painkiller.

But while proponents say the vast majority of the Legislature supports the measure, it has been blocked by a small group of lawmakers led by State Senator Rob Schaaf, a family physician who argues that allowing the government to keep prescription records violates personal privacy. After successfully sinking a 2012 version of the bill, Mr. Schaaf said of drug abusers, “If they overdose and kill themselves, it just removes them from the gene pool.”

“There’s some people who say you are causing people to die — but I’m not causing people to die. I’m protecting other people’s liberty,” Mr. Schaaf said in a recent interview in his Senate office. “Missouri needs to be the first state to resist, and the other states need to follow suit and protect the liberty of their own citizens.”

Mr. Schaaf’s steadfast opposition has come under sharp criticism from fellow Republicans, including a United States representative, Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, one of eight states on Missouri’s 1400-mile perimeter.

“It’s very selfish on Missouri’s part to hang their hat on this privacy matter,” Mr. Rogers said. “The rest of us suffer.”

As the debate continues, law enforcement officials in Scott County, in the state’s southeast corner, say their best weapon is a pharmacist who carries one.

Piecemeal Patterns

Mr. Logan is essentially Scott County’s prescription-drug monitoring program. If someone appears to be illegally deceiving doctors to receive overlapping prescriptions or a provider appears to be handing out far too many prescriptions, he phones local pharmacies and tries to piece together prescription logs himself. Law enforcement can request such records upon reasonable suspicion, but it is very difficult to assemble records from all pharmacies in the area and beyond, Mr. Logan said.

If a questionable pattern emerges, he informs the sheriff and helps investigate the case. If a customer tries to fill a clearly illicit prescription in Mr. Logan’s own pharmacy, he has been known to jump from behind the counter and arrest that person on the spot.

State monitoring systems primarily target opioid painkillers (such as oxycodone and hydrocodone) and tranquilizers (such as Xanax and Valium), which are controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration because of their potential for harmful abuse. Details can vary, but almost all states allow — or require — pharmacists to enter all filled prescriptions into the database, and then prescribers or pharmacists to review this history and decline to fill another if the log appears suspicious. Medicaid and insurance companies often deny multiple prescriptions, but abusers pay cash to avoid those safeguards.

Forty-eight states are currently operating prescription databases, and New Hampshire’s will go online this year.

States with the strictest requirements in their programs, like Kentucky, New York and Tennessee, have had prescriptions for various controlled substances decrease about 8 percent, according to the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Center of Excellence at Brandeis University, which monitors and advises the programs. Much of the drop appears to come from deterring doctor shoppers: People getting prescriptions from at least five doctors and filling prescriptions from at least five pharmacies declined 75 percent in New York in 2013, when its program began.

No database was available this year in Sikeston, when a resident named Casie Hammon visited a doctor and left with her third painkiller prescription from him in nine days. The office assistant approached the physician and was told that Ms. Hammon reported an allergic reaction to one of the medications. Suspecting that Ms. Hammon was being untruthful and getting additional prescriptions elsewhere, but having no way to explore this, the assistant called Mr. Logan.

Mr. Logan called several pharmacies and determined that in the previous 10 weeks, Ms. Hammon had been prescribed, from three doctors, 171 total days’ worth of hydrocodone, and 140 days’ worth of tramadol and Percocet, other painkillers. He suspected that she was either selling them or taking dangerous amounts herself.

(Ms. Hammon and her lawyer did not respond to multiple phone and email requests for comment. Details of her case were drawn from public records and a reporter for The New York Times was present on the day of these events. Ms. Hammon has not entered a plea and is to be arraigned in August, the police said.)

While Mr. Logan cobbled together more prescription records, a county detective, Branden Caid, located Ms. Hammon in her S.U.V. Wearing a red T-shirt and jeans, she stood outside a police car and watched Detective Caid and another officer remove from her gold lamé purse about a dozen prescription bottles, some of them empty. Mr. Logan chatted with Ms. Hammon’s young children in the back seat to distract them from the scene.

“I’ve never been in trouble,” Ms. Hammon said as she was placed in a police car and driven 18 miles to the sheriff’s office. She was arrested on charges that she fraudulently attempted to obtain a controlled substance, a Class D felony.

“This all could have been saved with three taps on a computer,” Mr. Logan said as he trailed her. “This goes on for no reason.”

Destination for Abusers

Data suggest that Missouri has become targeted by out-of-state drug seekers. A report by ExpressScripts, which processes prescriptions for 90 million Americans, found that residents of its eight neighboring states travel into Missouri to fill their prescriptions much more often than Missourians fill theirs elsewhere — possibly indicating a desire to avoid those states’ drug monitoring programs, a company spokesman said.

Bob Twillman, the deputy executive director of the American Academy of Pain Management, said of the trend: “I’ve told legislators that I know they want to increase tourism, but not this kind of tourism.”

At Mission Missouri, a drug-treatment center a few miles from Mr. Logan’s pharmacy, Michael Foley, 28, recounted how he had routinely driven his black Chevy truck from his home in northern Arkansas — which instituted a prescription database in 2011 — into Missouri to visit doctors and complain of back pain. Those doctors “would pretty much just ask me what I wanted, no questions asked,” he said. On one such trip a few years ago, he carried more than 1,000 pills back to Arkansas, took some himself and sold the rest over three days for more than $7,500.

Two hours north in St. Louis, a mother who said she makes more than $200,000 a year said she has doctor shopped for Vicodin, tramadol and hydrocodone for eight years, and recently went through 30 days’ worth in three days. She said that like many painkiller addicts, she received the medication for a legitimate injury, enjoyed its euphoric effects, took it for longer than her pain truly required and found herself unable to break the habit.

“I’m not a junkie on the corner — I’m the one the program is designed to stop,” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “If I couldn’t get the pills in the first place, I’d have to stop. But it’s too easy this way.”

But many citizens oppose a prescription database. Sitting in Mr. Logan’s pharmacy after picking up a form of hydrocodone, Kathleen Secoy explained why.

“I’m not ashamed of having to take a pain pill, and I shouldn’t be treated like I’m doing anything wrong,” said Ms. Secoy, 61, a Charleston resident. “You can’t carry a gun without the government knowing. They know your Social Security number. They have access to enough of it as it is.”

These are among the citizens whose privacy rights Mr. Schaaf, four hours away in the Jefferson City Statehouse, said he is protecting. He cited several breaches of government-held data — including Edward Snowden’s release of classified National Security Agency documents and the hacking of a Utah health database in 2012 — and said that an online prescription database would be subject to similar mishandling.

One of Mr. Schaaf’s handful of Senate allies, Ed Emery, offered a different solution to the state’s prescription drug problems.

“We need to rebuild families,” Mr. Emery said in a telephone interview.

Back at the Precinct

In an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, Ms. Hammon sobbed as she spoke with a detective inside the Scott County sheriff’s office interview room.

She explained that scoliosis kept her in pain and that surgery a few months before made her need more and more relief. She described how she visited several doctors for extra painkiller prescriptions, but said that she did not know that was illegal. Asked if she was addicted to the medications, she said, “Not really.”

“I would like to get off of them,” she said, “because this is not worth it.”

While Detective Caid sorted through more empty bottles and pharmacy receipts, Sheriff Rick Walter watched Ms. Hammon on two monitors and became convinced that she was not selling her pills, but taking them herself.

Sheriff Walter said that his small force, even with an armed pharmacist like Mr. Logan, was simply outmanned to deter the drug abuse already occurring in Scott County, and that cases like Ms. Hammon’s would increase if Missouri did not get a database.

“I understand what they’re saying about privacy, I really do,” Sheriff Walter said. “But look at this — this is just one woman, one family. Those kids, they’re wondering where Mama is tonight. She’s hooked on painkillers, because the system allowed her to be.”"

Many former patients “have dropped out of the medical system,” he said, adding that they now refuse to see doctors or take their children to pediatricians out of mistrust.

The civil suit charged the hospital with invasion of privacy, emotional distress and negligence in its oversight of Dr. Levy, who practiced in a community clinic in East Baltimore run by the giant hospital system.

In a statement on Monday, the hospital said it hoped that the settlement, along with law enforcement findings that the images were not shared, “helps those affected achieve a measure of closure.”

The statement from the hospital, one of the nation’s leading academic centers of medicine and a large community health care provider, added: “We assure you that one individual does not define Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins is defined by the tens of thousands of employees who come to work determined to provide world-class care for our patients and their families.”

Initially, the hospital identified nearly 12,700 patients Dr. Levy might have seen in his 25 years as an employee. Investigators estimated that he began recording patients with tiny cameras hidden in a pen or a key fob around 2005.

“Words cannot describe how deeply sorry we are for all this has affected,” two top officials of Johns Hopkins wrote to former patients last year. “We are terribly sorry this has happened and for the distress you must be feeling.”

After Dr. Levy’s colleague reported him, hospital security officers confronted him in his office, and he turned over several cameras. A hospital statement at the time said that he was told to seek counseling and was escorted off the premises. Johns Hopkins contacted the Baltimore police and fired the doctor on Feb. 8, 2013.

Although law enforcement agencies concluded that Dr. Levy had not uploaded any of the images online or shared them with others, Mr. Schochor is not so sure. He cited retired F.B.I. experts whom he hired as consultants for the lawsuit. “I think there’s overwhelming probability” that Dr. Levy shared images, Mr. Schochor said.

His law firm, Schochor, Federico & Staton, which specializes in medical malpractice, interviewed about 2,000 former patients. He said many of the women described disturbances in work and their personal lives after learning of the recordings.

“There’s been a huge, devastating result to this whole thing,” Mr. Schochor said. “Many have had changes in their ability to focus, problems with sleeplessness. Some have had changes in their relationships with spouses and significant others.”

James A. Wells, the chairman of a medicine and law committee for the American Bar Association, said $190 million was “a very large number for the settlement of medical malpractice claims involving a single physician.”

Other cases involving doctors who secretly recorded patients have also drawn big payouts, though somewhat less than the Hopkins settlement. The case of an endocrinologist in Connecticut who took nude pictures and abused a series of children, for example, was settled for about $50 million in 2012.

If the Hopkins settlement receives final approval by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, each plaintiff will be reviewed individually to determine their share of the damages, including being interviewed and having their medical records examined.

As for the lawyer’s share, Mr. Schochor said that was up to the court to decide."

Soon after the financial crisis hit, the Obama administration decided to toss into the economic stimulus package a carrot to accelerate the computerization of health care. Within the roughly $800 billion pump-priming project, the health technology initiative could be seen as a modest down payment on the future: about $20 billion in incentives spread over several years to encourage doctors and hospitals to move from paper records into the computer age. The Bush administration had championed the cause, and, seizing a crisis-created opportunity, the Obama administration put up the money.

But ever since, the government-promoted drive for electronic health records has been assailed as everything from a handout to greedy tech companies to the advance guard of socialist medicine. In an editorial in February 2009, The Wall Street Journal called the program a “stalking horse for government-run health care.” Forecasts and studies of the impact of the incentive program have been similarly varied. Some predicted big dollar savings and improved care, while others came to the opposite conclusion, seeing higher costs and medical errors induced by complex technology.

At first glance, a new research paper, published in this month’s issue of Health Affairs, only adds to the confusion. The research paper found no evidence that hospitals adopting electronic health records were systematically using them to drive up their billings. The research by Julia Adler-Milstein, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, and Ashish K. Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, would seem to contradict an analysis done in 2012 by The New York Times and a similar one by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative journalism group. Both those analyses found higher costs for Medicare patients at hospitals using electronic health records.

In an interview, Dr. Jha said his research with Ms. Adler-Milstein did not refute the findings of The Times and the Center for Public Integrity. Certainly, Dr. Jha said, there were cases of doctors, nurses and clinic assistants using the automated point-and-click and cut-and-paste features of computerized health records to change the billing codes for treatment to patients and to charge more. But the new research, Dr. Jha said, covered a broader slice of data, including inpatient hospital billing as well as the emergency room reimbursements that, along with visits to doctors’ offices, were the main focus of the Times analysis.

The research with Ms. Adler-Milstein, he noted, also included a control group to adjust for factors like digital-record users being more likely to be larger institutions and teaching hospitals, which are more effective at billing and may be sent more seriously ill patients.

The researchers did not find systematic higher Medicare billing in hospitals that was attributable to electronic health records. “The bottom line,” Dr. Jha said, “is we didn’t see it.”

The Health Affairs article refers to the Times analysis, which “pointed to an association between E.H.R.s and higher payments” as helping to fuel concern about the potential for fraud and abuse. Dr. Jha said the Times analysis also prompted his research with Ms. Adler-Milstein — to look for how widespread the problem might be, or not.

Dr. Jha said he was surprised they did not find systemic higher billing, but Ms. Adler-Milstein, a former graduate student of his at Harvard, said she was not. Her assumption, she said, was rooted in simple economics. Hospitals in general operate on slender profit margins, she observed, so “lots of resources are devoted to maximizing coding using all available information in the paper or electronic record.”

The concerns raised have also brought government scrutiny to the potential for using digital technology to overbill and inflate costs.

Dr. Jha has been studying the impact of digital health records for years. A research paper he published in late 2009, as the federal government was about to embark on the incentive program, cast doubt on how much hospitals that had already adopted electronic health records had achieved lower costs and improved care.

Today, Dr. Jha says he remains skeptical. Some things have changed markedly. In 2008, 9.4 percent of the nation’s hospitals were using basic electronic health records, according to the American Hospital Association. By 2013, the percentage had soared to 59.4 percent, propelled by the federal incentive program.

“So far,” Dr. Jha said, “we’ve mostly spent a lot of money to transition from paper to electronic records.”

No one thinks a modern health care system can cling to paper records. But the policy goal of the federal incentive program was to use digital technology to curb costs and improve care. The legislation was called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. And there are examples of health care providers that use digital patient records effectively — mostly large medical groups, like Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and the Marshfield Clinic, that have worked with the technology for years.

But Dr. Jha said there was “certainly not yet” evidence of a payoff nationally from the federal incentive program.

That is hardly surprising. The economic dividend from any technology, from steam power to the electric engine to the computer, takes time to appear, as people figure out how to make the best use of the new tool. In 1987, when the personal computer revolution was more than a decade along, Robert M. Solow, a winner of the Nobel in economic science, mordantly observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” By the 1990s, the impact on productivity became evident.

The principle of the technology-payoff time lag is true in many industries. But in health care, there is a case for special vigilance as well as for patience. The more digital patient records and decision-support software become part of diagnosis and treatment, the higher the stakes: In health information technology, there are no clinical trials or tests with randomized controls, as there are for drugs, for example. True, digital data does not go into the body, but it can increasingly guide what does.

That is why the Food and Drug Administration, in cooperation with the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Federal Communications Commission, is developing what the government calls a “risk-based regulatory framework” for digital health technology. It is also a reason Dr. Jha says he believes the federal incentive program, which got under way in earnest in 2011, will be stretched out to eight or 10 years rather than the five years of the original plan."

Several of Medicare’s other top prescribers of Acthar have blemishes on their records. For example, the Michigan neurologist Gavin Awerbuch, the most frequent prescriber of the drug in 2011, was charged in May with health care fraud and distributing a controlled substance. He has not yet entered a plea. He could not be reached, and his lawyer did not return phone calls and emails.

The neurologist Sean Orr, who has given promotional talks for the drug but was not a top prescriber, had his medical license suspended last year by Florida, which determined that he had sex with a patient. A civil whistle-blower lawsuit filed in 2012 in United States District Court in Jacksonville, Fla., also accuses Dr. Orr of misdiagnosing healthy patients with neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, so he could bill for their treatment and prescribe expensive medications. That lawsuit is pending. He could not be reached for comment.

Questcor declined to answer questions for this article. Its public relations firm issued a statement saying that Questcor’s promotional activities were “in line with industry best practices” and that it adhered to federal standards.

ProPublica has reported previously on ties between Medicare’s top prescribers of expensive drugs and the makers of those drugs. A 2007 report in The New York Times examined the relationship between drug company payments to psychiatrists in Minnesota and prescriptions of antipsychotic drugs for children in the Medicaid program.

Last year, ProPublica reporters identified the drugs that were most actively promoted to doctors in 2010 and 2011 using rankings from Cegedim Strategic Data, a company that tracks marketing expenses. Seventeen of the top 20 Medicare prescribers of the blood pressure drug Bystolic in 2010 received speaking payments from Forest Laboratories, the company that makes it. Nine of the top 10 prescribers of the Alzheimer’s drug Exelon received money from Novartis, the drug’s maker. And eight of the top 10 for Johnson & Johnson painkiller Nucynta were paid speakers."

Community Health Systems, a publicly traded hospital operator based in Franklin, Tenn., said that personal data, including names, Social Security numbers and addresses, for 4.5 million patients had been compromised in a Chinese cyberattack on its systems from April to June.

The company, which operates 206 hospitals in 29 states, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that that the attackers had bypassed its security systems and stolen data that also included birth dates and telephone numbers for the patients, who had been referred to or treated by doctors affiliated with the company over the last five years.

The company is required to notify affected patients and agencies under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects such personal data.

Community Health Systems engaged Mandiant, a subsidiary of FireEye, the Milpitas, Calif. computer security company, to conduct forensics on the attack. Mandiant said it believed the attackers were part of an advanced group based in China that typically steals valuable intellectual property, such as medical device and equipment development data. Instead, the criminals took nonmedical data. The hospital operator noted that no patient credit-card, medical or clinical information had been taken.

The company confirmed the hack in July and said it had eradicated the attackers’ malware from its systems and increased its computer defenses to prevent future attacks. The company said it would be providing identity theft protection to affected patients and carried cyber insurance to mitigate some of its losses.

Security experts have long predicted that the digitization of medical records would invite hackers. Last year, Stephen Cobb, a senior researcher at ESET, the antivirus company, calculated that 24,800 Americans had protected health information exposed — per day — in 2013, based on the number of breaches disclosed on the website of the Health and Human Services Department last year.

Including the breach at Community Health Systems, six million Americans have had personally identifiable data compromised in 2014, according to the agency’s website, which only lists breaches that have affected more than 500 patients."

Her case illustrates what outside experts and dozens of current and former military hospital workers interviewed by The New York Times call a signal failing in a system that cares for 1.35 million active-duty service members and their families, among others.

Put simply, they say, many of the hospitals are so small and the trickle of patients so thin that it compromises the ability of doctors and nurses to capably diagnose and treat serious illnesses, much less take on surgeries like Mrs. Smith’s.

Two-thirds of the hospitals last year served 30 or fewer inpatients a day — less than a third as many as the typical civilian hospital. Nine served 10 or fewer — so few that Dr. Lucian L. Leape, a leading patient-safety expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, said, “I think they should be outlawed.”

These small and underused hospitals are the focus of an evolving Pentagon plan to scale back the system — entirely separate from the scandal-plagued veterans health system — by converting some of them into either outpatient clinics or birthing centers. The downsizing plan has not been made public, but Winn was among the hospitals listed in a draft distributed internally last spring and obtained by The Times.

The backdrop for the downsizing is a fiscal crisis. Four years ago, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said health care costs were “eating the Defense Department alive”; last year, they represented almost 10 percent of the defense budget. Close to half of the beds in military hospitals appear to sit vacant, significantly more than the civilian hospital average.

Behind those fiscal woes, though, is a hospital system at odds with itself, struggling with conflicting missions that, according to many people interviewed, put not just the Pentagon’s coffers but the quality of care and patient safety at risk.

Pentagon health leaders say their hospitals’ paramount mission is military: to hone the skills that doctors and nurses will need in the carnage of combat. But their principal business is both broader and more mundane: They are essentially community hospitals, providing a smorgasbord of low-cost primary and specialty care, from births to breast implants to appendectomies.

Especially, but not only, at smaller hospitals, the military priorities undercut the day-to-day delivery of health care, doctors and nurses say.

Inexperienced doctors often assume outsize responsibilities because military policies encourage more experienced and ambitious clinicians to become administrators. Continuity, so crucial to medical care, is lost as hospital commanders and doctors, as well as patients, constantly rotate from post to post. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken an especially heavy toll: With many military doctors and nurses overseas, hospitals have been forced to shunt patients to civilian care, leaving empty beds and out-of-practice medical staffs.

Resistance to Proposed Cuts

To some veterans of the system, the inherent incongruities raise the question of whether, with limited exceptions, the military should even be in the hospital business.

“It’s a dangerous game,” said John Schafer, who served for eight years as deputy commander for clinical operations at Reynolds Army Community Hospital at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. “It is crazy that the military doesn’t say, hey, we are really good at outpatient medicine and this inpatient thing is out of our league.”

In February, Mr. Schafer left to become senior director of physician services at Comanche County Memorial Hospital, a 380-bed facility nearby. From his office, he can see the military hospital, which treats an average of just 13 patients a day.

“I loved that place,” he said. “But it should not be a hospital. I retired because I could see the unsafe care. Nobody was listening.”

Since late May, partly in response to months of inquiries from The Times, the Pentagon has been conducting a systemwide review of quality of care, patient safety and access to treatment. That report is expected soon, but hints of concern emerge from the draft downsizing plan. It warned that many military doctors, including general surgeons, were not busy enough to keep their skills sharp, and stated that medical literature demonstrated that bigger hospitals offered better care than smaller ones.

A Pentagon spokeswoman said that a review of some data did not find that the military’s smaller hospitals performed worse than its bigger hospitals. But in an interview, Dr. Jonathan Woodson, the Pentagon’s top health care official, said officials had to consider quality of care, along with cost and other factors, in deciding whether to downgrade a hospital with a low volume of patients.

Assessing the performance of the system’s diverse array of hospitals is difficult, largely because the Pentagon either does not collect or does not rigorously analyze some crucial data. What is more, some hospitals have too few patients to be measured on certain benchmarks of care.

In correspondence with The Times about their experiences at military hospitals, some patients praised their care, while others called it substandard. The most recent available data also highlight wide variations in the quality of two major realms of treatment — maternity care and surgery.

Compared with leading civilian hospitals, more than half of domestic military hospitals — including the five with the busiest maternity wards — performed poorly on one or more measures of harm to mothers or babies in 2011 and 2012. As The Times previously reported, half of the military hospitals whose surgical data are submitted for outside review had higher than expected rates of surgical complications.

Dr. Woodson, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, has called for better, safer care of maternity, surgical and other patients. “The people we serve expect us to improve,” he said in a message to military health care workers this summer.

Discussing the cutback plans in a recent interview, he said that the military needed its own hospitals, but not as many.

“There will always be a need for a military health care system,” Dr. Woodson said. “We will always need platforms to train our people.” Nonetheless, he said, “Where we have hospitals was decided decades ago.”

As in the past, this latest effort to alter those decisions has begun to provoke resistance from the armed services and Congress. Already, the Pentagon has cut its downsizing list from 15 hospitals to eight. Even that outcome is in doubt.

Winn, where Irene Smith began her medical odyssey, was given a reprieve.

Mrs. Smith still receives some care there, for insurance reasons. At home, a short drive from the military base, she sleeps sitting up, propped up by pillows, in a downstairs bedroom. She struggles to climb the stairs. She can’t go to the grocery store alone because she can’t lift the bags. She cannot imagine who would employ her now.

“There is not a single day that goes by that I am not in pain,” said Mrs. Smith, whose husband served 16 years in six combat zones before he was discharged for medical reasons. “I want people to know how the military is treating the families of the soldiers who go overseas to fight. They are using us as guinea pigs.”

Competing Missions

The military hospital system is actually less a system than a collection of hospitals that, with a few exceptions, are run separately by the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. Its flagship is the sprawling and sophisticated Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the Washington suburbs, but more typical are small hospitals like Winn and Reynolds. The military also operates 14 hospitals overseas.

The system reached its peak size during World War II and has been shrinking in fits and starts ever since. The competing missions remain, encapsulated in two striking statistics:

Only one domestic hospital — the San Antonio Military Medical Center, the system’s largest — operates a Level 1 trauma unit, where doctors and nurses see cases similar to those they would encounter in war zones, according to the Pentagon’s analysis.

At the same time, one of the military’s busiest medical practices is a staple of civilian health care — delivering babies, about 50,000 a year.

In the interviews, dozens of former and current medical staff members described how military prerogatives constantly challenged the quality of care.

The military insists that most hospital supervisors be military officers, even though civilians make up almost half of the staff. As more seasoned military doctors move up to desk jobs, junior physicians sometimes end up heading clinical departments just months after completing their residencies, doctors and nurses say.

“Our young docs don’t have senior docs mentoring them,” said Michael E. Menning, a health care administrator who retired from the Air Force in 2009 after 24 years. “We have orthopedic surgeons, brain surgeons, thoracic surgeons, urologists, all in administrative jobs.”

Partly out of frustration with the promotion system, most military doctors take civilian jobs soon after they have paid back in years of service what they owe for free medical education or training, according to two military personnel experts with the RAND Corporation, a research organization.

The attrition adds to the continuous flux created by the military’s rigid rotation policies. Like other military personnel, enlisted doctors and nurses — even chief medical officers or heads of nursing — typically move every few years. Army hospitals get a new commander every two years.

“You are constantly losing momentum, constantly losing traction, and that relates directly to patient safety and quality of care,” said one former hospital commander, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “What civilian health organization rotates their C.E.O. every two years? There is no continuity, no institutional memory.”

In the civilian world, hospital executives typically hold graduate degrees in business or health care management and are certified by a professional board, according to a report last year overseen by the RAND Corporation. By contrast, in 2012, fewer than half of Army hospitals were run by health care administrators. The rest were in the hands of doctors, nurses and a dentist, the report said.

“Health care is complex,” said Mr. Schafer, the former Fort Sill official. “This idea that the Army has that anybody can do it once you get promoted to colonel is ridiculous.”

Air Force hospitals were run by physicians whose formal preparation consisted of a two-week seminar, the report said. “They are filling the job of a hospital administrator with zero professional training except for that two-week course,” Colonel Menning said. “They are sharp docs, but they are not qualified to be running these hospitals.”

Since the last round of hospital closings, in 2005, wartime has further strained military care. Many patients had to be referred out of the system; others left of their own accord. That choice is reflected in survey after survey showing military beneficiaries more satisfied with civilian than military care, by margins of more than 20 percent.

Of the 8.2 million people whose health care was covered by the Defense Department last year, including military retirees who served more than 20 years and their families, only about 2.4 million were treated exclusively at military hospitals and clinics. And more than half of those were active-duty service members, who were required to use military care when available.

Some former high-ranking defense health officials argue that the military health care model no longer makes much sense.

“In general, I don’t think we should be running hospitals where other resources exist,” said Harold Koenig, who as surgeon general of the Navy in the mid-1990s oversaw its arm of the hospital network. “We can get our providers on the staffs of civilian hospitals.”

Research comparing the cost of military and civilian care is not conclusive, but the Pentagon’s own draft study argues that, on average, civilian care is actually cheaper, in part because the military’s hospitals are so underused. So even as it seeks to downsize, the Pentagon is also trying to recapture lost patients, especially at the larger hospitals.

“Patients have choices,” Dr. Woodson said last fall. “We need to be their provider of choice.”

In recent months, the military has ordered tens of thousands of beneficiaries accustomed to civilian care to switch to a primary-care doctor at a military hospital or clinic — or pay more out of pocket for insurance that covers civilian care.

But already, nurses at some major hospitals are complaining that the growing workloads threaten the quality of care. At Madigan Army Medical Center outside Tacoma, Wash., some medical workers have relayed their concerns to the Joint Commission, an independent body that accredits hospitals.

There are similar complaints at Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where poor surgical infection controls temporarily jeopardized the hospital’s accreditation and led to repeated inspections this year by the Joint Commission. Several staff members, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation, said the hospital had been forced to expand its pool of eligible patients by more than 8 percent while cutting its budget and civilian staff. In an internal memo to public affairs officers this summer, Pentagon officials said staffing cuts have not undermined patient safety or quality of care.

Matthew McLean, an Army diesel sergeant who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, shifted his family to civilian care years ago.

In October 2007, his wife, April, then 25 and seven months into a high-risk pregnancy, went for a checkup at the Reynolds Army hospital at Fort Sill. According to her malpractice claim, nurses lost track of her baby’s heart rate for nearly an hour, but failed to recognize the unfolding emergency.

The head of the obstetrics and gynecology unit — a military doctor who had completed her residency just five months earlier — said she wanted to transfer Mrs. McLean to a civilian hospital better able to handle the situation, according to the couple. Before that could happen, the baby died.

In a meeting two weeks later with the hospital commander, Sergeant McLean said, he demanded to know why the obstetrician had not performed a cesarean section. “These were his exact words,” the sergeant recalled: “ ‘If we tried to do a C-section for every baby that went into distress, there would be no babies delivered vaginally.’ ” The government settled the couple’s malpractice claim for $250,000.

Sergeant McLean, who has been transferred repeatedly since then, must seek military health care if available. “As a result,” he said, “I go to the doctor very, very, very rarely.

“But my wife and my children, I pay out of pocket to send them off-post to a civilian doctor. I absolutely refuse, refuse to let them be seen by a military doctor ever again.”

‘Very Scary’ for Doctors

On his first day at Naval Hospital Lemoore in February 2010, Dr. James Verrees said, he warned a Navy captain that the hospital’s defibrillator was malfunctioning.

“He nodded and smiled,” he recalled.

Photo

That was an early indication, Dr. Verrees said, of the culture of complacency he found during his three years as staff obstetrician at the 22-bed hospital outside Fresno, Calif., which last year averaged just four inpatients a day.

Doctors’ pagers did not work, he said. A maternity unit nurse assigned to listen for alarms on fetal heartbeat monitors had a hearing impairment. Lab results could not be trusted.

But when he complained about the persistent lab errors at a staff meeting, he said, he was ordered to apologize in writing to the entire staff. “People notice that something is wrong, and they are told to mind their own business,” Dr. Verrees said.

Precisely how that affected Lemoore patients is hard to discern. Rates of death and readmission are the broadest gauges of hospital performance, but the military’s data make it impossible to judge individual hospitals by those measures. Some hospitals treat many more seriously ill patients than others, but the military does not adjust its statistics to reflect those differences. Nor does it track how many patients die after last-minute transfers to civilian care.

Even so, Dr. Verrees and another former Lemoore physician, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of career repercussions, said they found Lemoore’s record troubling. Case records, malpractice suits and interviews show a string of grievous outcomes in the six-year period ending last summer.

A 7-week-old died of congestive heart failure last year after what her parents described as delays and equipment difficulties at Lemoore. A 30-year-old woman was forced to undergo a hysterectomy that same year after suffering severe bleeding during an emergency cesarean section that lacerated her bladder and vagina. An active-duty servicewoman died in 2009 after medical workers missed the signs of necrotizing fasciitis, a dangerous bacterial infection. A retired officer died of appendicitis in 2007, two days after being told he had a hernia.

And shortly before that, Raquel Bradshaw, the wife of a Navy officer, lost her 6-year old son, Kristian.

The first grader had been admitted to Lemoore for five days for gastroenteritis and dehydration. A month later, Mrs. Bradshaw took him back twice in two days because he could not stop vomiting.

“I kept telling the doctor, this is not normal,” Mrs. Bradshaw said. “She told me to give him Gatorade.”

The third morning, Kristian collapsed unconscious at home. He was sped by ambulance to a nearby civilian hospital. He died of dehydration due to gastroenteritis — an outcome that experts say is vanishing in a nation with advanced medical care.

A Stanford University specialist in emergency medicine, who reviewed the case record, said mistakes in Kristian’s care at Lemoore “directly led to his death.” The government paid $250,000 for malpractice, the maximum allowed by California law, the family’s lawyer, C. Brooks Cutter, said.

“I just feel they screwed up completely,” Mrs. Bradshaw said.

According to Dr. Verrees, doctors and nurses at Lemoore were “scared to admit patients because they thought they would have a disaster.”

“They would say, ‘Send people to the real hospital,’ ” he said, referring to a 142-bed civilian facility about 30 minutes away. “My thought was, if that is the real hospital, why do we keep this facility open?”

At some other small military hospitals, even senior staff members say they have repeatedly asked themselves the same question. “If you are a physician, it’s very scary,” said Mr. Schafer, the former deputy commander at Reynolds. “You decide you are going to admit your sick patient, but there is no I.C.U., no gastroenterologist, no pulmonologist, no pathologist. Nobody’s on call.”

But convincing hospital commanders of such hazards is another matter, he said, because they do not want their brief tenures to be marked by cuts in services. “They want to hold on to everything,” he said.

So do some higher-ups in the Pentagon’s health care bureaucracy. Faced with objections from the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, the Pentagon has backed away, at least for now, from downgrading seven of the 15 hospitals on its initial list. And that is far from the last word: The defense budget bill due to come before the Senate later this year includes a demand for an outside review that would prevent the Pentagon from streamlining the system for months to come, at least.

Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital in western Louisiana illustrates the obstacles ahead. The 20-bed facility averages just 10 inpatients and two births a day. It also reports one of the military’s highest rates of mothers who hemorrhage after childbirth, a leading cause of maternal deaths. Pentagon and Army officials agreed this year that it should be turned into an outpatient clinic, according to the draft report.

But Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, a Democrat, is fighting hard to postpone the changes, as is the local chamber of commerce. “The off-base hospitals cannot absorb the patient load,” said Michael D. Reese, the chamber’s president.

So far, Lemoore is the only hospital on the Pentagon’s list to convert to an outpatient clinic, according to Pentagon officials. In an interview, Rear Adm. C. Forrest Faison III, the Navy’s deputy surgeon general, said nearby civilian hospitals did not exist when Lemoore was built in 1961 but now can pick up inpatient care.

The Pentagon’s public affairs memo states that any cuts stem from insufficient demand, not “safety or quality issues.” Pentagon officials said privacy rules prohibited them from commenting on the treatment of individual patients.

The Navy is in the process of limiting a second hospital at Oak Harbor, Wash., to outpatient and maternity care. Two more hospitals — Reynolds and Beaufort Naval Hospital in South Carolina — closed their emergency departments but still offer inpatient care. The other four — Bayne-Jones and Army base hospitals at Fort Knox in Kentucky, Fort Jackson in South Carolina and Fort Riley in Kansas — remain untouched.

Winn, 45 minutes from Savannah, Ga., was originally marked for cutbacks, including a halt to inpatient surgery. But the Army won more time to show that a full range of inpatient care was needed.

Since then, said one medical worker who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, doctors and nurses have come under pressure to admit patients who might otherwise have been referred to civilian care or treated as outpatients.

Like Dr. Verrees at Lemoore and Mr. Schafer at Reynolds, some Winn staff members are worried about the quality of care. They also believe that their concerns have not been heard. So, earlier this summer, several of them went over the hospital commander’s head and wrote anonymously to leading defense health officials, complaining about the treatment of several patients.

Among the patients discussed was Ibraham Torres, a 25-year-old soldier who died last December. In the letter, the medical workers asserted that Winn had waited too long to airlift Mr. Torres to a civilian hospital, acting only after he had a series of cardiac arrests.

Mr. Torres’s mother, Susana, said in an interview that “there was nothing they could do” at the civilian hospital. She said a military officer promised an inquiry, but warned her not to expect results for a year and a half.

“I never got a real explanation of what happened,” she said.

Lapses in Analysis

Winn conducted 4,457 surgeries last year. But the Pentagon submits surgical data for outside evaluation from only 17 of its largest hospitals, and Winn is not among them. So it was unclear if what happened to Mrs. Smith, the hernia patient, was a horrific exception or part of a pattern of poor surgical care.

An initial operation to repair a hiatal hernia, like Mrs. Smith’s, does not necessarily require a specialist, according to Dr. Carlos A. Pellegrini, an expert in gastrointestinal surgery at the University of Washington Medical Center. Although the procedure — called laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication — is considered advanced, he said, a general surgeon can perform it with proper training.

Mrs. Smith’s first operation in September 2007, conducted by a general surgeon at Winn, went smoothly enough. But within nine months, the hernia had re-emerged. That is not uncommon, Dr. Pellegrini said, but a second repair is far more complex and “the province of the specialist.” Among other concerns, he said, the chances of injuring the patient’s stomach or esophagus rise significantly.

Dr. Charles H. Penn — a general surgeon — performed the second hernia repair in May 2008. Beforehand, Mrs. Smith said, he informed her that the second surgery would be riskier, but did not refer her to a specialist or discuss whether civilian care was an option. In his surgical notes, he wrote that during a “very difficult” procedure, he identified and sealed a perforation in Mrs. Smith’s stomach. Mrs. Smith later charged in a malpractice suit that Dr. Penn himself had perforated her stomach and after repairing it, failed to conduct a standard test to make sure he had succeeded.

Dr. Penn was off for the Memorial Day weekend, so Dr. Stephen W. Jarrard, another general surgeon who had completed his residency just three years before, took over Mrs. Smith’s care, according to the lawsuit. Returning to find Mrs. Smith in distress, Dr. Penn discovered a hole in her stomach during emergency exploratory surgery and removed part of the organ.

But Mrs. Smith continued to decline for six more days, battling infection and respiratory distress. She was hooked up to a ventilator, given a tracheotomy and finally — 13 days after Dr. Penn first operated — flown by helicopter to the Memorial University Medical Center in Savannah, where surgeons found her abdomen filled with murky brown fluid and pus.

They operated eight times in 11 days, and while they saved her life, they were finally forced to remove the rest of her stomach and connect her esophagus directly to her intestines. She remained at Memorial for seven weeks, much of the time so heavily sedated that she was barely conscious.

According to Mrs. Smith’s lawyer, Wilbur D. Owens III, government lawyers conceded that Dr. Jarrard had failed to recognize the postoperative complications. Dr. Jarrard lost his credentials at Winn and left for civilian practice. He blamed “a biased and unfair peer review process” in his Georgia medical licensing records.

But the lawyers insisted that the rest of Mrs. Smith’s care met medical standards, according to Mr. Owens. Dr. Penn, who continues to practice surgery at Winn, did not return phone calls for comment.

If a patient unexpectedly dies or suffers permanent harm, as Mrs. Smith did, the case is considered a “sentinel event.” Pentagon regulations require such events be reported to the Joint Commission for follow-up. And they require that hospitals thoroughly investigate not just whether an individual doctor or nurse failed to provide proper care, but whether its own procedures were at fault.

The inquiry, called a “root cause analysis,” might have addressed whether surgeons at Winn should have attempted Mrs. Smith’s operation. But there is no record of one in her case.

As The Times reported in June, that is typical of military hospitals. In fact, newly obtained statistics show that last year, the government paid 21 military patients more than $500,000 each to settle malpractice claims, an indication of “significant harm.” Yet hospitals identified only three as sentinel events, a pattern that has persisted for years.

In the interview, Dr. Woodson, the Pentagon’s top health official, said doctors and other military hospital workers know their limits. “The services have done a very good job of ensuring that complex cases are done at the right place,” he said, and “that the level of surgeries is appropriate.”

Two and a half years after the government settled Mrs. Smith’s lawsuit for just under $1 million, Winn faces a similar claim: Jamie Knestaut, a soldier’s wife, has charged that a flawed operation by a different surgeon nearly reduced her to the same condition as Mrs. Smith.

And she arrived at much the same conclusion: The surgeon, she said in her complaint, “used me as his own personal guinea pig.”

Photo

In March of last year, Mrs. Knestaut, 40, underwent a sleeve gastrectomy — an elective laparoscopic operation to reduce the size of her stomach, which she hoped would reduce her medical risks from being overweight.

During 16 months of “hell and uncertainty” that followed, she said, she was readmitted to Winn seven times because contents from her stomach were seeping into her abdomen. For months, she said, she was fed through a tube.

After a prolonged fight, she said, she forced the hospital to transfer her to civilian care. In July, also at Memorial in Savannah, Mrs. Knestaut was operated on once more. She said her surgeon warned her that there was only a 10 percent chance of saving her stomach.

She was lucky; in his postoperative report, the surgeon wrote that after he cut away the leaking section of her stomach, he found plenty of healthy tissue left.

Nine days later, Mrs. Knestaut filed an administrative claim against the Army for medical malpractice, the first step toward a lawsuit. In a meeting this year with the hospital commander, she explained one reason.

“What about the next person?” she said."

In June of 2009, the doctor and writer Atul Gawande published a piece in The New Yorker called “The Cost Conundrum,” which examined why the small border city of McAllen, Tex., was the most expensive place for health care in the United States.

The article became mandatory reading in the White House. President Obama convened an Oval Office meeting to discuss its key finding that the high cost of health care in the country was directly tied to a system that rewarded the overuse of care. The president also brought up the article at a meeting with Democratic senators, emphasizing that McAllen represented the problem that needed to be fixed.

Five years later, the situation has changed. Where McAllen once illustrated the problem of American health care, the city is now showing us how the problem can be solved, largely because of the Affordable Care Act that Mr. Obama signed into law in 2010.

In his article, Dr. Gawande cited studies showing that patients in high-cost areas like the Rio Grande Valley, which includes McAllen, were much less likely to receive preventive services like cancer screenings or vaccines, but far more likely to be prescribed costly drugs, invasive procedures and expensive diagnostic tests. And they were not any healthier for it: Compared with places like El Paso, McAllen had worse health outcomes, despite spending twice as much per capita on Medicare.

The problem was that doctors in McAllen were responding to reimbursement incentives in the American health care system that rewarded activity rather than value. The more procedures and visits a doctor billed, the more he got paid."

Schools are increasingly using online learning technology. Advocates tout its use in tailoring lessons to each child’s pace and ability as a revolution in education.

But privacy advocates have warned that the vast amounts of personal data students generate with the products can be misused. California, for instance, is set to pass the first law prohibiting companies from selling students’ personal information or using it for marketing purposes.

Is the collection of data from schools an invasion of students’ privacy?"

This can be as seemingly trivial as a bag of bagels — all payments above $10 are included — or as lofty as a research grant. It also includes meals, travel expenses and speakers’ fees. Group-purchasing organizations, which serve as middlemen between health care providers and manufacturers, also must disclose doctors’ ownership and investment interests in their companies.

The data is likely to raise questions about doctors’ financial interests. Several studies and reports, including one by The New York Times, have shown that doctors with relationships to industry are more likely to prescribe expensive and potentially inappropriate drugs.

“When you look at why do drug companies and device companies make gifts and offer consulting payments and honoraria to physicians, the main goal is to influence prescribing practices,” said Dr. Michael Carome, the director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group. “The interest of those companies is to improve their financial bottom line, and not necessarily represent the best interest of patients.”

While some relationships may leave doctors open to scrutiny, other ties are important for innovation. Drug and device makers say they regularly consult with doctors to help them decide where the need is the greatest, and doctors conduct clinical trials that help get products approved.

Research, for example, accounted for nearly $1.5 billion of payments during the reporting period. Companies spent an additional $302 million on royalties and licenses, money that is paid to doctors and teaching hospitals for their role in developing companies’ products.

Royalties created lucrative relationships for doctors, particularly in fields that are highly dependent on medical devices. Dr. Steven S. Burkhart, a San Antonio orthopedic surgeon who has written a textbook for surgeons called “A Cowboy’s Companion,” received more than $7 million in royalties, travel expenses and speaking engagements, mostly from Arthrex, which makes supplies for orthopedic surgeries, during the reporting period. He did not return a call for comment.

Other orthopedic surgeons were also among the highest-paid doctors. Dr. Chitranja Ranawat, a Manhattan orthopedic surgeon, received nearly $4 million in payments from DePuy Synthes, the orthopedic unit of Johnson & Johnson.

Sometimes a large royalty payment contributed to the bulk of a company’s reported spending. Genentech, the United States division of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, reported $210.2 million in payments during the last five months of 2013, according to a company spokeswoman. Company officials said a large chunk of that total — $122.5 million — were royalty payments that went to the City of Hope, a California cancer hospital, for sales of several products, including the drugs Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin.

“We have very close relationships with physicians who use our devices in the field, and those physicians bring back valuable ideas and help us develop new improvements,” said Christopher L. White, general counsel of AdvaMed, an industry trade group for device makers.

Lucrative Relationships Pharmaceutical and medical device companies made payments of about $3.5 billion to doctors and other health care professionals in the five-month period from Aug. 1 to Dec. 31, 2013. PURPOSE AMOUNTS Research payments $1.49 billion Ownership interest 1.02 billion Speaking and consulting fees 380 million Royalties and licenses 302 million Travel, food, lodging 167 million Other 128 million $3.48 billion TOTAL

The website comes with significant caveats, in part because it is rather clunky. To look up an individual doctor, visitors to the home page had to click to another page, open a database and then scroll through an unwieldy series of data fields to view basic payment information.

The data is also incomplete. Besides the unidentified payments, companies were permitted to delay the release of information about research payments for products that haven’t been approved, or for new uses of existing products. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is overseeing the release, said about 190,000 research payments during the August-to-December 2013 period were not made public for this reason.

When the website went live, one large payment to a doctor, a Boston neurologist, turned out to be an error. The data showed that Dr. Reisa Sperling, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Harvard Medical School, received a payment from the drug company Boehringer Ingelheim totaling more than $155,000 for travel expenses in September of 2013. But Dr. Sperling said she only did a one-day consulting assignment for the company in Boston and was paid no more than $5,000.

A spokeswoman for Boehringer Ingelheim confirmed that the amount was incorrect.

Dr. Robert M. Wah, president of the American Medical Association, said his members had reported a variety of problems with the website; they were granted advance access to the data to verify its accuracy. Some had trouble logging on. Others found the information to be wrong.

Only about 26,000 health care professionals registered to check their information beforehand, out of about 546,000 in the database, officials said. The disclosure rules apply not just to medical doctors but also to dentists, chiropractors, podiatrists and optometrists who are legally authorized to practice.

Dr. Raed Dweik, a Cleveland Clinic lung specialist, said he was surprised to see that the drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim had reported that he had received a lunch worth about $50 during a presentation at the clinic. Dr. Dweik, who is chairman of the clinic’s conflict of interest committee, said he had spoken at the event but deliberately skipped the lunch. He said he believed the company simply divided the number of event participants by the cost of the meal and did not check who had attended the lunch. “I’m very sensitive about this,” Dr. Dweik said, adding that other drug companies had also previously marked him down for lunches he did not eat. “I make it clear ahead of time that I’m not doing it.”

Dr. Dweik said he disputed the payment with the federal government, and it does not appear in the database. His personal experience, he said, led him to warn other physicians at the Cleveland Clinic to scrutinize their records.

“I think the concept itself is really good,” he said.

However, “the problem with this website is one has no context,” he added. “You don’t know if this relationship is legitimate or not, and the bigger problem is the inaccuracies.”"

At least 130 doctors, out of about 32,000 named in the database, earned more than $100,000. The database did not include the names of about 40 percent of the payment records because the federal government is still trying to verify their accuracy.

Although the database also includes payments for research, royalties and other activities, ethicists particularly scrutinize the money doled out for speaking and consulting payments. They argue that these relationships can influence prescribing behavior and negatively affect patients, especially when such ties are lucrative.

“Social scientists will tell you that any amount of money will influence people, but I think larger sums can influence behavior more,” said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

The list of doctors who earned more than $100,000 in speaking and consulting fees includes practitioners of diverse backgrounds and interests who were paid by drug and device makers for a variety of reasons. Dr. David Kessler, who was the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s, was paid more than $200,000; the money, he said, was for serving on the board of Aptalis, a pharmaceutical company that is now owned by Actavis.

Some high-earning doctors were actually being paid for research, even though their fees were not recorded that way.

Still others are practicing physicians who maintain busy practices and earn a secondary income traveling the country — and sometimes the world — speaking and consulting for pharmaceutical and device companies. Dr. Geoffrey H. Westrich, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, received more than $247,000 from companies that make hip, knee and spine products, including more than $100,000 from Exactech, a maker of implant devices and other surgical materials. According to his website, Dr. Westrich performs hundreds of hip and knee replacements each year. An assistant in his office said he was in surgery and was not available for an interview.

Dr. James Januzzi Jr., a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, earned more than $328,000 for speaking and consulting assignments, mainly from the drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, according to the federal data. Dr. Januzzi did not return a call and email for comment. A spokesman for Massachusetts General said that the hospital has rigorous policies requiring disclosure and review of outside activities of its staff, and that it limits the types of outside activities that it permits.

Dr. Bradley Bengtson, a plastic surgeon in Grand Rapids, Mich., earned more than $300,000, mostly from Allergan, which makes a range of cosmetic surgery products, including Botox and a new breast implant, the Natrelle 410.

Lucrative Relationships Pharmaceutical and medical device companies made payments of about $3.5 billion to doctors and other health care professionals in the five-month period from Aug. 1 to Dec. 31, 2013. PURPOSE AMOUNTS Research payments $1.49 billion Ownership interest 1.02 billion Speaking and consulting fees 380 million Royalties and licenses 302 million Travel, food, lodging 167 million Other 128 million $3.48 billion TOTAL

During the five-month period covered by the new database, Dr. Bengtson traveled to San Diego, Las Vegas, Florida and Seoul, South Korea, to teach doctors how to use the new implant. He also devotes an entire page on his website to the Natrelle, which is nicknamed the “gummy bear implant” because of its glutinous consistency.

Dr. Bengtson said that any time he spends not treating patients represents lost revenue, “Although to many it looks like a lot of money, it actually is about one-tenth of the money that I’m not being compensated for being out of the office,” he said. Dr. Bengtson added that a significant portion of the money was actually for research and what he described as “pass-through” money that he gave to patients for participating in studies.

Like other physicians, Dr. Bengtson said he did the work mainly to help educate other doctors. “When I present, I present very transparently,” he said in an interview.

But Dr. Kesselheim, of Harvard, questioned the value of company-sponsored presentations. “It provides a very narrow educational experience,” he said.

It has also sometimes led to ethical lapses, where doctors with financial interests in companies do not fully disclose them.

One high-earning doctor, Dr. Barry Weinstock of Leesburg, Fla., did not disclose a payout of more than $100,000 in a recent journal article. He received the money in August 2013 after a company that he had invested in, Idev Technologies, was acquired by the device company Abbott.

In September of last year, Dr. Weinstock, a cardiologist, submitted an article to a medical journal in which he briefly mentioned an Idev product, the Supera stent, in a favorable light.

Dr. Weinstock did disclose his ties to two other products that were more prominently mentioned in the article, in Vascular Disease. But he said that he did not believe he needed to mention the payout from Idev because he mentioned its product only in passing. “I was not advocating the use of the Supera stent,” he said in an interview, referring to the Idev product. “It was merely mentioned in the background of the article, and I wasn’t actually suggesting that anybody use it.”

Some medical ethicists said that although Dr. Weinstock’s failure to disclose his tie was a minor one, he most likely should have mentioned it.

Bill Norton, the president of HMP Communications, which publishes the journal, said Dr. Weinstock did not disclose the connection. After he was contacted by a reporter, he said that he had investigated the issue and was correcting the disclosure.

Dr. Weinstock also speaks and consults for a range of companies, including the device companies W. L. Gore, Boston Scientific and the drug maker Eli Lilly. Like Dr. Bengtson, he said he lost money when he gave speeches, but he acknowledged that it carried other benefits. “For your own personal career and your own practice, there’s a benefit to being viewed as someone who is an expert and leader in the field,” he said.

Another doctor, Michael B. Wood, the former chief executive of the Mayo Clinic Foundation, earned more than $237,000 last year from serving on the boards of two separate medical companies.

Dr. Wood, who helped draft some of Mayo’s conflict of interest policies when he was chief executive, retired about a decade ago and still works occasionally in Mayo’s Jacksonville, Fla., clinic.

“Anytime I was asked to be on a public board, I turned it down until I was retired,” he said in an interview. Dr. Wood also said that the payment data in the federal database sounded “a little high.”

Mayo has tightened its rules in recent years about how much employees can earn from outside board positions after hearing reports of potential conflicts at other health care institutions, according to Dr. Richard L. Ehman, a professor of radiology who helps oversee Mayo’s conflict of interest policies. “We’re constantly revisiting our policies in light of what we’re seeing,” he said."

Having a medical condition, or having been a victim of a crime, is simply not relevant to most employment or credit decisions.

Third, people aren’t told they are on these lists, so they have no opportunity to correct bad information. The Arkansas woman found out about the inaccurate report only when she was denied a job. She was one of the rare ones.

“Data-driven” hiring practices are under increasing scrutiny, because the data may be a proxy for race, class or disability. For example, in 2011, CVS settled a charge of disability discrimination after a job applicant challenged a personality test that probed mental health issues. But if an employer were to secretly use lists based on inferences about mental health, it would be nearly impossible for an affected applicant to find out what was going on. Secrecy is discrimination’s best friend: Unknown unfairness can never be detected, let alone corrected.

These problems can’t be solved with existing law. The Federal Trade Commission has strained to understand personal data markets — a $156-billion-a-year industry — and it can’t find out where the data brokers get their information, and whom they sell it to. Hiding behind a veil of trade secrecy, most refuse to divulge this vital information.

The market in personal information offers little incentive for accuracy; it matters little to list-buyers whether every entry is accurate — they need only a certain threshold percentage of “hits” to improve their targeting. But to individuals wrongly included on derogatory lists, the harm to their reputation is great.

The World Privacy Forum, a research and advocacy organization, estimates that there are about 4,000 data brokers. They range from giants like Acxiom, a publicly traded company that helps marketers target consumer segments, to boutiques like Paramount Lists, which has compiled lists of addicts and debtors. Companies like these vacuum up data from just about any source imaginable: consumer health websites, payday lenders, online surveys, warranty registrations, Internet sweepstakes, loyalty-card data from retailers, charities’ donor lists, magazine subscription lists, and information from public records.

It’s unrealistic to expect individuals to inquire, broker by broker, about their files. Instead, we need to require brokers to make targeted disclosures to consumers. Uncovering problems in Big Data (or decision models based on that data) should not be a burden we expect individuals to solve on their own.

Privacy protections in other areas of the law can and should be extended to cover consumer data. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, obliges doctors and hospitals to give patients access to their records. The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives loan and job applicants, among others, a right to access, correct and annotate files maintained by credit reporting agencies.

It is time to modernize these laws by applying them to all companies that peddle sensitive personal information. If the laws cover only a narrow range of entities, they may as well be dead letters. For example, protections in Hipaa don’t govern the “health profiles” that are compiled and traded by data brokers, which can learn a great deal about our health even without access to medical records.

Congress should require data brokers to register with the Federal Trade Commission, and allow individuals to request immediate notification once they have been placed on lists that contain sensitive data. Reputable data brokers will want to respond to good-faith complaints, to make their lists more accurate. Plaintiffs’ lawyers could use defamation law to hold recalcitrant firms accountable.

We need regulation to help consumers recognize the perils of the new information landscape without being overwhelmed with data. The right to be notified about the use of one’s data and the right to challenge and correct errors is fundamental. Without these protections, we’ll continue to be judged by a big-data Star Chamber of unaccountable decision makers using questionable sources."

TO THE EDITOR:

Re “Repeating the Mistakes of History” (Hard Cases, Oct. 20): Dr. Abigail Zuger is dead on. Electronic medical records do a great job of creating a billable document. But all too often the big picture is buried in the scattered profusion of data and identical cut-and-paste notes. And during the appointment the computer competes for the attention of the physician. I also have to refer to the screen at times, but as a psychiatrist I have clung to 1) jotting things down with an actual pen while people tell me their stories face–to-face, and then 2) dictating my notes, which is fast and individualized, and allows me to review the visit in my mind one more time as I speak.

How refreshing to read that the old-fashioned virtue of detailed medical history taking, pen in hand, still has its champions.

Mental Health: Ways to Ease a Burden

TO THE EDITOR:

“Compulsions That Cannot Be Ignored” (Personal Health, Oct. 14) highlights the fact that too few patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder receive appropriate therapy. We wish to add that patients who have difficulty complying with rigorous cognitive behavioral therapy schedules may achieve major benefit from pharmacotherapy. Also, missing from the description of therapies is neuromodulation for those with the most severe and intractable forms of O.C.D. Deep brain stimulation is a neurosurgical treatment that can provide dramatic improvement when medications and cognitive behavioral therapy are ineffective. While appropriate for only a few, deep brain stimulation is an important part of the therapeutic landscape.

SAN FRANCISCO — The constant drumbeat of data breaches won’t cease anytime soon, according to a new report from California’s attorney general, Kamala D. Harris.

There were 167 data breaches reported in California last year, an increase of 28 percent from the 131 data breaches reported the previous year. The information of more than 18.5 million California residents was compromised in 2013, a significant jump from the 2.5 million compromised records in 2012.

Those numbers were skewed by two widespread breaches last year. At Target, personal records for 41 million people were compromised, and at LivingSocial, hackers gained access to 50 million records. According to the attorney general, each of these two breaches put 7.5 million California residents’ information at risk.

In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Harris said that for the first ten months of 2014, breaches are up 30 percent from 2013.

“We are increasingly adopting technology that is putting our data in systems that are ripe for penetration,” Ms. Harris said. “We have not sufficiently inoculated ourselves. The bad guys have figured out where the vulnerabilities are and learned there is much to be profited and gained from exploiting them.”

The majority of breaches last year — 53 percent — were intentional, and involved malware and hacking, while a smaller number, 26 percent, was attributed to the physical loss of a computer or device. The report reiterates what many already knew: There is much more information to be stolen through hacking than physical loss. The vast majority of the 17 million records compromised in California last year — 93 percent — were attributable to malware or hacking, whereas only 1.15 million records were compromised by the physical loss of an electronic device.

The retail industry was the biggest target for hackers. Retail breaches affected 15.4 million records belonging to California residents — 84 percent of total records compromised. Companies in the financial services sector were the second most popular target, comprising 20 percent of all breaches, while health care companies comprised 15 percent of all reported victims.

Social Security numbers were the most frequently compromised records in 2013, not surprising given that Social Security numbers fetch top dollar on the black market, selling for more than even debit card information. Security experts say this is because the amount of fraud resulting from a Social Security number is much greater than the amount of fraud that results from stolen payment information. According to the California attorney general’s report, the average amount of fraud caused by a single Social Security number is $2,330 compared with $2,026 for a debit card and $1,251 for a stolen credit card.

While most companies that have lost Social Security information often offer free credit monitoring, the report found that some 29 percent of companies who could have offered free credit monitoring or identity protection services after a data breach last year chose not to.

Payment card data accounted for 38 percent of data breaches in California in 2013, followed by stolen medical information, which accounted for 19 percent of stolen data.

In its report, the attorney general’s office urged retailers and companies that handle personal or payment card information to move quickly to encrypt customers’ personal, medical and payment card data.

The report says retailers, in particular, should devalue stolen payment card information by migrating to payment systems that use surrogate tokens, instead of the actual payment card data. By using such tokens, the attorney general’s office said, payment data stolen from one institution cannot be used to make a future payment or counterfeit a stolen credit card.

The payment industry is already pushing merchants to adopt such systems and has set a soft deadline of October 2015, when new rules about fraud liability go into effect. Under the new rules, companies that have had a data breach could be held accountable for any fraudulent charges if they have not upgraded to the new system.

“I think we are at an inflection point,” Ms. Harris said. “We’re starting to see that this technology that allows us to collect and keep information can be helpful, but it’s also very valuable to predators. Now, we have to protect it.”"

Even when real names and other personal information are stripped from big data sets, it is often possible to use just a few pieces of the information to identify a specific person, according to a study to be published Friday in the journal Science.

In the study, titled “Unique in the Shopping Mall: On the Reidentifiability of Credit Card Metadata,” a group of data scientists analyzed credit card transactions made by 1.1 million people in 10,000 stores over a three-month period. The data set contained details including the date of each transaction, amount charged and name of the store.

Although the information had been “anonymized” by removing personal details like names and account numbers, the uniqueness of people’s behavior made it easy to single them out.

In fact, knowing just four random pieces of information was enough to reidentify 90 percent of the shoppers as unique individuals and to uncover their records, researchers calculated. And that uniqueness of behavior — or “unicity,” as the researchers termed it — combined with publicly available information, like Instagram or Twitter posts, could make it possible to reidentify people’s records by name.

“The message is that we ought to rethink and reformulate the way we think about data protection,” said Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a graduate student in computational privacy at the M.I.T. Media Lab who was the lead author of the study. “The old model of anonymity doesn’t seem to be the right model when we are talking about large-scale metadata.”

The analysis of large data sets containing details on people’s behavior holds great potential to improve public health, city planning and education.

But the study calls into question the standard methods many companies, hospitals and government agencies currently use to anonymize their records. It may also give ammunition to some technologists and privacy advocates who have challenged the consumer-tracking processes used by advertising software and analytics companies to tailor ads to so-called anonymous users online.

This is hardly the first research effort to identify weaknesses in standard methods of de-identifying sensitive information about people.

In a study in 2008, two computer scientists, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, reported that they had been able to reidentify some Netflix users in a database of nameless customer records the company had made available for researchers competing to improve the company’s recommendation engine.

In a study in 2013, Latanya Sweeney, a computer scientist at Harvard, demonstrated that researchers were able to reidentify patients by name in a supposedly anonymized hospitalization data set made publicly available by Washington State.

And last fall, a reporter at Gawker was able to reidentify Kourtney Kardashian, Ashlee Simpson and other celebrities in an “anonymized” database of taxi ride records made public by New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission.

If companies or institutions are to continue to make these kinds of data sets widely available, they should quantitatively attest to the risks of reidentification, the researchers wrote in the study in Science.

“A data set’s lack of names, home addresses, phone numbers or other obvious identifiers,” they wrote, “does not make it anonymous nor safe to release to the public and to third parties.”"

“This is one of the worst breaches I have ever seen,” said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer education and advocacy group. “These people knew what they were doing and recognized there was a treasure trove here, and I think they are going to use it to engage in very sophisticated kinds of identity theft.”

Anthem officials became aware of the breach when one of their senior administrators noticed someone was using his identity to request information from the database. The request — or query — by the hackers appears so far to have been for financial information only. Anthem officials say that medical information in insurance claims shared with doctors and hospitals — like whether a customer was treated for substance abuse, for example — does not appear to have been taken in the attack.

“We’re positive that the rogue query did not have medical data in it,” said Thomas Miller, Anthem’s chief information officer. The people who gained access to the database “consciously selected what they selected.”

The insurer, along with federal investigators and security experts from FireEye’s Mandiant division, is now trying to determine whether there were other requests that it did not detect, a process that could take several more weeks.

Mr. Miller said Anthem and other health care companies had become increasingly aware of the criminal value of the information they have, in light of the large cyberattacks against financial service companies like JPMorgan Chase or retailers like Target.

“People have known for a long time financial information has its security needs,” he said. Anthem, he said, had doubled its investment in this area over the last four years and was actively considering encrypting its internal database as well as taking other steps to improve its security.

Anthem operates health plans under numerous brands, including Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield.

While experts like Mr. Stephens said the hackers might not have been particularly interested in the medical information available in Anthem’s database, the company’s decision to make the breach public quickly means that it is early in the investigation into exactly what happened and what information may have been compromised. “You can spend months doing the forensics,” said Fred Cate, a law professor and cybersecurity expert at Indiana University.

While he praised Anthem for taking the “unusual and quite laudable step in coming forward quite quickly,” he cautioned that company officials might not know the scope of the attack at this point.

Still, Mr. Cate said the medical information was not likely to result in the public unveiling of sensitive medical information, unlike smaller attacks aimed at finding something embarrassing or derogatory about an executive or celebrity. “As a general matter, huge breaches often result in less harm than targeted breaches,” he said. “The notion that someone’s poring over this data is highly unlikely.”

The decision by Anthem to bring in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and go public with the breach is the kind of move that law enforcement officials have been encouraging for the last several months. F.B.I. officials have appeared at a number of industry conferences urging corporate executives to promptly report breaches and, when possible, share information about the breach with competitors.

But experts say health organizations like Anthem are likely to be vulnerable targets because they have been slower to adopt measures like keeping personal information in separate databases that can be closed off in an attack. They “are generally less secure than financial service companies who have the same type of customer data,” said Avivah Litan, an analyst for Gartner who specializes in cybersecurity.

Last summer’s attack on JPMorgan Chase, for example, compromised the personal information of 83 million households and small businesses, but the breach was limited to nonfinancial information like addresses and phone numbers because the bank’s more sensitive information was walled off in a way the hackers could not penetrate.

Anthem’s fundamental mistake was to assume that information within its database was secure, said John Kindervag, an analyst with Forrester Research, and thus not apply the same protective standards the company uses when sending data to a doctor’s office. “All cybercrime is an inside job,” he said, because the criminals are able to penetrate a database from the outside and act as an insider in gaining access to data, which is what occurred in the Anthem breach.

Current federal privacy regulations, and the industry standard, call for encrypting information that is being sent from the database. Health insurance companies frequently share information with doctors, hospitals and others. In fact, the sharing of medical records is encouraged by the federal government.

While the health industry has not previously experienced the large-scale breaches that have plagued retailers like Target and Home Depot, there have been smaller attacks. Statistics maintained by the federal government’s Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Human Services say there have been 740 major health care breaches affecting 29 million people over the last five years.

Katherine Keefe, global focus group leader for breach response services at Beazley, which underwrites cyberliability policies, said health care companies were attractive targets to hackers because of the wealth of sensitive personal information they maintained in their networks. She said the information that health providers maintain about consumers tended to be more valuable on the black market than the credit card information that is often stolen from on a retailer.

She said the combination of Social Security information and medical histories was a valuable commodity to criminals. The combination is enough for some of Anthem’s customers to become victims of identity theft or email phishing schemes in which criminals try to trick unsuspecting people into providing their credit card information.

Stolen medical information could also be used to make false insurance claims.

“The value to a criminal of having a full set of medical information on a person can go for $40 to $50 on the street. By contrast, a credit card number is often worth $4 or $5,” Ms. Keefe said."

On Friday, Anthem sent out an alert to its customers warning them of the scam, which the company described as an “opportunistic” attempt to take advantage of news of the breach, but the company emphasized it had no evidence that the scam artists were the hackers.

The company, which operates under a series of Blue Cross plans in states like California, Connecticut and New York, is working with federal investigators to determine the source of the attack. Some signs continued to point to China, which has previously been thought to target health care companies, although the investigation is still in its early stages.

If Chinese hackers are responsible, it raises an immediate and hard-to-answer question: Are they acting on behalf of the government? Or are they independent actors, seeking to sell the information they have obtained?

The difference is a big one. The United States has already indicted five members of a People’s Liberation Army unit that is thought to be responsible for stealing intellectual property, usually designs from American and European companies. But the group is not known for stealing large amounts of personal information.

The key is the hackers’ motive. While they could be preparing to sell the information on the black market, they may also be searching for intelligence on government officials or senior executives who mask their personal information, but tend to provide real names and real numbers when dealing with health-related matters.

“The question is whether this is about espionage or theft,” said one government official who was briefed on the investigation.

As a rich source of personal information, health care organizations — like hospitals, doctors’ offices and insurers — are increasingly going to be vulnerable to attacks, according to security experts. “Anthem is not the last of these organizations,” said Cameron Camp, a researcher for ESET, which specializes in data security. “We’re going to see that style of attack again.”

Medical identify theft is on the rise, experts say, because it pays. In black-market auctions, complete patient medical records tend to fetch higher prices than credit card numbers. One security expert said that at one auction a patient medical record sold for $251, while credit card records were selling for 33 cents.

After the large data breaches at major retailers like Target and Home Depot, the black market for credit cards has been flooded. And after the bank becomes aware of the theft, those cards are usually canceled quickly.

In contrast, patient medical records typically include information not easily destroyed, including date of birth, Social Security numbers and even physical characteristics that make them more useful for things like identity theft, creation of visas or insurance fraud by falsely billing for expensive medical or dental procedures that were either never done or performed on someone else. Some criminals have also tried a form of so-called ransom ware in which they threaten to reveal medical information unless they are paid.

“The whole thing is evolving,” said Barbara Filkins, an analyst with the SANS Institute, which has studied the risk to the health care sector.

Data Breaches at Health Care Organizations A survey of 91 health care organizations in 2013 shows that 90 percent of them experienced at least one data breach that year. The study was conducted by the Ponemon Institute, a research center that focuses on data security. PERCENT OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT: Experienced a data breach involving loss of patient data in 2013 NO YES 1 incident more than 5 incidents 10% 16% 36% 38% 2 to 5 incidents NUMBER OF RECORDS COMPROMISED PER BREACH 1,000 to 5,000 10,000 to 100,000 10 to 100 49% 25% 16% 8% 2% 100 to 1,000 5,000 to 10,000

Hospital systems, for example, are increasingly asking for photo IDs and driver’s licenses in an effort to block patients who have stolen someone else’s medical identity, said John Barlament, a lawyer at Quarles & Brady in Milwaukee. The use of medical identity fraud is growing, he said. “It’s a one-way trend here,” he said.

The push to digitize patient health records in hospitals and doctors’ offices has also made medical records increasingly vulnerable, according to security experts. Moving medical records from paper to electronic form allows both patients and providers better access, but it has also made patient records susceptible to breaches, whether unintentionally or through a criminal attack.

About 90 percent of health care organizations reported they have had at least one data breach over the last two years, according to a survey of health care providers published last year by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy and data protection research firm. The founder, Larry Ponemon, a security expert, says most were because of employee negligence or system flaws, but a growing number are malicious or criminal.

Last year, 18 health care providers reported data breaches because of some form of hacking. Information at Centura Health was compromised last year after a phishing scheme obtained access to employee email accounts. The data included, in some instances, Social Security numbers, Medicare beneficiary numbers and clinical information for 12,000 patients of the facility, based in Englewood, Colo. In another case, a keystroke logger virus that infected three computers for a few weeks early last year at the student health center at the University of California, Irvine, may have captured patient’s health and dental insurance numbers and diagnoses.

Health care providers have sharply increased their spending on data security in the last year, but they remain technologically far behind other industries, say experts.

“When we go to a health care show and you look at the screens of different systems, it’s like we’re looking at Windows XP,” said Bob Janacek, a co-founder and chief technology officer of DataMotion, an email encryption and health information service provider. “But you go to a banking show and they’re talking about how to slice a billionth of a second off a transaction to get a competitive edge, it’s just totally different.”

In the new electronic records world, security experts say the risks of a data breach are found on many fronts. For instance, there are systems and protocols that allow for patient medical records to be encrypted and emailed from one provider to another, but some doctors are sending clinical records through personal email accounts using their own smartphones or tablets.

The Anthem breach has become the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny. Several state attorneys general are also conducting their own investigations or considering doing so, including George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of state insurance regulators, said it planned a multistate examination of the insurer. “We are in agreement that an immediate and comprehensive review of the company’s security must be a priority to ensure protection of consumers who are covered by Anthem,” said Monica Lindeen, the association president and the Montana insurance regulator, in a statement."

But cyberthieves can do some serious damage with medical information as well.

Anthem Health said this week that hackers obtained names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdays, email and employment information on up to 80 million current and former customers and Anthem employees. Although Anthem says the attackers did not get any medical records, they did get access to medical identification numbers found on insurance cards. Anthem offers several Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance plans across the country.

“You don’t need a complete medical record to commit medical identity theft if you have the correct name and Social Security number,” said Pam Dixon, executive director of World Privacy Forum. “The chief harm for medical identity theft is that your medical record will change without your knowledge.”

And in this case, the hackers have enough information to do exactly that. Here’s what you need to know:

THEFT TYPES In large-scale breaches like the one at Anthem, experts said the criminals could pose as medical billers and fraudulently charge consumers’ insurance companies for medical services and drugs. Not only is your insurer paying for something that you didn’t ask for, but the fraudsters can also alter your medical record, Ms. Dixon said.

With an insurance ID number in hand, it can be easier for criminals to attempt to acquire medical records or insurance codes to help guide them on what to bill for, she explained. “Searches through the data for cancer survivors or even those in current cancer treatment would allow for fake billing to be piggybacked onto the real billing. This makes it extremely difficult for the health plan to detect the fake billing, and the thieves then will get a stream of payouts over time. It adds up to a lot of money quickly.”"

The administration’s proposal, considered a discussion draft, would need a congressional sponsor before it could be officially introduced. Already, though, industry analysts said that the proposal, along with several other legislative efforts on commercial privacy, was unlikely to be enacted in a Republican Congress.

The White House effort comes during heightened public awareness about both government and commercial data-mining. And the proposal drew sharp reactions.

Some prominent legislators and privacy law scholars said the administration’s effort failed to endow citizens with direct and clear legal rights to control who collects their information and how they use it. And the bill, they say, largely puts companies in charge of defining their own criteria for fair and unfair use of consumers’ personal details.

“Instead of codes of conduct developed by industries that have historically been opposed to strong privacy measures, we need uniform and legally enforceable rules that companies must abide by and consumers can rely upon,” Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been investigating consumer-profiling companies called data brokers, said in a statement on Friday.

Companies like Acxiom, a database marketer in Little Rock, Ark., for instance, help marketers target individual consumers by estimated household income, ZIP code, race, ethnicity, social network or interests like “smoking/tobacco” or “gaming-casino.”

Experian Marketing Services, another marketing company, uses data-mining to stratify consumers into socio-economic clusters with names like “small town, shallow pockets” and “diapers and debit cards.”

Armed with that kind of information, advertisers might, say, send smokers ads for the latest air filters. But in a report last year on data brokers, the Federal Trade Commission warned that such profiling could be also used in ways that could “adversely impact consumers.” Third parties, regulators wrote, could potentially use brokers’ information on smokers to decide whether someone was “a poor credit or insurance risk, or an unsuitable candidate for employment or admission to a university.”

The report called on Congress to enact legislation to protect this kind of volatile information by, among other things, requiring companies that serve consumers to obtain consent from individuals before collecting such sensitive details about them.

While the White House’s proposal does not explicitly require companies to obtain affirmative consent to collect health information, it does call on companies to give individuals reasonable means to control the use of their personal data, depending on the context and “in proportion to the privacy risk.”

Microsoft heralded the draft bill as a welcome first step in improving consumer trust in how companies handled their information.

“The White House framework tackles issues that are crucial to build trust and foster innovation,” Brendon Lynch, chief privacy officer of Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Friday. “Not all will agree with every aspect of the proposal — some will say it goes too far, while others will say it doesn’t go far enough — but it’s a good place to start the conversation.”

But some privacy advocates warned against the bill’s reliance on industry-developed codes of conduct. The process, they contended, would allow companies to define for themselves whether their data-use policies constituted privacy risks to consumers. They also said the bill offered companies loopholes that would help them avoid giving consumers meaningful control over their records and make it difficult for federal regulators to enforce the legislation.

“While it claims to provide rights to consumers, behind its flimsy policy curtain is a system that gives real control to the companies that now gather our information,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.

A few privacy law scholars said that the draft bill could undermine protections consumers already had. If enacted as currently written, for instance, it could pre-empt stronger laws in a few states that require companies to obtain consumers’ explicit consent before collecting unique biometric information like fingerprints or facial scans.

“It would override state statutes that give people more protection,” said Alvaro M. Bedoya, executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center. “It would be a significant setback for privacy.”"

“No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,” Mrs. Clinton told reporters.

That may be. But historians, of course, perhaps after a grace period of some years, very much want to use personal emails and other private records to shed light on a public life.

“If she becomes president, we would eventually want to have all the intimate details of her life before the presidency,” said Robert Dallek, a prominent presidential historian. “It’s all part of the historical record.”

Mr. Dallek noted that many personal archives of public figures have been withheld from the public for many years after their deaths. But as long as the records are preserved, there is the possibility they will someday add to the understanding of history.

For example, in the late 1990s, Mr. Dallek became the first scholar to be given access to President John F. Kennedy’s medical records, which were controlled by a panel of three Kennedy associates who had rebuffed researchers for decades after his assassination. The historian’s discovery that Kennedy had more serious health problems than previously known, and had been treated with an extensive arsenal of drugs, made news around the world.

“It provided a new perspective on his life and his presidency,” said Mr. Dallek, who wrote about the records in his 2003 Kennedy biography.

While most government email is now subject to preservation rules, personal email can be deleted with a couple of clicks. While letters may have ended up in a shoe box in the attic, email accounts can be lost when users switch Internet providers. But for Ms. Goodwin, the problem goes deeper than the loss of such records. It is the nature of the technology, which she says rarely provides the visceral intimacy of earlier records.

“What will be missing in the future is the best of the material we have today, which is handwritten letters and diaries,” she said.

Several of Lincoln’s associates kept meticulous diaries that were crucial in writing her 2005 book on Lincoln, Ms. Goodwin said. For “The Bully Pulpit,” her 2013 study of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, their thousands of preserved letters, mixing family gossip and government business, gave an intimate account of what they did and how they felt about it, she said.

“You feel like you’re looking over their shoulder as they write,” Ms. Goodwin said. By comparison, she said, emails offer less depth and intimacy. “I would never write about a modern president,” she said.

But for some historians, such complaints overlook the fact that technology gives as well as takes. There are hundreds of hours of video and audio recordings of a public figure like Mrs. Clinton. She also joined Twitter in 2013 to great fanfare.

Some archivists, in fact, bemoan the overwhelming volume of material this era will bequeath. Larry Cebula, a digital archivist for the State of Washington who teaches history at Eastern Washington University, apologized in a semiserious blog post to historians of the next century for “all the stuff.” If Thomas Jefferson were alive, he wrote, he might be commenting on his friends’ Facebook pages and posting photographs to Instagram.

“I think historians a century from now will view this period as a time of an explosion of records,” Mr. Cebula said. “Even if Facebook is out of business, someone will have bought the archive.”

Of course, politicians are wary of some record-keeping. Mrs. Clinton may have deleted half of her emails, but her predecessor at the State Department, Condoleezza Rice, chose not to use email for work at all, partly out of concern that email mix-ups could lead to diplomatic misunderstandings, her aides say.

A revealing precedent is the tape recorder. Kennedy’s selective taping left an invaluable record of White House discussions during the Cuban missile crisis, and Lyndon B. Johnson recorded fascinating calls with many contemporaries, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the time of the civil rights marches in Selma, Ala.

But Richard M. Nixon’s tangle with taping, in which incriminating recordings during the Watergate scandal helped end his presidency, has left his successors disinclined to record. “I doubt that we’ll find recordings from the recent presidents,” Mr. Dallek said. “That’s a shame.”"

It said the attackers may have gained access to claims data, including clinical information, along with banking account numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data in an attack that began in May 2014.

It is the largest breach reported to date involving patient medical information, according to Dave Kennedy, an expert in health care security who is chief executive of TrustedSEC.

About six million of the people whose accounts were affected are residents of Washington state, where customers include employees of Amazon.com, Microsoft and Starbucks, according to Premera. The rest are scattered across the United States.

But the bill is likely to be opposed by education privacy advocates who seek stronger consent mechanisms for students and parents — as well as by industry groups that favor self-regulation.

“All this bill does is add additional legal hurdles for innovating educational services,” an executive at a technology trade group wrote to associates on Friday in a private email that was forwarded to a reporter with the stipulation that the writer of the email not be named.

As school districts across the country turn to powerful new digital education tools, efforts to increase teacher and parent buy-in have been multiplying. Industry executives say that so-called adaptive learning products seem particularly promising. These are apps and sites that can collect and analyze a wealth of student information with the idea of tailoring lessons on the spot to the abilities of each child.

“The world of big data has hit the classroom,” Mr. Messer said. “We want to preserve the positive benefits the technology can bring to student outcomes.”

Some parents have started warning, however, that school districts lack the resources to monitor how technology vendors use and secure their children’s records. These parents say they’re troubled by the risk of everything from data breaches and identity theft to the possibility of companies sharing sensitive details like students’ grades, disciplinary actions or health data with college or job recruiters.

Although there is a federal education privacy law that requires schools to maintain control over students’ educational records, critics say it has not kept pace with the practices of educational technology companies.

“As a parent, I’m concerned that there are vast amounts of academic, physical and behavioral information being acquired on children that could have negative implications for our children’s future,” said Anna Shah-Bomba, a mother of an elementary school student and a college student in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

Last year, for instance, ConnectEDU — a career planning site with listings on the academic, personal and career details of millions of students — sought to sell its databases as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.

After federal regulators intervened, the acquiring companies notified the site’s account holders that they could choose to have their information deleted.

Partly in response to such incidents, President Obama in January announced a proposal for a new student digital privacy law.

“We’re saying that data collected on students in the classroom should only be used for educational purposes,” Mr. Obama said in a speech at the time.

The Messer-Polis bill incorporates that principle. In addition to prohibiting school services from personalizing ads to students, the bill obliges vendors to delete students’ records should a school request it. It also requires vendors to allow schools or parents to see and correct student files.

But some privacy experts said the draft bill had major loopholes that would allow school services to use student information in ways students and parents might not expect or find acceptable.

For example, it allows school services to make unilateral changes to their contracts and privacy policies. It permits them to disclose student information for purposes like preparing for “employment opportunities.” And it would not prohibit sites like ConnectEDU from selling student records as part of a merger or acquisition.

The bill is also unlikely to prohibit companies like Pearson from monitoring the social media posts of students if those activities are performed on behalf of state educational agencies.

“Although this bill has some promising features,” said Khaliah Barnes, director of the student privacy project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research center in Washington, “it ultimately fails to uphold President Obama’s promise that the data collected in an educational context can be used only for educational purposes.”"
244,1303,2015-03-29T00:00:00Z,article,Company Thinks It Has Answer for Lower Health Costs: Customer Service,5515464938f0d82942dd6344,"organizations:Iora Health LLC, subject:Medicine and Health, subject:Health Insurance and Managed Care, glocations:Seattle (Wash), persons:Fernandopulle, Rushika (1967- )",SundayBusiness,3.03e-39,None,"An innovative practice hopes its patient-centered methods will work on a national scale, allowing it to expand without losing effectiveness.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/upshot/small-company-has-plan-to-provide-primary-care-for-the-masses.html,3160,"An innovative practice hopes its patient-centered methods will work on a national scale, allowing it to expand without losing effectiveness.","Iora thinks it may be able to solve both problems and make money doing so. Its business model is meant to keep patients like Ms. Schock out of the hospital by improving service while earning a dividend on the expensive care it was able to avoid.

The practice where Dr. Haymon works, in the Central District of Seattle, is one of five that Iora Health opened in just a few months last year. The company now has 140 employees in 11 practices, and it plans to open at least 10 more in 2015. It just raised $28 million in its third round of venture capital financing to help it expand. The ultimate goal is hundreds of practices across the country, a kind of Starbucks for health care. (The company recruited one executive whose last job was opening Au Bon Pain franchises.)

Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, who is one of the company’s founders and serves as its chief executive, said: “Building one good practice is mildly interesting, because a few people have done that. But how do you scale that across the country? That’s much harder.”

There is plenty of innovation in health care delivery, and Dr. Fernandopulle is far from the only physician who thinks he has a better idea about how to keep patients healthier for less money.

But his idea is intriguing because it offers the possibility of mass replication of quality care, which might affect the way medicine is practiced beyond his company. Few health care innovators now expand beyond their original location. A team of Stanford researchers recently looked around the country to find what they considered to be the very best primary care practices: All 11 had either one location or just a handful of sites.

“Most doctors have no business skills, and they don’t understand what venture investors and private investors do,” said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a professor of medicine and an author of the study, who directs the Stanford Clinical Excellence Research Center.

Dr. Fernandopulle’s goal is to “transform health care.” And his strategy is to take something small and effective and reproduce it in office after office. But as Professor Milstein points out, running one unconventional practice and keeping it great is very different from running 100.

Patients as Customers

The Iora practice where Dr. Haymon works is housed in an old beauty school east of downtown, in a commercial plaza shared by a Red Apple grocery store, a Walgreens pharmacy, a busy Starbucks and a Taco Del Mar. When the practice opened, in October, construction was finished on only half the space. Doctors saw patients on one side of a wall, while a construction crew finished work on the other.

One morning, the Iora team gathered in a back conference room for an 8 o’clock meeting called the huddle. The meeting is an essential piece of the Iora formula. The huddle leader rotates among the staff — a gesture to emphasize that the doctors don’t run the place. (This democratic impulse sometimes goes to extremes; there is no receptionist, and all the staff members, doctors included, trade off answering the phone.) This meeting was run by Michelle Howe, a registered nurse, and everyone had a silver Apple laptop for looking at patient data.

Iora practices do not accept any patients off the street. Instead, the company teams up with either an employer that pays for its workers’ health care or a private Medicare plan. Most of Iora’s early practices were with large companies looking to save on their health care bills. Others are partnerships with the health insurance company Humana. In most of the arrangements, the company receives a flat monthly payment for each patient and, if it saves the company money on overall health spending, it takes a percentage of what is saved.

The new Seattle practice has a Medicare plan as its partner. The huddle gives the team time to talk about the patients who will be visiting that day and ones who aren’t coming in but whom the clinicians are worried about. A patient like Ms. Schock is a good example of one who would have a high Iora “worry score,” a metric that is half clinical formula and half instinct. Patients with the highest scores are talked about the most in an attempt to think about their problems before their health deteriorates.

The huddle is also an old-fashioned staff meeting. There was a report, for instance, on the customer satisfaction surveys that the practice gives each patient after every visit. Patients are asked to rate their experience from one to 10 and to answer two other questions about their experiences. Iora’s management and its partners often point to this “net promoter score” questionnaire, which is intended to measure how likely patients are to endorse or promote the company, as evidence of the company’s success.

Similar surveys are conducted in other industries. Apple scores a 72. The health insurance company Kaiser has the highest score in its industry, a 35. An Iora practice, on average, scores above 90. Use of the questionnaires is one of the company’s basic principles. Staff members review the previous day’s answers at every huddle.In Seattle, Dr. Marty Levine questioned whether it made sense to ask the patients, most of them over 65, to answer three questions every time they visited. Geriatric medicine involves a lot of questionnaires, Dr. Levine said, and the patients might get fatigued. “Have we thought about just doing one question?” he asked.

There was discussion, and voting. In the end, the team voted 6 to 5 to keep the questionnaires the same as those in the other Iora practices.

The moment brought out a tension in Iora’s expansion plan: Its mission is at once to develop a standard formula and to allow its professionals to experiment and adapt to local conditions. Certain elements — the company’s proprietary electronic medical records, the design of the consultation rooms, the daily huddle itself — are nonnegotiable.

But other details are up to the individual practice staff. Group classes, for example, differ by site. The Medicare-only practices feature aerobics classes. The New Hampshire practice holds a popular mindfulness meditation session. The carpenters’ union practice in Dorchester, Mass., has a class called “Hammer Time,” essentially yoga with tools.

Focus on Venture Funding

Iora was founded three years ago, but Dr. Fernandopulle began developing his model for medical care years before. His basic insight is aligned with a big concern in health reform circles: The system is in many ways designed around providing hospital treatment, the most expensive form of health care.

There can be big savings from providing primary care services that keep patients in poor health out of the emergency room and the hospital by, say, making sure a diabetic’s foot wound is treated before expensive amputation is necessary. One of Dr. Fernandopulle’s early practices, which treated high-risk casino workers in Atlantic City, was described in The New Yorker in 2011. The practice was able to reduce hospitalizations for its patients 40 percent and save the casino workers’ union 12 percent in total health care spending. To work, it required persuading the union to pay much higher, per patient monthly fees for primary care medicine instead of the usual system, paying doctors by the visit.

This monthly fee is now the center of Iora’s business model, and Dr. Fernandopulle says it has been liberating. Because doctors don’t need to bill for every service they provided, Iora was able to switch to an electronic system that was better suited to managing patient health. And doctors don’t have to worry about documenting specialized codes for every visit to be paid. They can encourage patients to come in as often as they need. Iora makes staff members available around the clock through email and phone, services few practices provide because such visits can’t be billed.

The model also emphasizes the health coaches. Ms. Barrow, the health coach in Seattle, was trained overseas as a nurse, but a typical Iora coach has no health care training at all. Many come from customer service backgrounds. Their job is to help patients with health needs that are not medical — diet changes, tracking down the right supportive socks, finding free senior transportation vans that can transport them to office visits or exercise classes.

Most primary care doctors in the United States take care of more than 2,000 patients. A typical Iora doctor cares for about 1,000. Health coaches manage only a few hundred, giving them much more time for each one.

At an Iora practice in Hanover, N.H., for Dartmouth College employees, Patricia Fisken, a 63-year-old patient, and Tyler Hanna, a health coach, joked like old friends. In a sense, they are: Ms. Fisken, a music librarian at the college, comes in every few weeks to see Mr. Hanna, and she comes to the office every week for a mindfulness class. Ms. Fisken is basically healthy, but she is trying to lose weight and finds their regular sessions encouraging.

Dartmouth, one of the company’s first partners, says patient satisfaction is high and the school, a leader in health system research, is interested in whether this new model can work better than the usual way of doing things. But Richard G. Mills, the university’s executive vice president, said it was still unclear, three years in, whether the practice was saving the university money. The university would probably pay less to a conventional medical practice for patients like Ms. Fisken, without any serious health problems.

Iora has little published research on the cost savings it has achieved for its partners. The company’s small size makes it hard to produce data with statistical significance. Asked about current evidence of the model’s success, the company provided numbers about one of its sites, where researchers have compared Iora patients with similar patients elsewhere: Total spending was down 12 percent, with hospitalizations down 37 percent, compared with the control group. That may have been a practice with healthy patients, like Dartmouth, or one of the higher-risk patient groups; an Iora spokeswoman said she could not say which practice it was because of a confidentiality agreement with the sponsor.

Many of the basic elements of the Iora primary care approach — longer hours, more support staff and additional per patient funding — have been tried in other settings, especially in so-called patient-centered medical homes. So far, the results for those types of practices have not been promising. Few have shown real reductions in spending or in the frequency of patients entering hospitals.

Nonetheless, the company’s partners seem willing to give Iora the benefit of the doubt. Humana, which is working with Iora in the Seattle practices and two in Phoenix, wants to expand the contract to new sites, said Rich Powers, Humana’s vice president for provider management.

The company’s model has interested venture capital investors as well. The health care industry is in a period of rapid change, and many investors are looking for opportunities. Iora’s executives say all the waste in the health care system means there is plenty of money to be made with a more rational approach. And Iora’s investors — who have so far put in $42.25 million — think it can capture enough of those savings to be a strong investment.

“At hundreds of practices, on a consolidated basis it becomes very profitable,” said Michael Greeley, a general partner at the health care venture capital firm Foundation Medical Partners, the lead investor in the most recent funding round.

That ability to raise venture capital helped persuade the company’s executives that a profit-making model made sense. Most of the big hospital systems that are experimenting with new models of care are nonprofit. But Iora struggled to attract financing from the big health care foundations and the federal government. There is $10 billion in the federal budget to support health care innovation, including a special program just for primary care. But an Iora application was rejected because its model did not include co-payments, a typical requirement for Medicare.

“We found it was easier to convince V.C.s to invest in this,” Dr. Fernandopulle said. “The government has become so risk-averse because of the political climate.”

Expanding the Nest

An Iora is a type of bird native to Sri Lanka, where Dr. Fernandopulle was born, and the company’s Cambridge, Mass., headquarters is called “the nest.” The office feels like a tech start-up, with (mostly healthy) snacks in the kitchen and workstations set up on rows of long, shared tables. Many of its occupants are tech workers. Nearly 20 nest employees are developing the company’s electronic health record system. They built the first version in six months from scratch, and they are constantly refining it to run more smoothly and address requests from doctors.

A custom-built electronic health record system is the sort of investment that would never make sense if Iora were staying small. When the first practice opened, Steve Schrodel, the operations manager, spent hours logging every tongue depressor and latex glove he ordered into a database. For one practice, that would be a waste of time. But now, when Iora opens a new site, ordering supplies takes minutes.

Mr. Schrodel has the sort of unconventional background that the company seeks. He came to Iora after working for five years as a vice president for development at the restaurant chain Au Bon Pain. He was responsible for opening new stores in hospitals and airports.

Mr. Schrodel said the economics of a new Iora practice were surprisingly similar. “You need a certain amount of scale to make the model profitable,” he said. Dr. Fernandopulle estimates that achieving that size will take two more years.

But the mechanics of running a medical practice are different from those of a chain restaurant.

“This is, unfortunately, not like building Starbucks,” Dr. Fernandopulle said.

Most health care workers, of course, enter the field because they want to help people. But several Iora doctors and nurses told me Iora’s current customer-is-always-right approach is unusual compared with the places they worked before. At the Dartmouth practice, workers fretted over a single patient questionnaire that noted there was no milk in the lobby’s tea station.

As the company rapidly expands, replicating that customer-focused culture is difficult. Physicians need to be great doctors, of course, but they also need to be the sort of people who are comfortable when an intern leads the practice meeting or when they are asked to answer the phones.

Jill Exner, a nurse in Seattle, said she had struggled to think of former colleagues who would be good fits at Iora. Years working in hospitals had left many of them jaded, she said. “My nurse friends are really caring people, but there’s another piece of it.”

Dr. Fernandopulle and Alexander Packard, the company’s chief operating officer, have interviewed nearly all of the company’s current employees, and they have visited each of the sites many times. Both are charismatic leaders who leave strong impressions on the people they meet. (Nearly all the employees I interviewed quoted back things one or the other had told them.) But as the company grows, they will necessarily be less available.

The company’s answer to that problem is a human resources operation that tries to systematically identify people with the right qualities to join the practice.

Instead of inviting résumé drops, the company holds big open-house events where candidates go through a series of short interviews with Iora employees — a process they compare to speed-dating. Potential employees have interviews with six staff members in different roles, and any of them can veto a candidate. That has happened, for example, when a doctor was rude to a waiter at lunch. “We’re looking for things that don’t necessarily appear in the résumé,” said Jennifer Natenshon, a senior manager for talent and culture.

Frances Frei, a professor at Harvard Business School, studies businesses that specialize in customer service, and finds the Iora model intriguing.

“These guys have designed their model as if physics apply,” she said. A mistake many businesses make when they become bigger is that they become more complex. Iora seems focused on primary care, she said, with a particular reliance on health coaches, who are high in service but low in expertise and thus inexpensive to hire.

If scale in customer service businesses is difficult, then national scale in primary care medicine is unprecedented in the United States. Dr. Fernandopulle is confident, but he also knows the next few years will be telling.

“You don’t learn about this reading about it or talking about it in conferences,” he said. “You learn this by doing it.”"

Brigham and Women’s, where Mr. Keating had his surgery, is part of the Partners HealthCare Group, which now has 500,000 patients with web access to some of the information in their health records including conditions, medications and test results.

Other medical groups are beginning to allow patients online access to the notes taken by physicians about them, in an initiative called OpenNotes. In a yearlong evaluation project at medical groups in three states, more than two-thirds of the patients reported having a better understanding of their health and medical conditions, adopting healthier habits and taking their medications as prescribed more regularly.

The medical groups with OpenNotes programs include Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and the Veterans Affairs department. By now, nearly five million patients in America have been given online access to their notes.

As an articulate young scientist who had studied his condition, Mr. Keating had a big advantage over most patients in obtaining his data. He knew what information to request, spoke the language of medicine and did not need help. The information he collected includes the video of his 10-hour surgery, dozens of medical images, genetic sequencing data and 300 pages of clinical documents. Much of it is on his website, and he has made his medical data available for research.

Still, he said he encountered a medical culture resistant to sharing data, owing to tradition, business practices and legal concerns.

“The person with the least access to data in the system is the patient,” he said. “You can get it, but the burden is always on the patient. And it is scattered across many different silos of patient data.”

Since his diagnosis last summer, Mr. Keating has become a passionate advocate for giving patients all the medical data they ask for. He has given talks at M.I.T., where he studies mechanical engineering, he has met with doctors, hospital administrators and researchers, and he has been invited to the White House.

He knows that what he is pushing goes against convention.

To a hospital, a patient is a revenue-generating asset, said Ben Shneiderman, a professor at the University of Maryland who is a health technology expert. Hold onto the patient’s information, and you are more likely to keep the patient. Health software suppliers have traditionally sold closed, proprietary systems, which tend to lock in customers.

“The problem is that you have institutions whose business models do not favor sharing information, either with other hospitals or patients,” said Mr. Shneiderman.

Yet the economic incentives for data-sharing, some medical experts say, are beginning to fall into place. Increasingly, providers will be paid a set amount of money for a population of patients, an approach called accountable care, and a departure from fee-for-service reimbursement in which doctors and hospitals are paid for each test and treatment.

Accountable care reimbursement is a critical ingredient in the Obama administration’s health care overhaul.

“The accountable care world is based on wellness rather than episodic illness,” said Dr. John Halamka, chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess. “In the fee-for-service world, the incentives for data-sharing were not there. But with accountable care, providers cannot survive unless they share data,” to help improve care and eliminate unnecessary tests.

The medical groups, Dr. Halamka said, will insist that their technology suppliers open up their software for automated data handoffs, which are a fixture of Internet technology but not health care technology.

Dr. Halamka is part of an effort to accelerate the adoption of open technology standards in health care, the Argonaut Project, which began in December. It has representatives from a few large medical groups, but also from leading suppliers of electronic health records, including Epic, Cerner and McKesson.

The Argonaut project, said Claudia Williams, a senior adviser for health innovation and technology policy in the White House, is a “very hopeful sign” that “incentives are beginning to line up in a powerful way” to encourage more openness and sharing of data among providers and with patients.

Opening data to patients raises questions. Will worried patients inundate physicians with time-consuming questions? Will sharing patient data add to legal risks? One detail in the yearlong study of OpenNotes underlines doctors’ concerns; 105 primary physicians completed the study, but 143 declined to participate.

Still, the experience of the doctors in the evaluation seemed reassuring. Only 3 percent said they spent more time answering patient questions outside of visits. Yet knowing that patients could read the notes, one-fifth of the physicians said they changed the way they wrote about certain conditions, like substance abuse and obesity.

Evidence of the benefit to individuals from sharing information rests mainly on a few studies so far. For example, 55 percent of the members of the epilepsy community on PatientsLikeMe, a patient network, reported that sharing information and experiences with others helped them learn about seizures, and 27 percent said it helped them be more adherent to their medications.

Mr. Keating has no doubts. “Data can heal,” he said. “There is a huge healing power to patients understanding and seeing the effects of treatments and medications.”

Health information, by its very nature, is personal. So even when names and other identifiers are stripped off, sharing personal health data more freely with patients, health care providers and researchers raises thorny privacy issues.

Mr. Keating says he is a strong believer in privacy, but he personally believes that the benefits outweigh the risks — and whether to share data or not should be an individual’s choice and an individual responsibility.

Not everyone, surely, would be as comfortable as Mr. Keating is sharing all his medical information. But he says he believes that people will increasingly want access to their medical data and will share it, especially younger people reared on social networks and smartphones.

“This is what the next generation, which lives on data, is going to want,” Mr. Keating said."

Steven Keating, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab and a brain cancer survivor, was the subject of an article this week, presented as a super data cruncher of his own patient information.

The young scientist’s collection and analysis of his own data makes him an extraordinary exception today, but physicians and health care experts say he is a sprinter along a path others are walking — toward consumers taking a more active interest in gathering, studying and sharing their medical data. Better-informed patients, they say, are more likely to take better care of themselves, comply with prescription drug regimens and even detect early-warning signals of illness, as Mr. Keating did.

But there is another big potential benefit of the wider use and sharing of patient information — medical research. Mr. Keating himself calls it a “huge crowdsourcing opportunity for research.” Not surprisingly, he has offered up his own data for several research projects.

Research organizations are beginning to look at the opportunity in new ways as well. Traditionally, patient information has been tapped for research in large pooled databases. Individual contributions only made it in as part of these centralized efforts. That is still the norm, but change is coming. Institutional practice, individual attitudes and new technology are the reasons.

One technical tool that could push things along is Apple’s ResearchKit, which was introduced last month. The open-source software in ResearchKit would let medical researchers write applications to recruit subjects and collect their data from their iPhones or iPhone-linked fitness monitors, like the FitBit or Apple Watch.

New technology and the rise of the Facebook information-sharing culture have prompted researchers to rethink the patient asset in science. Dr. Stephen Friend is president of Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit organization that advocates open-data policies. Until a few years ago, he said, he saw efforts to share patient data as mainly a step to get people more engaged in their own health, but not something that could improve medical research.

Today, Dr. Friend said, his perspective is very different. “The patient, doctor and researcher – each is a different kind of expert,” he said. The promise, Dr. Friend said, is to “democratize medical discovery.”

The patient information can be medical documents, lab results, and biometric or activity data from smartphones or wearable devices. But Dr. Friend said it could also be more subjective information, like health apps in which people report how they feel or social network conversations about health.

Then, by mining the reports with analysis software, Dr. Friend said, “You can turn anecdotes into signals, unpacking the dimensions of disease and what makes people feel better. That’s what big data analysis is seeking to do.”

The journey from health to disease, Dr. Friend explained, is not a single step but a progression. Aggregated patient data, he said, could well provide insights on how to stave off chronic ailments like diabetes and heart disease. “That’s potentially what this kind of citizen science can uncover — how to be resilient to disease,” he said.

Reluctance to share personal health information is declining, and not only for cultural reasons. A prevalent fear, said Ben Heywood, co-founder and president of PatientsLikeMe, an online discussion and research forum, has been that if a person disclosed an illness, it might be more difficult to obtain health insurance. But the Affordable Care Act bans discrimination by insurers based on so-called pre-existing conditions. “The biggest deterrent has been removed by law,” Mr. Heywood said.

But concerns remain, especially about privacy, given the sensitive nature of medical information. One of the research projects Mr. Keating plans to share his data with is the Personal Genome Project at Harvard. The file of a person’s DNA fingerprint need not bear a name to identify its owner.

In its risks and benefits page, the project lists the benefits as contributing to a cause that advances science and satisfying personal curiosity. On the risk side, it states that in principle someone with scientific skills could use a person’s genome to infer paternity, generate statistical evidence that might hurt a person’s chances of getting a job, insurance or loans, and make synthetic DNA to plant at a crime scene.

In agreeing to the terms of the Human Genome Project, “you do sign off a lot,” said Mr. Keating, who is doing so without hesitation.

DALYs then incorporate the total years lived with disability — a measure based on international estimates of how much each nonfatal condition detracts from perfect health. Being paralyzed, for example, is considered close to half as healthy as perfect health, so every year you live with paralysis, you have lost the equivalent of half a year of healthy life.

Focusing on disability-adjusted life years may sound convoluted compared with simple lives lost. But it more closely aligns with most people’s intuitive sense of how health really works. Say, for example, that I’m in a paralyzing car crash at age 35, but survive until age 65, when I die (alas) from a heart attack. Then, assuming an ideal life span of 85 years, I lost 20 years of potential life to the heart attack. But, because I lived 30 years with paralysis after the car crash, the crash cost me the equivalent of 15 years of healthy life. My total health loss is 35 DALYs, a figure that accounts both for the health loss from the fatal heart attack and the health loss from the nonfatal car crash.

Just as baseball and other sports have been transformed by our understanding of new numbers, public and global health can be, too.

In late 2012, the British medical journal The Lancet published a new ranking of the world’s leading health problems comparing deaths and DALYs by cause. In terms of death, scientists reported, lung cancer kills about 200,000 more people than road injuries annually. But measured by DALYs, road injuries are almost two and a half times worse for humanity. That’s because most fatal victims of lung cancer are in their 60s, 70s and 80s, while those most likely to die of road injury are in their 20s and 30s — and road injuries cause almost 40 times more disabilities. If you are an international policy maker or aid agency choosing how much to invest in road safety relative to antismoking campaigns, that’s vital information.

The same kind of analysis works even better at a national level, where most health spending takes place, because current health care gaps usually correlate much more with the leading causes of DALYs than the leading causes of deaths. As Mexico moved to a universal health care system in the last decade, it used this type of analysis to prioritize those treatments — like medications for childhood cancers, and emergency care after a car accident — that reduce DALYs the most.

Australia has used its own DALY calculations to direct close to $900 million in public health program spending since 2009, focusing successfully on curbing tobacco use, childhood obesity and diabetes.

Now people everywhere can bring “Moneyball” to medicine. A few months after releasing their global numbers in The Lancet, the same scientists supplied the underlying figures for 187 nations. These statistics will be updated again later this year. At last report, in the United States, measured by DALYs, the third-largest health problem was low back pain. Fifth is major depressive disorders. Eleventh is neck pain. Thirteenth is anxiety disorders. None of these maladies kill anyone directly, so they don’t even show up on a list of leading killers. But they still cause huge amounts of pain and suffering, and cost our economy billions of dollars in lost productivity.

When will low back pain get the research funds and attention given to lung cancer, just below it in a DALY ranking? The toll from major depressive disorder, No. 5, is estimated to be 20 percent worse than that from stroke. Why don’t we promote early detection in the same way, on public billboards and ad campaigns? Health loss from anxiety disorders is estimated to be 80 percent higher than that from breast cancer. Do advocates for anxiety treatment even have their own colored ribbon?

These are provocative questions, and new statistics in any field are inherently threatening to the status quo. But just because we have always looked at things one way is no reason not to consider alternatives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as improving how we all live and die. We don’t have to take new measures like the DALY as the final word, but they highlight areas for health gain we might otherwise miss. Advanced stats are too important to leave to professional sports teams. We can all try to choose the prevention, detection and treatment strategies that best add years to life and life to years."

Re “Healed by His Own Data” (Business Day, April 1):

The inspiring story of Steven Keating, who discovered his own brain tumor, illustrates how being able to have access to a complete and accurate record of personal health information empowers patients to play a more active role in managing their care.

Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, patients have a right to request a copy of their health records from their physicians. But having access to this information is only the first step. To fully benefit, patients should create their own personal health record, a complete picture of their health history, to track their health and share with doctors when making medical decisions.

The American Health Information Management Association, which represents more than 100,000 health information professionals, advocates for patients’ right to access their health information and continues to support efforts that enable patients and medical providers to gain access to secure, complete and accurate health information.

The money will come from Medicare trust funds that are financed with payroll and other taxes and with beneficiary premiums.

In his budget for 2016, Mr. Obama requested $50 million as a down payment “to support the removal of Social Security numbers from Medicare cards” — a step that federal auditors and investigators had been recommending for more than a decade.

More than 4,500 people a day sign up for Medicare. In the coming decade, 18 million more people are expected to qualify, bringing Medicare enrollment to 74 million people by 2025.

New beneficiaries are often surprised, even shocked, to find that their Medicare cards carry their Social Security numbers. Medicare uses them as the primary means of identifying beneficiaries, placing the numbers on benefit cards along with one or two letters or digits that indicate the basis of a person’s eligibility.

In moving to halt the practice, Congress was motivated by the proliferation of electronic health records and a rash of recent cyberattacks, including a data breach at Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers.

Medicare officials have up to four years to start issuing cards with new identifiers. They have four more years to reissue cards held by current beneficiaries. They intend to replace the Social Security number with “a randomly generated Medicare beneficiary identifier,” but the details are still being worked out.

Paula L. Ercolini, a 70-year-old Medicare beneficiary in Sharpsburg, Ga., outside Atlanta, said she wished that her Medicare card did not include her Social Security number.

“The Social Security number has the potential to open up your files, your life to hackers and thieves,” she said. “But you almost have to provide it when you go to new doctors. They won’t see you if you don’t.”

The card itself tells beneficiaries: “Carry your card with you when you are away from home. Let your hospital or doctor see your card when you require hospital, medical or health services under Medicare.”

Ann H. Rossie, 81, of Seattle, said she worried that having Social Security numbers on Medicare cards “makes us all vulnerable if our wallet is stolen.”

“Changing to another number will be a humongous job,” said Ms. Rossie, a former Social Security claims representative. “But Medicare needs to recognize the terrible impact on anybody whose identity is stolen. It destroys your self-esteem, and it can take years to re-establish your identity and credit.”

Members of Congress said the use of Social Security numbers on the cards provided a case study of bureaucratic inertia.

Since 2004, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, has repeatedly urged officials to curtail the use of Social Security numbers as identifiers. In 2007, the White House Office of Management and Budget told agencies to “eliminate the unnecessary collection and use of Social Security numbers” within two years.

In 2008, the inspector general of Social Security called for immediate action to remove the numbers from Medicare cards, saying their display “unnecessarily places millions of individuals at risk for identity theft.” In that same year, the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs began carrying out elaborate plans to remove Social Security numbers from their identification cards.

But the Department of Health and Human Services, which supervises the agency that administers Medicare, has “lagged behind other federal agencies,” the Government Accountability Office said.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said she was puzzled by the delays. “This still does not appear to be a priority” for Medicare administrators, she said.

Medicare officials said their top information technology specialists had been preoccupied with efforts to build and repair HealthCare.gov, the online system for buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which was overcome by technical problems soon after it began operating 18 months ago.

An internal report cites concerns about “the budgetary and logistical challenges of removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards.” The agency depends on more than 200 computer systems and pays more than a billion claims a year from 1.5 million health care providers.

AARP, the lobby for older Americans, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said they supported the new prohibition.

“Older adults are targeted by fraud artists, who use their Social Security numbers to get loans and credit cards,” said Amy E. Nofziger, manager of the fraud prevention program at AARP.

In one case described by Stephen R. Wigginton, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Illinois, a hospital employee and a former employee were convicted of stealing personal information from the charts of older patients and then using the data to apply for credit cards in the victims’ names.

The former employee was caught on camera at a store using a credit card obtained with the personal information of a 90-year-old woman who had been admitted to the hospital from an assisted living center."

“Liability protection is something needed to help companies share,” said Sarah Beth Groshart, director of government affairs at the Information Technology Industry Council. “And only Congress can provide that.”

Policing the nation’s computer networks has been complicated over the last decade by concerns from Republicans, who expressed concern for burdens placed on the private sector, and from those arguing for more stringent privacy protection in both parties.

The 2013 exposure of the government’s extensive surveillance programs into American lives through the leak of classified documents by Edward Snowden further muddied an agenda that many national security experts insisted was critical to preventing large scale cyberattacks on American infrastructure and businesses. Further, jurisdiction for cybersecurity snaked over an array of congressional committees, making unified legislation at times difficult.

Lawmakers have been grappling with cybersecurity legislation since 2012, when a bipartisan Senate effort twice failed over business concerns that the legislation was putting too onerous a burden on the private sector.

Leon E. Panetta, who was defense secretary at the time, and intelligence leaders implored lawmakers to shrug off the furious opposition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but lawmakers were not persuaded.

A House effort in the last Congress mustered strong opposition from the White House, which was concerned about jeopardizing the privacy rights of consumers.

But since then, a series of cyberattacks has changed the political equation. The attack on Sony Pictures — Mr. Obama blamed North Korea for the attack — thwarted the wide release of a comedy portraying the assassination of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

Early this year, Anthem reported a major breach that exposed the records of nearly 80 million people. Just last week, Target agreed to reimburse MasterCard $19 million for losses associated with the theft of 40 million credit and debit card numbers from its computer network in December 2013.

“We are under attack as I speak,” said Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, Democrat of Maryland. “To do nothing is not an option.”

Privacy advocates continued to express anger legislation Wednesday on the House floor, creating unlikely alliances between some conservatives and left-leaning members.

“We’ve seen before that the federal government has a poor track record of safeguarding our information when entrusted with it,” said Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, on the House floor. “The last thing we should be doing,” is empowering them with more information access, he said. His comments were echoed by Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. “Since 9/11 the government has begun to know more and more about what we are doing, where are, where we sleep, who we love,” he said, while consumers, “have known less and less.”

At the same time, some feel the bill does not go far enough on national security. “I do believe we will see a cybersecurity bill enacted and signed into law,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine who has worked on the issue for years. “But it won’t be as strong as it should be to protect critical infrastructure.”

However security experts said that the government would benefit from the information sharing as well. “The net effect of this legislation will be positive on national security side and economic security side,” said Mr. Kurtz.

The White House issued a statement on Tuesday that commended the effort in the House but did raise concerns about the liability protections offered to private companies in the House bill, raising fears that they would be so sweeping that they might backfire and prevent companies from reporting cyberthreats.

Privacy changes in the bill won over Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and ranking member on the House Intelligence committee, who opposed it last year, and both parties expect the president to come along as well.

The timing for passage of the Senate version of the bill may be impeded by time-consuming amendments. That chamber is already snarled over a bill that would give Congress more say in a nuclear deal with Iran and a major trade measure. The Highway Trust Fund is nearly broke and requires legislative action before the end of the month, and a national security program at issue also requires renewal.

Indeed there is some concern among some Republicans that the bill could become a vehicle for a debate about the broader national security and privacy matters.

The Breaches at Anthem, which is one of the nation’s largest health insurers and operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, and Premera Blue Cross, based in Washington State, were much larger. The one at Anthem may have compromised the personal information of 79 million customers and the one at Premera up to 11 million customers.

Anthem has said the hackers may have stolen Social Security numbers but did not get access to any medical information. Premera said it was possible that some medical and bank account information may have been pilfered.

CareFirst said it was aware of one attack last year that it did not believe was successful. But after the attacks on other insurers, Mr. Burrell said he created a task force to scrutinize the company’s vulnerabilities and asked Mandiant, a division of FireEye, to perform a forensic review of its systems. Last month, Mandiant determined a breach had occurred in June 2014.

Health insurance firms are seen as prime targets for hackers because they maintain a wealth of personal information on consumers, including medical claims records and information about credit card and bank accounts.

In recent years, the attacks have escalated, said Dr. Larry Ponemon, the chairman of Ponemon Institute, which studies security breaches in health care. He said the health care industry was particularly vulnerable and that the information it had was attractive to criminals who use the data to steal the identity of consumers.

“A lot of health care organizations have been historically laggards for security,” he said.

Insurers say they are now on guard against these attacks. But Dr. Ponemon said they had taken only small steps, not “huge leaps,” in safeguarding their systems.

The motivation of the hackers in these cases, however, is unclear — whether they are traditional criminals or groups bent on intelligence-gathering for a foreign government.

In the retail and banking industries, the hackers have been determined to get access to customer credit card information or financial data to sell on the black market to other online criminals, who then can use it to make charges or create false identities.

So far, there is scant evidence that any of the customer information that might have been taken from Anthem and Premera has made its way onto the black market. The longer that remains the case, the less likely that profit was a motive for taking the information, consultants said. That suggests that the hackers targeting the health care industry may be more interested in gathering information.

“It’s such an attractive target and it’s a soft target and one not traditionally well protected,” said Austin Berglas, head of online investigations in the United States and incident response for K2 Intelligence and a former top agent with the F.B.I. in New York. “A nation state might be looking at pulling out medical information or simply looking to get a foothold, which they can use as a testing ground for tools to infiltrate other sectors,” he said.

Paul Luehr, a managing director at Stroz Friedberg, a security consulting firm, said the health care breaches could be an entry point into other systems. “It could serve as a conduit to valuable information in other sectors because everyone is connected to health information,” he said.

Or the breaches could simply be crimes of opportunity. The hackers could be making off with information and waiting to determine what to do with it.

“We want to jump to the conclusion that there is an organized chain and command,” said Laura Galante, threat intelligence manager for FireEye, who was not commenting specifically on any particular breach. “But what could be happening here is much more chaotic. It’s simply, ‘Get whatever data you can get and figure out what to do with it later.’ ”"

Now the focus is on those who have served.,"To ensure that the patterns the system found could be used to predict actual suicide risk, researchers created the algorithm using data from half of the patient population from 2008 to 2011, then tested it on the other half from the same period, said a lead researcher, Robert Bossarte, the director of epidemiology in the V.A.’s Office of Public Health. Predictions for the test population lined up with the actual suicide rates, he said.

The health care field is increasingly using sophisticated algorithms to predict medical outcomes, and the Army already employs a similar database to monitor active-duty suicides, but this is the first time predictive risk has been used to look at veteran suicides on a large scale.

Dr. John Curry, a psychologist who is a professor in the Duke University School of Medicine psychiatry department, said the V.A. database would be useful, and that it appeared to pinpoint more people at risk of suicides “than identified by clinical variables alone.”

He said one challenge would be persuading patients to follow a suicide prevention plan based on how a database assesses their personal risk. “You’d have to work with the patient to accept it,” he said.

The database found that the 1 percent of patients with the highest risk were 12 to 14 times more likely to commit suicide than V.A. patients as a whole. The top 0.01 percent of patients were 80 times more likely.

The top 1 percent of patients tended to be young, single males with several medical problems including sleep disorders, pain and traumatic brain injuries. Most were taking antidepressants and sedatives. More than 90 percent had used V.A. mental health services in the year before their deaths.

Though the database can pinpoint high-risk patients, the V.A. still cannot predict suicide in individuals, Mr. Bossarte said. “The risk score is more like a cholesterol number,” he said. “Just because it’s high does not mean you are going to have a heart attack, but it does mean we should take measures to lower the risk.”

The V.A. is still developing how it will use the data, said Ms. Thompson, the suicide prevention official. “Are we going to call them and say, ‘Hey, guess what, you are at high risk of suicide?’ Of course we can’t do anything like that,” she said. “So we are developing steps our clinicians can take to use this information.”

Many of the risk factors, such as being hospitalized for a psychiatric condition or making a previous suicide attempt, may seem obvious, said Michael Schoenbaum of the National Institutes of Health, who was an author of the study. But researchers found that these high-risk patients, who should have been flagged by doctors and other health care staff under traditional suicide prevention protocols now in place, were not.

“Doctors are pretty bad at assessing risk,” Mr. Schoenbaum said. “The database is so overwhelmingly better than just guessing, which is what we’ve been doing.”"

And on Tuesday, CVS said that it would resign from the United States Chamber of Commerce after revelations that the chamber and its foreign affiliates were engaged in a global lobbying campaign against antismoking laws.

Its stand against smoking has allowed CVS to make alliances with health care providers and rebrand itself fully as a health care company. But with smoking rates on a steady decline, and cigarettes sales slumping, CVS also saw that future profits lie not with Big Tobacco but in health and wellness.

Taking the high road for health has its challenges. For one thing, it means new competitors in a rapidly changing industry. And, for a major retailer with tens of thousands of products on its shelves, it leads to an uncomfortable question: If we cannot sell cigarettes, what does that mean for potato chips?

Road to Growth

The Consumer Value Store started as a scrappy discount health and beauty outlet in Lowell, Mass., in 1963. Four years later, the small chain opened its first in-store pharmacies, and those became the core of the company — and its growth — for years. Larry Merlo, the chief executive, is a pharmacist by training and came into the company when it bought People’s Drug, a drugstore chain based in a suburb of Washington.

In a phone interview, Mr. Merlo spoke mostly in corporate platitudes, but when the conversation turned to the subject of pharmacists, he spoke passionately about pharmacists’ role in delivering health care.

“Hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis,” he said. “It’s the same story — people don’t take their medication as prescribed.”

Pharmacists, who see patients more frequently than doctors do, can make sure patients stay on their drug regimens, he said, keeping them out of the hospital and saving the health care system billions of dollars down the road.

“I think back to my own personal experience,” he said. “Sometimes, it’s as simple as answering questions to get people to stay on their prescription therapies.”

Mr. Merlo said the company stood out in the breadth of products and services it offered: Its MinuteClinics diagnose and treat patients, and its pharmacies dispense medicine to more than two million prescriptions a day. It negotiates the price of medicines and helps 65 million people navigate drug coverage under their insurance plans.

The shift toward health care started in 2004, when CVS acquired Eckerd Stores and Eckerd Health Services, giving CVS a foothold in administering drug benefits to employees of big corporations and government agencies. Two years later, CVS acquired MinuteClinic, a pioneering in-store health clinic chain that was offering treatment for routine illnesses, basic screenings and vaccinations. CVS also expanded its very profitable specialty pharmacy business, which focuses on expensive drugs to treat complex or rare diseases like cancer or H.I.V.

Then in 2007 came the $21 billion merger between CVS and Caremark, which gave birth to the country’s leading pharmacy benefits manager. Three years ago, CVS struck a deal with the medical products distributor Cardinal Health to form the country’s largest generic drug sourcing operation. It followed up with a $2.1 billion acquisition of Coram, a business that allows CVS to dispatch technicians to patients’ homes to administer pharmaceuticals through needles and catheters.

The acquisitions keep coming. In May, it paid $12.7 billion to acquire Omnicare, which distributes prescription drugs to nursing homes and assisted-living operations. Just weeks later, CVS announced it would buy Target’s pharmacy and clinic businesses for $1.9 billion and left open the possibility of pursuing further deals. Once the Target deal closes, CVS will operate about 9,600 retail stores, or about one out of seven retail pharmacies, according to Pembroke Consulting. Last year, the company changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health.

The growth of CVS comes at a time when the way Americans get access to and pay for health care is evolving quickly. Surveys show that many of the estimated 30 million people who gained insurance coverage last year under health care reform do not have a primary health care physician or do not use one. Many, too, opted for high-deductible health plans and are expected to become picky with the dollars they spend, and less tolerant of the opaque pricing that is still the industry’s norm. And consumers in general are starting to demand more convenient, on-demand access to health care, closer to home.

In that fast-changing world, CVS’s strategy is to be a one-stop shop for health care.

“Say you have diabetes, and you go into a pharmacy to get your insulin, how great is it if, in the same aisle, there’s a cookbook for people with diabetes?” said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC’s Health Research Institute. “And maybe there’s some foods that are already approved for you, and a place to check your feet, and a clinician to check your eyes,” she said.

“Consumers are saying: I want all of that at a place near my house that’s open on Saturdays, when it’s convenient for me. I want that place to post prices. It’s in CVS’s interest to pull in more and more pieces of that puzzle.”

A typical CVS clinic staffed by nurse practitioners sees 35 to 40 patients a day; those patients pay $79 to $99 for minor illnesses and injuries, and most insurance plans are accepted. Analysts estimate each clinic typically brings in $500,000 a year, representing just a fraction of CVS’s revenue. Still, the clinics are an important part of the company’s health care proposition.

Other retailers are also getting into the business. The number of retail clinic sites grew to 1,800 locations nationwide in 2014 from 200 in 2006, though they still represent just 2 percent of primary care encounters in the United States, according to a report published this year by Manatt Health, a health advisory practice, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. But CVS is by far the leader. Walmart, which charges just $40 a visit, has fewer than 100 clinics, compared with the more than 900 in CVS’s portfolio. Walgreens, the second-largest, has half as many clinics as CVS. And CVS plans to add more, reaching 1,500 by 2017, the company has said.

Whether these clinics provide the best kind of care is a question sometimes raised by doctors in more traditional practices, like Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a doctor in Milford, Neb.

“These retail clinics, they’re run by competent folks, and they probably have some role to play,” he said. “But you’re being seen at a clinic next to the frozen food section by a stranger. And if you go back for a follow-up, you’re going to get seen by someone else.”

For employers and insurers, however, the clinics offer a way to reduce costs for noncritical conditions. A study by researchers at the RAND Corporation estimated that more than a quarter of emergency room visits could be handled at retail clinics and urgent care centers, creating savings of $4.4 billion a year.

Reducing health care spending, however, may turn out to be complicated.

“You might imagine that they keep people out of E.R., so that’s one way you could save money,” said Martin Gaynor, professor of economics and public policy at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. “On the other hand, just because they’re more convenient, people might go and obtain care in circumstances where they otherwise would not have sought care.”

CVS might have more sway reducing health care costs in its role as a middleman between drug companies and patients with drug benefits. The company is expected to start shifting the balance between end users on one hand, and drug manufacturers and wholesalers on the other.

CVS and other large dispensing pharmacies — Walgreens, Express Scripts, Rite Aid and Walmart — made up about 64 percent of prescription-dispensing revenue in the United States in 2014, according to Pembroke Consulting. That year, CVS was also the leading provider of specialty drugs in North America, with $20.5 billion in revenue, representing 26 percent of the total market.

“Scale is a big factor in pharmacy,” said Joseph Agnese, senior equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “There’s a lot of pricing pressure from drug manufacturers and one way for retailers can come back at them is to become larger, and become a more significant purchaser of drugs.”

Dr. Gaynor of Carnegie Mellon said, however, that cost reduction varied greatly by type of drug. “If there’s a drug that is very important for CVS to carry, and there are no alternatives, they aren’t going to have a lot of negotiating power,” Dr. Gaynor said. “But of course, the bigger CVS gets, the more they can move product, the more important it becomes.”

The company’s size also creates significant competition issues, says David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer and former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission who often represents independent pharmacies. CVS’s ownership of Caremark could restrict consumers’ access to rival pharmacies, he said, and CVS’s acquisition of Omnicare, already a dominant player in long-term care, could reduce competition in that industry.

“There are tremendous concerns when you see someone becoming so terrifically large,” Mr. Balto said. “The acquisitions might conceivably be efficient, but whether those efficiencies are passed on to consumers really depends on the level of competition in the market.”

Quitting Cigarettes

Helena B. Foulkes, who leads CVS’s retail business, swept past the sales counter at a newly renovated CVS in downtown Manhattan. Where cigarette packs once lined up in neat rows, now there were nicotine gum and patches to help smokers quit. (There are no e-cigarettes either, much to the chagrin of that industry, which had hoped CVS would embrace its products as a lower-risk alternative.)

Ms. Foulkes, who lost her mother to lung disease, leads the retail business, which is starting to change to fit the company’s health care bent better.

The move to forgo $2 billion in annual tobacco sales has bolstered CVS’s health care bona fides. The White House lauded CVS’s move. “Thanks @CVS_Extra, now we can all breathe a little easier,” Michelle Obama wrote in a Twitter post. The praise seemed to give Mr. Merlo a jolt of confidence. At a TEDx talk this year in Winston-Salem, N.C., he declared: “CVS kicks butts across the U.S.”

“When we exited the tobacco category, it was the most important decision we’d made as a company,” Ms. Foulkes said. “That decision really became a symbol both internally and externally for the fact that we’re a health care company.”

It also made economic sense. Adult smoking rates have dropped to 18 percent in 2014, from 43 percent in 1965, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and experts predict that rate to dip below 10 percent in the next decade. Ditching cigarettes allows CVS to trade a small — less than 2 percent of revenue — and shrinking part of its business for an instant enhancement of its credentials in the faster-growing health and wellness space.

In October, CVS announced that its Caremark arm would require some of its customers to make higher co-payments for prescriptions filled at pharmacies that still sold tobacco products — in effect driving more traffic to the now tobacco-free CVS pharmacies. While that move encourages pharmacies to quit selling tobacco, it also raised the ire of an antitrust law research firm, which called the announcement “a smokescreen” that masks higher costs for those who fill prescriptions at competing pharmacies.

“CVS’s use of its market power to bludgeon consumers and rivals into ending tobacco sales is not a legitimate form of competition,” the American Antitrust Institute said in a statement. It has urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate.

In general, CVS’s new anti-tobacco stance has helped it forge affiliations with regional hospitals. Before CVS went tobacco-free, negotiations with local health systems were awkward, Mr. Merlo said during a recent analyst conference call.

“That question would always come up — ‘You guys sell tobacco products, don’t you?’ — and that literally sucks all the energy out of the room,” Mr. Merlo said. But since the company stopped selling tobacco, he said, “We’ve been able to accelerate partnerships with leading health systems across the country.”

A new partnership with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago will involve patient referrals and shared electronic health records. Anthony Perry, vice president for ambulatory care and population health at Rush, said that traditional health care providers and companies like CVS could be natural allies.

“Take people with high blood pressure. That’s the type of thing you manage steadily over time, and you work on things like diet and exercise, and lifestyle changes, and if those things don’t work, you get into the world of medications,” he said. “What we asked was: If we’re going to do a series of visits with somebody, might they be able to do some of that closer to home?”

The flip side, he said, is that CVS can refer people with more serious ailments, but no primary care doctor, to Rush. “So CVS can now say: You need to see a primary care doctor, and we can connect you.”

The anti-tobacco stand has had other effects. Notably, the company has had to start thinking about other unhealthy items on its shelves. If it is a company that promotes health, can it also sell sugary sodas and candy bars?

The downtown Manhattan store where Ms. Foulkes walked the aisles is one of 500 locations that CVS is remodeling to emphasize healthy fare.

“I was in Long Island the day after the tobacco announcement, and I ran into a store manager who said: ‘I’m so proud of the company,’ ” she recalled. “But he also said, ‘I’m hearing customers now saying, why don’t you have healthier food?’ ”

“Customers quickly made the leap. They expected more from us,” she said.

Ms. Foulkes pointed to a prominent snack corner at the front of the store.

“What you’ll see in our stores are brands that convey healthy without being overly edgy. It’s Chobani yogurt, it’s Kind bars, it’s lots of proteins and nuts,” she said. “Health for the masses.”

At this point, there are no plans to stop selling high-fat or high-sugar snacks, still a big part of CVS stores’ sales. But they might be harder to spot.

When asked where the Oreos were, she smiled. “You’ll find them, but you’ll have to look for them.”"

But for consumers, the effect is quite different from what the headlines suggest.","This relatively sanguine picture of the impact of data breaches is an example of a threat that looks worse than it turns out to be. The sheer size of hackings shocks and startles when the attacks are first reported, but it’s rare that journalists check on the actual consequences.

Moreover, consumer fears can be stoked by the incentives of the people providing the data. Many of the statistics on identity fraud and online attacks come from security firms that want more people to buy their services. It’s not so different from the soap company that advertises how many different types of bacteria are on a subway pole without mentioning how unlikely it is that any of those bacteria would make you sick.

One of the most memorable statistics on identity fraud comes from advertisements that say a new victim is created every two seconds. That figure, which comes from Javelin Strategy and Research, is largely attributable to standard credit card fraud, in which criminals use a stolen credit card number to buy goods — not the sort of thing most people imagine when they think of identity fraud. The more troubling identity theft, in which new accounts are opened in an unsuspecting person’s name, make up only 5 percent of the total figure given by Javelin.

These statistics do not mean that data security is not a real issue for authorities and consumers to think about. Even if the hackers don’t use your credit cards, there are instances in which leaked data of other kinds can be damaging in itself, as was clear in the recent episodes at Sony Pictures and Ashley Madison, the website that connects prospective adulterers. There are also serious geopolitical concerns about foreign hackers compromising national security if they get a hold of military maps or staff lists from the C.I.A.

For the companies and banks that bear the cost of stolen credit card numbers, the expenses are very real. Criminals racked up $7.8 billion in fraudulent purchases last year, with banks paying 62 percent of that amount and merchants the rest, according to The Nilson Report.

The banks, though, have managed to curtail their costs as they have devised new methods to detect fraudulent purchases. The most prevalent strategy involves looking for patterns in card purchases, but some banks have even taken to buying stolen cards on the black market to identify breaches, security experts say.

In the aftermath of the Target breach, in late 2013, the American Bankers Association said that the biggest expense for the banks was not the fraud but rather the cost of reissuing the cards and dealing with concerned customers.

For JPMorgan, the costs after the 2014 intrusion were much more limited because the attackers took only email addresses and phone numbers, the type of information that is not hard to attain through other, legal channels.

Consumer advocates generally say that the most important thing to pay attention to after a data breach is the type of information stolen. Karen Barney, a program director at the Identity Theft Resource Center, said that to commit true identity theft, hackers generally need to get a hold of Social Security numbers.

“Social Security numbers are the be-all and end-all for successful attempts at identity theft,” Ms. Barney said.

While those nine-digit identifiers weren’t made vulnerable in any of the big data leaks at retailers, they were exposed in this month’s intrusion at U.C.L.A.’s health system and in the recent break-in at the federal government’s Office of Personnel Management.

To prevent fraud in the first place, banks are currently introducing cards with so-called E.M.V. chips, which make counterfeiting cards — currently the most prevalent sort of fraud — much more difficult.

Though serious identity theft has been on the decline in recent years, many security experts are expecting that to change as dedicated criminals, whose easy counterfeiting is foiled by E.M.V. chips, start to focus on getting Social Security numbers and other data that enables them to open new accounts, said Mr. Robertson, of The Nilson Report.

“For the bad guys, your five-year growth plan is not data breaches and stealing credit cards,” Mr. Robertson said. “It involves stealing all the info you can and opening legitimate accounts in people’s names.”

Ultimately, the problem will still require businesses, and individuals, to stop the thefts from happening in the first place."

Contributions are deducted from pretax income, and any contributions you make from personal funds are tax-deductible — even if you don’t itemize deductions on your return. Withdrawals aren’t taxed either, as long as the funds are used for eligible medical costs.

The researchers found that high-income and older tax filers both established and fully funded their H.S.A.s at least four times as often as low-income and younger filers. (It remains to be seen, the study noted, whether the Affordable Care Act changes that dynamic. Many plans sold on government exchanges offer H.S.A.s, but the study ended before the marketplaces began operating.)

Timothy Hayes, a financial planner near Rochester, said the accounts might be attractive to consumers who have funds to invest longer term, because they can be used to pay not only for medical care in retirement but also for costs like long-term-care insurance premiums.

Mr. Hayes said he advised clients that, if they could, they should pay for current medical costs using other funds, and let their H.S.A. contributions grow for future use. Even though it’s convenient to pay for medical care with the debit card that most health savings accounts provide, he said, try to resist the urge: “You’ll be happy to have that money, when you’re older.”

Here are some questions and answers about health savings accounts:

? What is the maximum contribution to a health savings account?

For 2015, the maximum for an individual is $3,350, and $6,650 for a family. (Optional contributions from an employer count toward the total.) In 2016, the cap for an individual remains the same, while the amount for a family will rise by $100, to $6,750; the lack of a big change is because of “tepid” inflation, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.

? Can I make “catch-up” contributions to my H.S.A.?

Yes. If you are 55 or older, you can add an extra $1,000 a year to your account.

? Is an H.S.A. the same as a health care flexible spending account?

No. The accounts sound alike, but have different rules. For instance, you can’t take an F.S.A. with you, if you change jobs."

Lawyers for Dr. Gandhi and his practice, Cardiology Associates of Northwest Indiana, said they had not received any subpoenas, and the doctors denied any wrongdoing.

In recent years, federal officials have brought several prominent cases against cardiologists and hospitals, accusing them of performing unnecessary procedures like inserting stents into coronary arteries. While medical professionals say there is no indication that cardiology has more unnecessary procedures than, say, orthopedics, they do note that the specialty has come under increased scrutiny by regulators because the procedures tend to be reimbursed by Medicare and private insurance at significantly higher levels than those in many other specialties.

“Cardiology, whether we like it or not, is generally a big moneymaker for hospitals,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and the former president of the American College of Cardiology. “We are still a fee-for-service system, and that creates, in my view, misaligned incentives among some physicians to do more procedures and among some institutions, particularly in areas where there is not tight medical supervision, to turn a blind eye and enjoy the high revenue stream.”

While there are various industry and federal guidelines describing when it is appropriate for a patient to undergo certain procedures — Medicare, for instance, says a patient’s arteries must be 70 percent blocked to justify the use of a stent — in the real world, interpretations vary. In extreme cases, physicians have been accused of falsifying medical records, saying arteries were more blocked than they really were.

Last year, a hospital system in eastern Kentucky paid nearly $41 million to settle allegations, without admitting wrongdoing, that it billed for unnecessary coronary stents and catheterizations after a group of area doctors falsified patient records to justify the procedures. The hospital system, Ashland Hospital Corporation, faces 120 private lawsuits from patients who claim they underwent unnecessary procedures.

At Community Hospital in Munster, Ind., Dr. Gandhi was a star. For decades, he ran a prominent practice in the bedroom suburb of 23,000 people about 30 miles southeast of Chicago. He and his partners not only ran the most popular cardiology practice in Munster but were also the highest-paid heart doctors in the state in terms of Medicare reimbursements, records show.

The lawsuits against him have divided the town’s medical community, with some doctors finding themselves in the unusual position of speaking against a fellow doctor, working with the medical malpractice lawyers who are their usual foes.

Besides the doctors, the malpractice lawsuits also name Community Hospital, through the foundation that oversees its operations, as a defendant. Dr. Gandhi was a high-ranking member of the medical staff at the hospital, and the lawsuits charge that the superfluous procedures were done “with the authority and consent” of Community Hospital, one of the largest and most respected institutions in Munster. Lawyers for the hospital deny any wrongdoing.

Some doctors said there had been repeated warnings over the years about Dr. Gandhi’s practice, but those concerns were largely ignored.

When Dr. Mark Dixon, then the medical director of Community Hospital’s electrophysiology lab, where defibrillators were implanted, raised concerns to a hospital executive in 2005 about whether Dr. Gandhi and other physicians were qualified to implant the devices, he said he was shut down.

“The response to me was, ‘I understand your concern, but we have a very large producer here who wants the privilege,’ ” Dr. Dixon said last year in a deposition in a lawsuit. He said he was later told to stop reviewing implants performed at the hospital by the nurse manager of the lab. Dr. Dixon did not return calls seeking comment.

In an email responding to questions, the hospital said Dr. Dixon was never told that Dr. Gandhi was a large revenue generator whose practice was too lucrative to curb, nor was he told to stop reviewing the implants.

Lawyers for Dr. Gandhi, his practice and the hospital, say the lawsuits are without merit. The legal actions, they say, are being driven by envious physicians eager to take patients from Dr. Gandhi and by greedy lawyers seeking a big settlement.

“The physicians at Cardiology Associates have exemplary records as outstanding cardiologists and leaders in their field,” the lawyers said in a statement.

Last fall, Dr. Gandhi retired.

Dr. Arvind Gandhi moved to Munster in 1981 after completing a cardiology fellowship in Chicago. In more than 30 years of practice in the area, he gained a reputation for an attentive but efficient bedside manner. He did not lack for confidence. His mantra was “I saved your life,” several former patients said.

“He was supposed to be the best cardiologist in the area,” said Phil Probus, 86, a retired railroad worker and World War II veteran. In 2013, Mr. Probus had a defibrillator implanted by Dr. Gandhi that a paid consultant later told him was unnecessary, and he is now one of the plaintiffs. “I never questioned anything he did.”

Medicare reimbursement records show that Dr. Gandhi and his partners, Dr. Wail Asfour and Dr. Satyaprakash Makam, received nearly $5 million in combined Medicare payments in 2012, making them the three most reimbursed cardiologists in Indiana. How much they earned from treating patients who had private insurance is not in the public record.

The partners invested in real estate, including luxury apartments in Chicago, and a local restaurant. Dr. Makam was often seen driving around Munster in a blue Porsche with the license plate “Tick Doc.”

“It was a nice car,” said David Wiening, a retired road construction inspector and patient of Dr. Makam’s who is a plaintiff. Over five years, Dr. Makam performed 24 procedures on Mr. Wiening’s legs. Pulling up his pant legs, Mr. Wiening shows off his “ugly walking sticks,” two legs that are bloated and hairless, covered in parts with small lesions. A vascular surgeon paid by the plaintiffs’ lawyers in the case told Mr. Wiening he did not need many of the procedures performed on him.

When asked why the three highest-billing Medicare cardiologists in the state would be found in the same town and the same practice, lawyers for Cardiology Associates of Northwest Indiana said the population in the area was older and sicker than in larger Indiana cities.

Munster’s population is older than those of Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. But David Malenka, a professor of Medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said an examination done at the request of a reporter by researchers of inpatient and outpatient claims for defibrillator implants, adjusted for age, sex and race, showed that Munster’s rate per capita was in the top 10 percent for the country for 2010, 2011 and 2012. The region showed up with some of Indiana’s highest rates per capita for cardiac catheterizations and coronary angioplasties, procedures that, in many cases, can be elective.

When investigators at the Dartmouth Institute studied rates per capita for procedures that must be treated — a hip fracture, for instance — Munster was below average in the state.

“What that says is that for procedures that are more discretionary, they are at the top,” Dr. Malenka said.

Community Hospital, a nonprofit institution, benefited immensely from the flourishing cardiology practice. As at other hospitals, heart procedures are one of its leading revenue engines, according to the 2012 tax filings for the foundation that oversees the hospital.

The foundation that oversaw Community and two other, smaller local hospitals was controlled by one of Munster’s most prominent families. Until his death in April at the age of 95, Donald S. Powers, a local real estate developer, was the foundation’s chief executive. For years, Dr. Gandhi was one of Mr. Powers’s personal cardiologists and treated him after a heart attack. “Dr. Gandhi controlled his medications, did testing and performed several procedures on Mr. Powers,” the hospital said in a statement.

The Powers family still oversees the foundation, the Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana. Mr. Powers’s daughter, Frankie Fesko, is the foundation’s chairwoman, and his grandson, Donald P. Fesko, is the chief executive of Community Hospital in Munster. The hospital declined to make any of its executives or members of the Fesko family available for this article. While one of the foundations, doing business as Community Hospital, is named in the malpractice litigation, no members of the Fesko family have been accused of any wrongdoing in the lawsuits.

A whistle-blower lawsuit brought by a physician and a hospital employee against the hospital, Dr. Gandhi and his practice in 2008 raised similar accusations that the hospital had billed for unnecessary defibrillator and pacemaker implantations that were performed by doctors without the proper credentials to implant the devices.

But the suit, eventually joined by the United States attorney’s office in Hammond, Ind., just north of Munster, was settled without anyone admitting wrongdoing. The hospital paid a $48,942 settlement.

The hospital and the doctors say that the settlement shows that the issues have been investigated and that they have been absolved of many of the same allegations contained in the current malpractice suits.

A little more than a decade ago regulators expanded approval for a combination pacemaker-defibrillator device that, overnight, practically made pacemakers obsolete. Since then, there has been a growing battle over the qualifications necessary to implant the device, which is connected with electrodes to the heart and can send electrical pulses to restore a normal heart rhythm.

A study published in 2009 showed about 71 percent of the new defibrillators were implanted by electrophysiologists — cardiologists who have received specific training in the rhythms of the heart. But, like other hospitals, Community Hospital allowed its medical staff to set credentialing requirements, and it allowed doctors who were not electrophysiologists to implant the devices.

“It’s quite questionable to have complex electrophysiology procedures being done by people who are not formally trained,” said Dr. Nissen, who said he was not aware of the particulars in Munster.

In 2005, after Dr. Gandhi had obtained privileges to implant combination pacemaker-defibrillators, Dr. Mark Dixon, then the director of the electrophysiology program at Community, reviewed some of Dr. Gandhi’s cases. He found several cases in which the patient’s indications, or test readings, did not meet national guidelines for necessity, according to a deposition Dr. Dixon provided last fall for one of the patient lawsuits.

Dr. Dixon said he reported Dr. Gandhi to the hospital’s quality assurance committee. That committee, according to the hospital, had been set up to improve documentation, but not to question whether procedures were necessary. In its statement, the hospital said Dr. Dixon never brought any complaints regarding Dr. Gandhi’s quality of care or appropriateness of implants to the quality committee’s attention. “None of the records were being reviewed for medical necessity of the implant,” the hospital said.

Sitting in the corner of a Starbucks near Community Hospital, Dr. Scott Kaufman nervously sipped a Frappuccino. An electrophysiologist, Dr. Kaufman had concerns about Dr. Gandhi dating back more than seven years when he encountered Gloria Sargent in an emergency room of a nearby hospital. Ms. Sargent was in rough shape, vomiting and with a sustained rapid heart rate.

In late 2006, Dr. Gandhi upgraded Ms. Sargent’s pacemaker-defibrillator device from a more basic one implanted by another doctor just a few months earlier.

Dr. Kaufman turned off the device’s pacing, which sends an electrical shock to the heart to convert it to a normal heartbeat. He studied her electrocardiogram in the emergency room, and it showed she had normal electrical impulses going to her heart’s lower chamber. “She did not qualify for the upgrade and all of the surgeries she went through,” Dr. Kaufman asserted.

Ms. Sargent became patient zero in the litigation against Dr. Gandhi. Last fall, after the plaintiffs’ lawyers handling her case began holding news conferences and running ads in the local newspaper, former patients of Dr. Gandhi began trickling into Dr. Kaufman’s office. So he began working with a group of medical malpractice lawyers, the same lawyers who had twice sued him. Those cases were settled; the Indiana Medical Review Panel found that Dr. Kaufman had done nothing wrong.

“I’m O.K. with working with these guys,” Dr. Kaufman said. “I just want this to stop.”

Dr. Kaufman says that of the 15 former patients of Dr. Gandhi and the Cardiology Associates doctors he has seen, at least 11 did not need the various procedures performed on them. One of those is Angela Webb, 52, who had a pacemaker implanted by one of Dr. Gandhi’s associates when she was in her 40s. After Dr. Kaufman observed her for a few months, he removed it.

“When they took the pacemaker out, they couldn’t understand how I recovered so quickly,” said Ms. Webb, who said she could finally pick up her grandson and have the magnetic resonance imaging tests needed to treat her multiple sclerosis. “I was so happy to have it out.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Lawyers for Cardiology Associates say Ms. Webb’s lawsuit and others are riddled with errors, including, in her case, pages of accusations against Dr. Gandhi, who was not her physician, and lists of procedures that she did not undergo. When asked how her pacemaker could have been removed without medical problems, they said that in cases where devices had been removed because of infection, the devices did not need to be reimplanted in 25 percent of the cases.

The lawyers also note that Dr. Kaufman and Dr. Dixon work together at a practice owned by another hospital.

It will take years for the lawsuits to wend their way through the legal system. In Indiana, each individual case must first go through a medical review panel, a process that can take more than two years. So far, however, the first two cases heard by the panel of physicians, including Ms. Sargent’s case, found Dr. Gandhi and Cardiology Associates “failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care” and that conduct “was a factor in the patient undergoing unnecessary procedures.” The panel did not find Community Hospital negligent.

Debra Davidson is still searching for answers.

Doctors and medical consultants paid for by the malpractice lawyers have now told her she did not need the many angiograms or stents because her heart had no blockages. When she stopped taking the medication she had been on for decades, she lost 30 pounds and began to feel better, she said.

“But did I need this?” she asked, her hand hovering over the five-inch scar on her breastbone where surgeons entered for her open-heart surgery. Mrs. Davidson was sitting in her kitchen, and one of the lawyers present responded with a sad shrug. A physician who had reviewed her medical charts said it is unclear. It does not appear a stress test was done, which could have indicated whether her heart was getting adequate blood flow and whether the surgery was necessary.

She now has advice for friends and family with medical problems.

“If they have a feeling that they don’t believe what the doctor is doing for them is for the best, don’t do what I did and depend on the doctor,” Mrs. Davidson said. “Get a second opinion.”"

As the ancient Britons celebrated the alignment of stone and shadow at Stonehenge, as modern astronomers delight in a solar eclipse, so joy fills my personal universe during the brief intervals when my three major professional passwords converge.

I use each one dozens of times a day to access the hospital systems necessary to write notes and prescriptions and check labs and email. The passwords must be changed every three, four and six months, and I have a strategy for updating each one. But their different rotation rates mean that one or another always needs attention, sapping my concentration and occasionally precipitating disaster. (“Too many unsuccessful attempts! Contact administrator!”)

And then along come the halcyon weeks when they are all exactly the same, a time when mind and fingers fly and I get to think about other things, like the patients in front of me.

In addition to those three passwords, I have quite a few others: one for our old collection of electronic records (whose information cannot be transferred to our present database), two for separate lab computers not connected to the main computer, one for the billing system, one for mandatory online educational activities, one for the residents’ schedule and evaluations. Most of these have their own slow cycles of renewal; I keep track of their rotations on a tattered index card in my pocket.

And I should be grateful for the passwords I do have, because there are quite a few I do not have. For instance, I have no access to the separate electronic records used in our emergency room, so I have little idea what goes on with patients there until they surface somewhere within my digital range. I have no access to yet another system used by most of our outpatient consultants (and they have no access to ours).

Who knows what the biblical stonemasons sang to themselves during work hours at their Tower of Babel. This is the soundtrack at ours: “What exactly did the kidney guy tell you to do?” “Are you sure?” “How did the ER explain that?” “Could you just bring in the new pills next time?”

As it says in Genesis, humans who speak the same language do reasonably well until a higher power makes a series of panicky, poorly thought out software purchases, at which point all productive collaboration grinds to a halt.

In 2009, fewer than 10 percent of hospitals had any kind of electronic medical records. By 2014, 75 percent had at least a basic system, all rushing to comply with the mandate for electronic transactions contained in the Affordable Care Act.

The data do not indicate how many, like ours, are now awash in the products of competing vendors whose proprietary coding specifically impedes inter-system collaboration. Nor are there yet any algorithms for untangling the wires of a system as rich in different languages as ours.

The rush to electronic information was prompted by the best intentions. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, “using electronic health records will reduce paperwork and administrative burdens, cut costs, reduce medical errors and most importantly, improve the quality of care.”

No one in our Tower debates those goals; we struggle daily to accomplish them, and often, incredibly, we succeed.

We succeed with the simple expedient of paper.

Paper has become our lingua franca, our fallback and standby. In our new digital universe, we have peculiarly seen a retro explosion of paper. We may no longer write paper prescriptions, but we fax or hand-deliver paper versions of our electronic dealings routinely now. When you don’t know what electronic language the receiver speaks (and you never do), you go with paper.

Furthermore, one of our systems automatically prints out a paper health summary for every patient we see — even for patients who have established a confidential electronic portal into the system. We cannot seem to turn the print feature off. We press these summaries into our patients’ hands or, if they say no thanks, we leave the sheets in the printer to be shredded. That’s about a ream of paper a day right there.

A few months ago, on a day when morphing passwords had messed up my entire morning, I stopped in the public ladies’ room next to our work space. There, teetering atop the trash can, was one of these paper summaries. It contained (in boldface type) the name, address, date of birth and medical record number of one of my patients, her medical diagnoses, prescriptions, next appointments, and her own ultrasecret password to set up that confidential patient portal.

So much for the secure exchange of health information, so much for the best electronic intentions, so much for whatever order and control are implied by all those passwords. I could hear the arches of our poor tower crack just a little more. I folded the papers into my pocket so I could put them in the shred pile later."

Then one day, he was gone.","I HAD heard stories of doctors disappearing — gone, suddenly, their offices closed and no forwarding address to be found — but I never expected it from my physician of 12 years. After weeks of phoning his office, I finally reached him. He referred to himself in the third person: Dr. J. was unavailable, the practice was closing and if I wanted my medical records, I should come fetch them.

This was a man who had peered into my nose and mouth, performed prostate examinations and talked me through afflictions. He knew I was married, had children, and what I did for a living. That he would skip town without notice seemed an abrupt ending. He didn’t even tell my health insurance provider that he had shut his doors.

When I arrived the next day, the doctor handed me my records and said he was closing the practice and moving it to Texas. He had not notified anyone because there were too many patients to contact, an explanation I accepted without contention, the way I had adopted so much of his advice over the years.

Everyone seems to have a health care provider they swear by — a dentist who can pull teeth without painkillers, a chiropractor who can realign spines one-handed. “My doctor is the best,” I’ve heard countless friends say. Rarely do they say “my doctor is the worst” — partly because people don’t usually stay with bad doctors very long, but also because bad doctors aren’t always obvious, at least until they do something obviously bad. Like, say, suddenly closing their practice and relocating 2,000 miles away.

In hindsight, there were signs I did not have the best practitioner. The nurses were fresh out of school, using my veins for target practice as they stabbed for blood. I was often prescribed serious medications for mild ailments. I was once left in an examination room for over an hour. When I emerged half-dressed in a cheap gown to check on the wait, a receptionist apologized, saying the doctor had left for the day. He had forgotten about me.

Doctors are a responsible lot, generally speaking, but sudden departures are not unheard-of. According to Lori Jenkins, a health care consultant in Clifton Park, N.Y., closing a practice without notifying patients is often a sign of business troubles, personal problems or impending malpractice suits. All the while, a patient might have no idea what lies behind the stethoscope. “You see things happening, but think it’s normal,” she explained."

Moore of Alpharetta, Ga., said he had great difficulty obtaining hospital records for his 4-year-old son, Oliver, who has a rare genetic disorder and has seen at least eight medical specialists in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Boston.

“The hospital in Atlanta was very slow to respond,” Mr. Moore said. “We had to escalate our request to the hospital leadership to get the records.”

Mr. Moore said insurers had spent $800,000 on care for his son, generating several thousand pages of medical records.

“Some doctors seem to believe that medical records are intended only for doctor-to-doctor communication, and that patients would not understand those records,” Mr. Moore said. “We want the records so we have control over them — so we can provide them to any doctor who sees our son.”

Under the new guidelines, a health care provider cannot require patients to pick up their records in person if they ask that the records be sent by mail or email. A health care provider cannot deny a request for access to health information because a patient has failed to pay medical bills. A doctor or a hospital may charge a fee to cover the cost of copying, but cannot charge for the cost of searching for data and retrieving it.

Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said consumers needed access to their records so they could “take more control over decisions regarding their health,” follow treatment plans and correct errors in the files.

In addition, Dr. Collins said, some people want access to their records so they can contribute information to biomedical research projects like President Obama’s “precision medicine” initiative.

Researchers working on the project will collect data on the health, genetic characteristics and lifestyle habits of a million or more volunteers.

The same rules that protect the privacy of medical records also give patients a right to see a broad array of health information about themselves. The rules were issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Doctors and hospitals are supposed to provide consumers with access to personal health information within 30 days and, in some cases, can extend the deadline by 30 days. But, the administration said, most requests should be fulfilled in fewer than 30 days.

Melinda R. Hatton, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said the guidelines were “a helpful reminder.” Hospitals, she said, “strongly support patients’ access to their medical records,” and many have web portals that let patients view information about their care.

But Deven McGraw, a deputy director of the Office for Civil Rights, said complaints about access to medical records were one of the top five issues investigated by her agency.

Megan O’Boyle of Arlington, Va., whose 15-year-old daughter has intellectual disabilities, autism and epilepsy, said, “It burns me up that I had to jump through hoops to get her records.”

She said she wanted copies so new doctors could see the history of her daughter’s illness and would not have to repeat medical tests and imaging procedures.

“It’s empowering when you get all this information,” Ms. O’Boyle said. “You can be a much better advocate for the patient. More information is better. It means better services for my daughter.”

For patients with chronic illnesses, the fees charged by doctors and hospitals for providing medical records can add up. “Why should I have to pay 25 cents to 50 cents a page for what really belongs to me in the first place?” Ms. O’Boyle asked.

Joy L. Pritts, a former privacy officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, said that “many health care providers still don’t understand that patients have a right to get their medical records,” and she suggested a possible reason.

“It may be contrary to the financial interests of health care providers to give patients broad access to their medical records,” Ms. Pritts said. “Once patients have that information, they can share it with competing health care providers.”

Under the rules, doctors and hospitals do not have to disclose psychotherapy notes that are kept separate from the rest of a patient’s medical record.

Health care providers may also deny requests if the disclosure of personal health information is “reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety” of a patient or another person. Thus, certain information might be denied to a suicidal patient.

But, the administration said, this exception is to be narrowly construed."

This discovery came after the researchers reviewed more than 1,400 patient records, and identified an obvious pattern among those with ovarian cancer who were using beta blockers, most often to control their blood pressure. Women taking earlier versions of this class of drug typically lived for almost eight years after their cancer diagnosis, compared with just three and a half years for the women not taking any beta blocker.

The researchers are now preparing follow-up clinical trials of ovarian cancer patients. My guess is they will confirm the connection.

This information was lying in plain sight, no invasive procedures or testing required. We could have found it years earlier if we had had the data.

Here’s another recent example. In 2015, researchers at Stanford University and the Houston Methodist Research Institute analyzed more than 16 million clinical documents from some 2.9 million patients and discovered a connection between prescriptions of a certain kind of heartburn drug and heart attacks. One in 15 Americans takes these drugs, the so-called proton pump inhibitors (P.P.I.s) such as esomeprazole (Nexium), omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid). The study found that they can increase your risk of a heart attack by about 16 percent, regardless of whether or not you have an existing heart condition.

This conclusion came from simple data mining, and confirmed earlier research conducted in 2013 and published in the journal Circulation indicating that P.P.I.s could potentially lead to long-term cardiovascular disease by changing the lining of blood vessels. Patients who were prescribed another type of heartburn drug, however, had no increased likelihood of heart attack.

I get that patients are nervous about releasing their health records. Studies have shown that even anonymous strings of DNA data can be linked to individuals. Patients understandably don’t want their acquaintances and employers to know all their private health information. But we cannot let these fears suppress the powerful insights medical data can offer us. When I explain to my own patients what can be done with their information for the greater good in research, nobody has ever said to me, “Don’t use my data.”

We all go to a machine on the street where we insert a plastic card and cash comes out; we log into our online accounts to check our balances and pay bills; and we give credit card numbers that contain a key to our financial information to retailers without a second thought. But if I asked you to put your de-identified personal health information online, or share it and perhaps some bio-specimens with people other than your own doctors, you might panic. “Health data is not the same as financial data,” you might say.

We need to move past that. For one thing, more debate over data sharing is already leading to more data security. Last month a bill was signed into law calling for the Department of Health and Human Services to create a health care industry cybersecurity task force, whose members would hammer out new voluntary standards.

New technologies — and opportunities — come with unprecedented risks and the need for new policies and strategies. We must continue to improve our encryption capabilities and other methods of data security and, most important, mandate that they are used. The hack of the Anthem database last year, for instance, which allowed 80 million personal records to be accessed, was shocking not only for the break-in, but for the lack of encryption.

We also must block attempts to discriminate based on health information for work or other pursuits with continued legislation, and portray those who participate in the sharing of health data as heroes. In fact, they are heroes: They are part of tomorrow’s cures for themselves and their children. We also need to revisit the cumbersome and obsolete privacy rules enacted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to make it easier for patients to participate. One idea is to establish a trusted middle “broker,” such as a dedicated nongovernmental agency, that can ensure that every effort is made to keep records anonymous before their release for research studies.

Medical research is making progress every day, but the next step depends less on scientists and doctors than it does on the public. Each of us has the potential to be part of tomorrow’s cures."

My interest was broader and national: How often are hospital security personnel using Tasers and guns today? Have other patients been harmed? Who is providing hospital security? I know that hospitals can be dangerous places, but what do we know about whether those weapons make hospitals safer? So as the Pean family pondered its options, I did other reporting.

I called the organizations that accredit hospitals, government regulators, experts on health care security, and hospitals themselves and was surprised by what I found. There is no requirement that the shooting of a patient or the use of a Taser has to be reported, so there were almost no statistics — just some occasional mentions on police blotters and local news reports.

Researchers from Duke University and the University of Texas had recently completed the only national survey on how many hospitals armed security staff and found that about half said they did; this is almost double the number reported in smaller studies just three years before. (The Taser company has been marketing aggressively.)

When I started calling hospital systems to ask about security, the answers I got were all over the map. Some huge urban hospitals, like Bellevue in New York City, ban all weapons. Other tiny suburban hospitals use them. Many big hospital systems — like Johns Hopkins and Emory — refused even to tell me if their security guards were armed, saying it was sensitive information. (I admit I became obsessed: Every time I visited a hospital with a sick relative, I was staring at the security officers’ hips for telltale bulges.)

I also discovered that the training of hospital security officers was highly variable: One hospital that used Tasers did so only after putting in place rigorous guidelines as to when and how they could be used in a health care setting. They fired guards for inappropriate use. Other hospitals merely hired what one expert called “rent-a-cops,” who received little additional instruction about the fundamental difference between how to approach a street criminal and a sick patient.

Eventually, I interviewed Alan and, ultimately, met the entire Pean family, one Sunday morning at The New York Times, when they were in from Texas. A close-knit clan with Haitian and Mexican roots, the family is filled with professionals — doctors, nurses and teachers. They were articulate and thoughtful about how Alan’s harrowing brush with death had changed their worldviews.

It struck me that our readers should have an opportunity to hear directly from Alan and his family. I floated the idea with Catrin Einhorn, a wonderful Times multimedia journalist. We toyed with putting audio clips into the article, but decided that scattered sound bites wouldn’t do the story justice and so started thinking about a possible podcast. After getting the go-ahead from The Times, Catrin approached Ira Glass, the host of “This American Life,” who was enthusiastic about the possibilities. We felt confident that the more issue-oriented tone of a Times special report and the more personal/emotional tone of a “This American Life” podcast would be complementary rather than compete for readers’ attention.

Making sure the two pieces dovetailed with each other has been a fascinating, fun … and exhausting process. We hoped the audience would want both and invite you to let us know what you think.

In the end, the most difficult task was to get responses from the hospital or the police, which both basically went dark.

As you’ll hear in the “This American Life” piece, a crisis manager hired by the hospital told us that it would not answer questions. The police wouldn’t comment, citing an active internal investigation. We managed to get some records through Freedom of Information requests (but only a heavily redacted incident report). After months of legal argument, we got the hospital to release Alan’s 1,000-plus-page medical chart (with his permission, of course).

For me, the big question that remains is just how many patients are threatened or shot with Tasers or guns in hospitals today. Especially if there are no serious injuries, would we even know about it? The most vulnerable are patients with mental illness, who may not be aware of their rights or even what is happening. The Pean family, filled with doctors, knew where to complain. Others may not.

I asked Scott Martin, head of security at the University of California, Irvine, Medical Center, how often weapons are deployed in hospitals across the country. At his hospital, which has a Taser program, there is extensive training and officers must report each instance in which he or she displays or deploys a weapon. But others are not so rigorous. He said: “It’s hard to know. It’s like if a tree falls in the forest and there’s no one there to hear it, is there sound?”"

Conway, chief medical officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, keeps one foot on the front lines as he works to improve the health system.","Dr. Conway, 41, has a say in almost every significant or controversial health care policy change contemplated by the Obama administration.

He is devising a new way of paying doctors under Medicare, as required by a 2015 law, the biggest change in payment policy since 1992. He is responsible for deciding whether Medicare will pay for new items and services, like PET scans to help detect Alzheimer’s disease, or counseling patients about end-of-life care. He also leads efforts to measure the quality of care provided by doctors and hospitals, so the government can tie its payments to their performance.

And by using financial rewards and penalties, he is trying to nudge doctors and hospitals to provide better, safer, more coordinated care at a lower cost.

“Our fee-for-service system is broken,” Dr. Conway said. “It causes fragmented care. It pays not for outcomes but for outputs. It causes volume-driven care. So the question is, ‘How do we shift that payment model?’ ”

Dr. Conway said his experience at the children’s hospital here had contributed directly to changes in federal policy, including a new rule that expanded the role of dietitians. In addition, he said, “using electronic health records as a physician in practice has informed the way I think about policy, both what’s good and what needs to be improved” — to ensure that electronic records “do not disrupt the doctor-patient experience.”

Some experts say federal efforts to measure the quality of care, though well intentioned, are out of control.

“We need to stop excessive measurement,” said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, who headed the Medicare agency in 2010-11 and recruited Dr. Conway to be the chief medical officer. “I vote for a 50 percent reduction in all metrics currently being used.”

The National Academy of Sciences has expressed concern about the proliferation of quality measures, including nearly 1,700 used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Many doctors doubt whether the government can reliably assess their performance. In the second round of incentive payments, announced this month, far more doctors received financial penalties than bonuses.

“It’s like a lottery,” said Anders M. Gilberg, senior vice president of the Medical Group Management Association, referring to the payments. His organization represents physician groups.

Despite skepticism or outright resistance from some health care providers, Dr. Conway exudes a boyish enthusiasm for his work.

He acknowledges that critics have a point. “We do want to focus on smaller sets of measures when possible,” he said. He promised that the government would concentrate more on the results of care, not just whether doctors gave the recommended tests and treatments.

Consumer advocates like Debra L. Ness, the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, see Dr. Conway as a kindred spirit who understands what is important to patients. “He has the experience of being a clinician, a direct provider of health care services, but also has an incredible grasp of the administrative and policy aspects of health care,” Ms. Ness said.

Some of that insight comes from firsthand experience. Dr. Conway was expelled from the delivery room when his wife received an epidural injection while giving birth to their fourth child last year.

“C.M.S. says you have to leave the room,” said a nurse anesthetist, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Conway complied with the request, he said, though he later checked and found that the agency had no such regulation.

Dr. Conway was the youngest of four children, and he realized that he liked working with children when he was a camp counselor in his teens. He received his bachelor’s degree at Texas A & M, where his father was a chemistry professor and his mother was an assistant dean at the business school. He went to Baylor College of Medicine and did his residency at Boston Children’s Hospital, where he met his wife, Heather, a pediatric intensive care nurse.

In 2007, during the Bush administration, he came to Washington as a White House fellow and worked for Michael O. Leavitt, who was then the secretary of health and human services.

“I have no idea whether Patrick is a Republican or a Democrat,” Mr. Leavitt said. “He came to government not for politics, but for policy.” Voter registration records list the doctor as unaffiliated with any political party.

When Dr. Conway speaks to groups of doctors or hospital executives, they often complain that federal rules are rigid and oppressive. But he has a way of disarming critics.

After one speech, he recalled, a doctor buttonholed him and said: “I always thought C.M.S. was evil. But you’re not evil. You seem very nice. I could work with you.”

His zeal to improve care is rooted in personal experience. He was frustrated, he said, at the fragmented care that his father, Dwight Conway, received when he was dying of cancer in 2007.

He promised his father that he would devote his life to trying to fix the health care system. His father told him: “You can’t. It’s too hard. But you are persistent. If anyone can, it would be you.”

Dr. Conway also supervises the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, a test bed for new ways of financing and delivering care. In one such project, Medicare will make a “bundled payment” for hip and knee replacement surgery and 90 days of follow-up care, forcing hospitals to work more closely with doctors, nursing homes and home health agencies.

Federal officials are continually trying to measure the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, and Dr. Conway applies similar techniques to his personal life. He has a large whiteboard at work to keep track of office projects, and on one side is a mission statement he and his wife wrote, outlining objectives for family life, including ways to be a good father and husband.

“He evaluates his performance against those objectives,” said Wesley R. Perich, a former deputy in the office. Using one such metric, Dr. Conway said, he got home for dinner with his family about 75 percent of the time.

Some doctors worry that the administration is trying to do too much too fast, without considering the effects on patients.

“Dr. Conway is a very smart man, and he is trying lots of innovative programs and ideas,” said Dr. Thomas C. Barber, the chairman of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons’ Council on Advocacy. “But some of those ideas are being implemented before they are ready.”

Among those providing unvarnished feedback to Dr. Conway is his sister, Dr. Kathleen C. Jurell, who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation.

“I hear from her about C.M.S.,” he said, “and it’s not always good.”"

Sometimes, before I interview new patients, while I’m waiting for them to be transported from the emergency department to the medical floor, I play a game.

I look through their lab tests. I peruse their imaging studies. I read other doctors’ notes and recent discharge summaries. Then I guess what the diagnosis is.

I know this is bad. It goes against most of what I learned about good doctoring in medical school — that the patient’s story is the core of medicine, that it’s essential for accurate diagnoses and therapeutic relationships.

It can also be dangerous. When I interview patients, I often find their medical charts are littered with inaccuracies. It’s one reason “read it in my chart” isn’t a good way for patients to communicate health information — or for doctors to learn it.

“I noticed you’re scheduled for surgery next week,” I say to one patient.

“I had that surgery three months ago,” he responds.

“So you don’t have diabetes?” I ask another, perplexed. I see “diabetes” clearly indicated in her chart.

“No! Why does everyone keep asking me that?” she exclaims, exasperated.

When I read a patient’s electronic health record, I now assume what’s written there is as likely to be wrong or outdated as it is to be accurate. Sometimes these discrepancies are minor and inconsequential; sometimes they can be devastating. And unlike what happens in Vegas, what’s written in your medical record often stays with you forever.

One study found that there’s complete agreement between medications listed in the electronic health record and what patients actually take only in about 5 percent of patients. Another study found that 43 percent of medications listed in the electronic health record were inaccurate — with 29 percent having been stopped and 14 percent changed. Many allergies and adverse drug reactions aren’t recorded. Research from the Veterans Health Administration found that 60 percent of patient records had at least one error. From 2013 to 2014, the percentage of lawsuits related to electronic health record issues doubled and is expected to rise.

The ease with which doctors can copy and paste the information in a medical record can be one source of error — as well as a potent source of “note bloat”: notes so filled with extraneous information that you have to scroll through pages and pages of nonsense to find anything useful. Almost all doctors use the copy-paste function when writing notes, and by some estimates between half and three-quarters of daily notes are copied text. There are advantages: Forwarding text for stable patients can be safe and efficient — and a majority of doctors believe it doesn’t hurt patients. But, if not done carefully, it can perpetuate false or outdated material.

Another problem is that large amounts of patient information are now automatically imported into patient notes. Cognitively, it’s a very different experience searching for, confirming and personally recording aspects of a patient’s history than it is reviewing what’s auto-populated into your note. In some cases, one can “write” an entire note simply by clicking a few boxes to indicate the duration and frequency of a patient’s symptoms — essentially the same way you fill in a Mad Libs template

What can get lost in all this is the patient’s story.

Eliciting, distilling and communicating an account of what’s happened in a person’s life are skills that are vital for all doctors, but especially for doctors in training still learning to care for patients. Gathering and sharing a patient’s story offers the fullest sense of who a patient is as a human being, why he might have received this treatment, for example, and not that one, and what the best course of action might be going forward. We now spend two hours a day reporting quality measures, but what needs to be mandatory in the age of digitalization is the art of story gathering and storytelling.

One solution may be to encourage more patients to read their medical records. Doctors may be motivated to write more thoughtful and accurate notes if they know their patients will be reading them. While patients have had the right to access their medical records since 1996, when the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was enacted, and the right to electronic copies since 2009, most patients never see their charts.

Research suggests that only about 40 percent of patients are offered online access to their medical records. Of those given access, only half choose to view them — but 80 percent of those who do find it useful. A quarter of patients remain unaware of their right to an electronic copy of their medical records. But patients who frequently access their medical records may be more motivated to take control of their health — and in a better position to correct outdated or erroneous information.

The federal government recently released guidelines making it easier for patients to access their records, requiring hospitals to provide electronic copies within 30 days of a request and prohibiting them from asking patients to state a reason for their requests. The government’s Blue Button Initiative also aims to empower patients, allowing them to directly download personal health data in an easy-to-read format.

The push to digitize health care has its upsides. But what’s too easily forgotten is the patient’s story, a coherent narrative of who a person is and what he or she has been through. As medicine continues to modernize, we can’t afford to lose this ancient art.

But in many others, government inaction and structural obstacles like a shortage of home health care aides have often made nursing homes the only option. South Dakota was singled out last week by federal officials who threatened to sue if the state did not fix its problems.

More than 1.4 million Americans live in nursing homes, but it is hard to know how many of them could move back home. Federal data suggests that about 155,000 nursing home residents have a low need for round-the-clock assistance. And about 217,000 people are of working age, another group that experts say could function well at home. But long-term care experts said that some residents who are sicker might also be good candidates to leave.

Sharon Overall of Fenton, Mo., 65, who entered a nursing home for what was to be a month of rehabilitation after injuring her spine, ended up spending 18 months there, losing her house, car and life insurance policies with nearly all her income going to the nursing home.

When Latrell Head, a 32-year-old single father in Atlanta, entered a nursing home after a leg amputation in October, workers there for a while would not allow him to leave to see his 8-year-old son or search for an apartment. Such facilities typically require relatives to sign residents out. “A prisoner has more rights than I have,” he said he felt.

Mariussi Ogando-Rodriguez, 29, said she feels lonely among the hundreds of mostly older residents at the Manhattan nursing center where she has lived for three years. A former accounting student and cashier at Chipotle, she needs dialysis three times a week, but could care for herself. Gesturing toward a group of people watching television last week in a recreation room that smelled like urine, she said, “Sometimes I feel desperate.”

A range of factors conspire to prevent residents from leaving. In many states, Medicaid programs restrict home health services, limiting the hours of care, for example. Waiting lists are common. Mentally ill people, for whom nursing homes are shelters of last resort, are particularly difficult to place. And everywhere, it seems, affordable, accessible housing for disabled people is in short supply.

Living at home is not the right choice for everyone, of course, even with assistance. Some people are too ill. Managing aides can be daunting, and family members might not be able — or willing — to care for relatives or share their homes, particularly when cognitive skills are impaired. For those without family, living alone can be isolating.

Still, about half of Medicaid spending on long-term care now goes toward services in the home or community, compared with less than 20 percent two decades ago, though that varies widely by state. Health care officials predict demand for in-home services will only grow as the population ages. Emily Johnson Piper, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said, “The baby boomers in Minnesota and across the country have the expectation that they will be offered and afforded availability of services for them to live out their retirement years in their communities.”

Many states have concluded that caring for people at home is more cost-effective. Washington State, for example, has found that its costs for one nursing home resident would pay for home care for seven people. Alabama calculated that it cost the state about $25,000 a year less, per person, to offer care at home.

The few studies that have compared the outcomes of people in nursing homes with those cared for at home have reached mixed conclusions. In one recent study, researchers surveyed thousands of former nursing home residents. They reported significant improvements in satisfaction and fewer unmet needs for help with personal care. However, more than three-quarters of them said they had visited an emergency room or been admitted to a hospital or nursing home during the first year of living in the community. Some advocates have also raised concerns about abuse in unregulated home care.

Representatives of the nursing home industry acknowledged that many residents do not need to remain in their facilities. But they said better alternatives were required.“If there is no one with the state to help coordinate that transition process, then there is nowhere for that person to go,” said Mike Cheek, a senior vice president at the American Health Care Association, which represents for-profit nursing homes.

South Dakota has one of the worst records in the country. Nearly 17 percent of its nursing home population is classified as having a low need for the services provided in an institution, among the highest percentages of any state, according to an AARP report.

Shane Bear Heels, 48, has spent more than a quarter of his life in a small nursing home in White River, S.D., overlooking a horse pasture and open field. Most residents there are members of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is nearby.

A quadriplegic since crashing his car in 2001, Mr. Bear Heels said he receives good medical care and takes pride in helping his fellow residents. But he also yearns for more independence. He said he would like to spend more time outside, but the unpaved roads and dearth of sidewalks in the area made that difficult.

“I definitely would like to be in a different setting,” said Mr. Bear Heels, who worked as an electrician before his injury. “Who wants to be like elders?”

He needs help repositioning his body while sleeping and getting into his motorized wheelchair. But once situated there, he is mostly self-sufficient until bedtime. He uses his mouth to maneuver the chair, flip through television channels and send emails. But for now, he appears stuck.

Like some other nursing home residents, Mr. Bear Heels said he has no one who could serve as his advocate and does not know where to turn for help to live elsewhere. (Federal rules now require nursing homes to ask residents at least quarterly whether they want to talk with someone about living in the community and, if so, connect them with a local agency.) He does not own a house, and even if he did, finding reliable home health care workers would be difficult. Many aides, who are relatively low paid, cannot afford cars to reach clients in rural areas like his.

In its report, the Justice Department acknowledged that South Dakota’s geography and limited work force posed challenges, but it also said that the state had not made better use of existing programs, including one that places disabled people in small, family-style group homes. The state has moved only 10 people home from nursing facilities since 2013 as part of a federal grant to do so, according to the federal report. Kim Malsam-Rysdon, South Dakota’s secretary of health, said state officials agreed that community-based care was preferable in many cases, but that “it’s just a balancing act of the ideal and reality.”

Minnesota faces some of the same challenges, but it has managed to move more than 3,000 people from nursing homes to the community since 2010 through one program. Others provide alternatives so people do not have to enter nursing homes.

Accomplishing that has not been easy, state officials said: Each person needing support requires a network of people and organizations to address housing needs, provide assistive technologies and find grants and programs to cover these costs.

Minnesota and other states, such as California, allow public funds to be used to pay family members for the care they provide. In San Francisco, Alice Wong’s parents turn her at night to prevent bedsores and work with aides hired by Ms. Wong to provide much of the near-total care she needs because of a progressive nerve disorder, spinal muscular atrophy. “It’s the best of both worlds,” said Ms. Wong, 42, the founder of the Disability Visibility Project. “All disabled people should have that choice across the country.”

Mr. Dawkins, the former nursing home resident from Baltimore County who was paralyzed, said the vulnerability he sometimes feels at night when he has no aides to help him is outweighed by the control he has over his daily activities. At the nursing home, he often had to wait up to an hour for a response after pushing his call button, he recalled in an interview, and aides would wake him at 3 a.m., when it suited their schedule, to dress him for church services hours later.

It was on a ride to church that he met an advocate who helps nursing home patients apply for support services to live independently. He sued the State of Maryland, which had denied him Medicaid funding for at-home care, but he won the assistance two years ago. Now he has a job going door to door at nursing homes, including the one he left, identifying residents interested in following the same path.

“I’ve had people when I told them about the program cry, break down and cry,” he said."

Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. His latest entry in the debate is his new book, “The Rise and Fall of American Growth.” Mr. Gordon contends that the current crop of digital innovations does not yield the big economic gains of breakthrough inventions of the past, like electricity, cars, planes and antibiotics.

The optimists are led by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, co-directors of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. They argue that there have always been lags between when technology arrives and when people and institutions learn to use it effectively. That has been true for a range of technologies, including the electric motor and the internet, which contributed to the last stretch of healthy productivity growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The gains from current tech trends like big-data analysis, artificial intelligence and robotics, they say, will come. Just wait.

Some economists insist the problem is largely a measurement gap, because many digital goods and services are not accurately captured in official statistics. But a recent study by two economists from the Federal Reserve and one from the International Monetary Fund casts doubt on that theory.

Technology spending has been robust, rising 54 percent over a decade to $727 billion last year, according to the research firm IDC. Despite all the smartphone sales to consumers, most of the spending is by companies investing in technology to increase growth and productivity.

But an industry-by-industry analysis, published by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, found that the march of digital technology across the economy has a long way to go. The McKinsey researchers examined 22 industries, measuring not only investment but also the use of technology to change how work is done. Some industries, like technology, media and financial services, were well along, while others, like health care and hospitality, trailed.

Only 18 percent of the American economy is living up to its “digital potential,” the report concluded. And if lagging industries do not catch up, we will not see much of a change in national economic statistics, said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Since the financial crisis, the Obama administration has moved aggressively to push medicine into the digital age. As part of the economic recovery package, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. The legislation provided for federal incentive payments of $44,000 a physician to shift to electronic health records.

The billions of dollars in subsidies were intended to accelerate adoption. And from 2008 to 2014, the share of hospitals with electronic health records rose to 75 percent from 9 percent, while the adoption rate in doctors’ offices rose to 51 percent from 17 percent, according to the most recent surveys by the American Hospital Association and the government.

“The government funding has made a huge difference,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. “But we’re seeing little evidence so far that all this technology has had much effect on quality and costs.”

The electronic records, health experts say, represent only a first step toward curbing costs and improving care. “People confuse information automation with creating the kind of work environment where productivity and creativity can flourish,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national health technology coordinator in the George W. Bush administration. “And so little has gone into changing work so far.”

The government incentives came with timetables for adopting different levels of use and new reporting requirements, with the prospect of financial penalties for doctors and hospitals that fell behind. The early goals for adopting electronic records were reasonable, health experts say, but the later stages were too aggressive.

Overwhelmed doctors protested, and the administration recently shelved the previous timetable, stretching out schedules and modifying some reporting rules.

Healthstar Physicians, the 50-doctor group in Morristown, Tenn., where Dr. Sutherland practices, was spurred to go electronic by those federal incentive payments, which now total $32 billion. But the cultural adjustment to digital technology has been challenging.

Dr. Sutherland and his colleagues evaluated several technology providers and chose Athenahealth, which does not sell software but is paid a percentage of its customers’ revenue. Healthstar started using Athenahealth’s cloud software in 2012, first for billing and then for electronic health records. Athenahealth’s share is less than 5 percent of the group’s revenue.

Today, Dr. Sutherland’s personal income and the medical group’s revenue are about 8 percent below where they were four years ago. But in 2015, both his earnings and the revenue of Healthstar, which employs 350 people in 10 clinics, increased slightly, by nearly 3 percent from 2014.

Dr. Sutherland decided he did not want a computer screen separating him from his patients. So he opted for a tablet computer, making it easier to keep eye contact.

Not a fast typist, Dr. Sutherland decided to use voice recognition software. For six months, he stayed up until midnight most nights, training the software until its speech recognition engine could transcribe his comments into text with few mistakes.

Dr. Sutherland bemoans the countless data fields he must fill in to comply with government-mandated reporting rules, and he concedes that some of his colleagues hate using digital records.

Yet Dr. Sutherland is no hater. Despite the extra work the new technology has created and even though it has not yet had the expected financial payoff, he thinks it has helped him provide better information to patients.

He values being able to tap the screen to look up potentially harmful drug interactions and to teach patients during visits. He can, for example, quickly create charts to show diabetes patients how they are progressing with treatment plans, managing blood glucose levels and weight loss.

He is working harder, Dr. Sutherland says, but he believes he is a better doctor. Blunt measures of productivity, he added, aren’t everything. “My patients are better served,” he said. “And I’m happier.”"

Enrollment is scheduled to begin in November or December, with a goal of signing up a million or more people within four years.

“There are a lot of enticing reasons to participate,” said Mark Masselli, president and chief executive of the Community Health Center in Middletown, Conn., one of a half-dozen clinics chosen by the government to recruit patients. “Perched on your shoulders will be the best and brightest researchers, working on your behalf.”

The project is being orchestrated by Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, who in a previous job led the government’s successful effort to map the human genome.

Congress in December provided $130 million to the National Institutes of Health for the million-person research cohort. Mr. Obama has requested $230 million for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, and the appropriations committees in both houses of Congress have approved the request as part of a spending bill for 2017. That bipartisan support strongly suggests that the project will continue after Mr. Obama leaves office.

The scale of the project dwarfs most other population-based health research in the United States, such as the Framingham Heart Study, which has produced valuable insights on heart disease by following about 15,500 people enrolled at different times since the late 1940s.

“In the Precision Medicine Initiative,” Dr. Hudson said, “we hope to follow people for at least a decade. The longer it lasts, the more value it will have.”

People can sign up through academic medical centers at Columbia University, Northwestern University in Illinois, the University of Arizona and the University of Pittsburgh, each of which is working with local partners. Columbia, for example, is collaborating with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Harlem Hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine.

Participants will be recruited to reflect the geographic, racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the nation. To help achieve that goal, officials have enlisted community health centers, where more than 90 percent of patients have annual incomes less than twice the poverty level (less than $23,760 for an individual). About one-third of health center patients are Latinos, and about one-fourth are African-Americans.

Officials said they wanted patients to be partners in the research, not just “human subjects.” To that end, patients will have access to all the information about themselves, including laboratory and genetic test results. Doctors could eventually use the data to shape treatment for an individual patient, rather than using standard treatments that may not work for everyone. Patients will help guide the research, sitting on its steering committee and advisory board.

The government intends to collect data from online questionnaires, physical exams, electronic health records and activity-tracking devices like Fitbit. Using smartphone apps and wearable sensors, participants could report information on their blood pressure, heart rate and other vital signs.

Officials hope to recruit 150,000 patients from community health centers. Anne Kauffman Nolon, president and chief executive of Hudson River HealthCare, a community health center serving 10 counties of New York, said her patients would need help to overcome several obstacles. The patients, she said, include homeless people, migrant seasonal farm workers, people with low literacy skills and people who have neither computers nor smartphones.

Dr. Carmen Chinea, the chief medical officer of the Hudson River health center, said that participants would not receive instant gratification, but could eventually receive “more precise treatments” for conditions including diabetes, cancer and depression.

The Mayo Clinic will create a huge biobank to collect, analyze and store 35 million samples of blood, DNA and other materials from participants. Vanderbilt University will operate a data center to store information. Some of the data will be made available, without personal identifiers, to researchers and “citizen scientists,” officials said.

Cancer doctors already choose drugs for certain types of cancer based in part on genetic characteristics of tumors. Dr. Joshua C. Denny, the principal investigator for the project at Vanderbilt, said his research had identified genetic mutations that increase the risk of heart attack or stroke for people taking a certain blood-thinning medication.

Dr. Rhonda K. Trousdale, chief of endocrinology at Harlem Hospital, said she was reaching out to church and community leaders to seek their help in publicizing the project and enrolling volunteers.

“A big motivation for researchers is to use this data to find correlations between people’s lifestyle, family history, environment and genomic data — to figure out what factors contribute to disease and if they affect different populations in different ways,” Dr. Trousdale said. “That’s what precision medicine is about.”"

As President Obama’s graying hair suggests, the American presidency is perhaps the most grueling and stressful political job there is. This year, both major party candidates for that job are past the nation’s customary retirement age. And while submitting health records is not a requirement for the job, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be doing American voters a great service by furnishing a much clearer picture of their physical health than the abbreviated and sunny reports provided so far.

What brings the health issue to mind, of course, is the video of a stumbling Mrs. Clinton being hustled away from the 9/11 memorial service in New York on Sunday. She reappeared some two hours later to say she felt great. Hours later, her doctor issued a statement saying Mrs. Clinton had been suffering from pneumonia — a diagnosis Mrs. Clinton had received two days earlier and which came as a surprise even to some members of her campaign team.

Mrs. Clinton had coughed her way through multiple appearances last week, insisting it was nothing more than “allergies,” while her campaign pushed back on reporters who noted her coughing, telling one to “get a life.”

Mrs. Clinton has released more information about her health than Mr. Trump has about his. Mr. Trump’s evaluation consists largely of a terse and bizarre report written by Dr. Harold Bornstein, his gastroenterologist, who, after a brief examination, said that if elected Mr. Trump, a self-professed fast-food addict, “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Mrs. Clinton’s record, consisting mainly of a letter written by her personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, on July 28, 2015, is more than a year old and, while acknowledging her problem with blood clots, could use some updating.

In recent years, presidents and presidential candidates have been more forthcoming about their health than their predecessors. Franklin D. Roosevelt, a polio survivor, was seldom photographed in his wheelchair, and in his last re-election campaign concealed the cardiovascular disease that would kill him within a year. John F. Kennedy struggled with a debilitating back injury and denied he had Addison’s disease, a serious adrenal gland disorder."

Hackers working on behalf of governments can match stolen Yahoo account data with their own material or information available on the criminal underground and published on the website WikiLeaks for a variety of purposes, Mr. Kanuck and other intelligence officials say.

At this point, they’d have a lot to work with. In the two years since Yahoo believes the hackers first penetrated its network, state-sponsored hackers have stolen tens of millions of records from the insurance companies Anthem and Premera Blue Cross, including Social Security numbers, health records, birth dates, addresses, emails, passwords and employment information — basically, everything you’d need to know about a person.

Hackers amassed a vast collection of security clearance records, even fingerprints, in a yearlong hacking of the United States Office of Personnel Management. They have breached law firms and accounting firms, and last year they even made off with flight records for millions of United Airlines passengers.

It may sound like a crazy collection of unrelated information. But it is not that difficult to make connections among seemingly random bits of information using data-sifting technology.

Just as a corporation may use big data to figure out what a consumer might buy based on their past purchases, a spy agency can use big data to make connections to useful intelligence. A Palo Alto, Calif., company named Palantir sells this technology to American intelligence agencies, allowing them, for example, to match travel records and personal data to identify possible terrorists.

So while Yahoo’s announcement on Thursday that state-sponsored hackers — the company did not say what country it believes they are working for — had made off with more than 500 million customers’ personal records was stunning to many, intelligence officials say it can be seen as just the latest step in an escalating nation-state digital warfare campaign.

“A lot of people overlook why some of these seemingly purposeless breaches matter,” said Mr. Kanuck.

Intelligence services could use this information for a range of things — some trivial and some intrusive. They could match international flights taken by their own officials with those taken by American personnel to the same cities at the same time. They could comb the user names and emails released in a hacking of Ashley Madison, the online affairs site that was breached last year, with the personal Yahoo accounts of government officials and contractors or their spouses, and leak that information online or use it for blackmail.

And they can use the most intimate details of people’s lives — their medical records — to undercut the reputations of prominent American athletes, as Russian hackers did in a release of medical records stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency that belonged to the gymnast Simone Biles, the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams and other Olympic athletes.

The biggest worry, Mr. Kanuck and other American intelligence officials say, is the impact these data thefts can have on global politics. James. R. Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, warned Senate officials earlier this year that Russia was escalating its espionage campaigns against United States targets.

“Russia continues to take information warfare to a new level, working to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within Russia and globally,” Mr. Clapper said in his annual worldwide threat briefing in February.

Intelligence officials and private security researchers say it’s not just prominent United States government officials that Russian hackers are after. It’s their spouses, staff members, lawyers, accountants and business partners, who may not have the same level of security on their data and communications.

“In the past year, we’ve seen personal webmail accounts and social network accounts specifically being targeted by Russian, Chinese and Iranian espionage operators, on several occasions,” said John Hultquist, an espionage analysis manager at FireEye, the security software company. “That’s where some of the most sensitive conversations take place, and hacking private accounts leaves a much lighter footprint.”

One of the most adept at this approach, Mr. Hultquist and other security researchers say, has been a Russian intelligence hacking group alternately known in the security and intelligence community as APT28, Fancy Bear or Pawn Storm. The group regularly uses the compromised personal webmail accounts of staff members, spouses and their colleagues as tools to glean more information on high-level government targets.

In just the last few months, the group has been blamed for attacks on the Democratic National Committee, the White House and the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Going back to last year, the Russian group also has been trying to break into the online accounts of 2,600 members of the Washington elite — lobbyists, journalists, officials, contractors and even their spouses, according to private security researchers at Trend Micro, the global security company, who briefed intelligence agencies on the hacking.

Among the Russians’ targets were Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, whose personal emails caused a sensation when they were leaked online last week, according to people with knowledge of the briefing who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

“This is the new normal,” said Tom Kellermann, one of the security experts who briefed intelligence officials last year in his former role as chief security officer at Trend Micro. “It’s not just the usual targets who are being hunted. It’s their spouses.”

Mr. Kanuck said no one should be shocked that this is going on. “Every prominent person in Washington, every publicly known intelligence official, congressman and significant staffer should presume they have been targeted,” Mr. Kanuck said. “You’d be a fool not to think that’s the case.”"

But why not try?","This is an exercise that most people could benefit from. So here are the steps I took and the obstacles I encountered along the way.

PEDIATRICIAN This was an excuse to catch up with Dr. Frederick M. Cahan, “Uncle Fred” to me as I was growing up. He’s a family friend and still plying his trade.

He’s also a self-described hoarder, but he did not have my records. Within minutes, however, he put his hands on those of my twin siblings, who were born in 1976. So if you’re 40 and under, you might call the medical professional who gave you your first talk about “funny” cigarettes.

INSURANCE The biggest mystery I hoped to solve was that of occasional (and still unexplained) elevated liver enzymes. The result showed up in a 2006 life insurance medical screening. At some point after that, I saw a specialist and had an ultrasound, which didn’t show anything alarming.

But who was the doctor? There was nothing in my filing cabinet at home, and my primary care physician had no record of referring me. I was pretty sure that Aetna was my insurance provider at the time. Could it send me copies of every explanation of benefit it had ever produced for me?

The phone representative was encouraging, but first I had to sign a release. I had the choice of faxing it back or dropping it in the mail, and I chose fax. The reply would take weeks.

As soon as I started in with the various fax machines in my office, however, I knew I’d made a mistake. The first didn’t work. The second, a combination copier-fax-scanner, screeched a bit, at which point I remembered the stories I’d read about how they store images and leave users vulnerable to identity theft. That one didn’t seem to work either, so I moved to Machine 3.

The next day, a colleague approached my desk. She handed me 53 copies of the Aetna form, each of which had my Social Security number and date of birth on it. Machine 2 had belched them out, one by one, at some indeterminate point.

DATABASES I also hoped to figure out what drug I took in 2009 that did not agree with me. What was it again? At first, I couldn’t remember the name of the doctor who had prescribed it, so I checked in with two companies that provide reports on people’s prescription records. They sell access to life and other insurance companies, which ask applicants to grant them permission to do a sort of medical background check.

“Wouldn’t it be great if you could gather deeper insights into your applicant’s potential mortality risk?” the website of one of the services, ScriptCheck, cheerily asks insurance companies. It would also be great if consumers could see what ScriptCheck has on them, but the website doesn’t offer any information on how to do so. So here’s the phone number to request a free report: 844-225-8047.

I wasn’t able to get this one right away, but it turns out that I’m destined for disappointment. A spokeswoman for ScriptCheck’s owner, Quest Diagnostics, told me that the outgoing message on the above phone number’s voice mail asks for your insurance company’s name for a reason: ScriptCheck will give you only the prescription data that it gave the insurance company, going back seven years. So a request next week based on a 2013 insurance application will yield information from the application date and before. And my hunt for 2009 data based on my last life insurance application, which was in 2006, would yield nothing.

A ScriptCheck competitor, IntelliScript, moves more quickly and offers information for consumers on its website. Within 24 hours, I got an email response letting me know that the company had no information on me in its files.

According to the FAQ page on its website, no report exists until an insurance company asks for one. IntelliScript would not comment on why it had no information about me. It and ScriptCheck get their information from pharmacy benefit managers, who are legally allowed to pass it on.

I also requested my file from MIB, an organization of insurers, which may contain other data on my medical and insurance history. It, too, takes some time to arrive.

MENTAL HEALTH Intensely curious about what, if anything, your therapist is scribbling down about you? Alas, the federal law that grants you the right to request your medical records specifically gives mental health practitioners permission to withhold their psychotherapy notes.

According to the American Psychological Association, some state regulations may make it easier to get these notes. If you don’t believe that any observations in the file could lead to a psychological setback, ask for the notes and see what happens, keeping in mind that some notes may have been early musings about diagnoses that did not turn out to be accurate.

DOCTORS My encounters with various physicians yielded mixed results, and it didn’t always depend on the age of the records. My primary care doctor was an early adopter of electronic medical records, and I was able to confirm via his website that my last liver test several years ago was normal.

For another physician, who I’ve seen intermittently for back trouble over the years and visited once in the last year, I had to make my records request via fax. The person answering the phone at his office would not let me make my request by email.

This year, I broke a bone in my arm, so I wanted a scan of the initial X-ray. I thought I could show up at the office and scan the image with my phone, but the rules there prevented it. Instead, I have to wait for a full copy of the X-ray, which I don’t actually want.

But at least it was available. No one gave me a hard time for merely making these requests, which is a good thing, since federal law generally requires health practitioners to hand over your records, though they are allowed to charge reasonable copying and mailing fees. Only one of my doctors charged me anything, but it can be costly for people with more extensive records.

My best luck came in the place where I had the lowest expectations. I knew I’d had a round of travel vaccinations in 2005, but I wasn’t sure where, and my filing cabinet turned up nothing but an incomplete vaccination record with no doctor’s name on it. I had a vague sense that the office was in Greenwich Village, so I made a list of travel medicine specialists near there and started dropping in on them.

One looked familiar, and after talking to three people in the office and waiting around for 10 minutes, one of them ushered me to her workstation. My name didn’t turn up in her initial search, but when I told her the approximate dates of the possible visits, she started pulling thumb drives out of the top of her desk drawer. Within a few minutes, she found my file and hit the print button.

Thanks to my hounding and her doggedness, I won’t repeat the hepatitis A vaccine for at least another decade. She was pleased, too. Had the office sent all the records away to a scanning service, I asked? No, she said, she had done it all herself.

How long did that take? “Years,” she said. “Boxes and boxes and boxes.”"

Mr. Wyden, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, recently talked to The New York Times about the privacy-versus-security debate. Cecilia Kang

Q. What is the state of encryption and other security debates on Capitol Hill?

A. This is going to be a big, big two months.

First, obviously, there are those who want to weaken encryption. They are still at it.

Then, the F.B.I. wants authority to circumvent court oversight to obtain Americans’ browsing histories. Third, there is what’s known as Rule 41, where the F.B.I. wants the authority to hack thousands or millions of hacking victims with one warrant from a single judge.

These and other issues will come up right when we get back in session in November, after the election.

A draft proposal released in May by Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina and Dianne Feinstein of California to give law enforcement greater access to encrypted devices never caught on. What is the status of encryption proposals?

You’ll have to ask them, but if an anti-encryption bill gets out of the Intelligence Committee, which is where its strength is greatest, I will do everything I can to prevent that. If it goes to the floor, then I will filibuster. I will use every procedural tool to block legislation that in my view would make us less safe and jeopardize our liberty.

There seems to be no change in the standoff between companies that want strong personal privacy and security protections, and law enforcement, which argues that it needs to get past encryption for national security.

There were tens of thousands of news stories during the first days of the encryption discussion that said, “Today, in the ongoing debate between privacy and security, the following happened.”

I don’t think that’s the right way to think about it. I think it is about more security versus less security. If you want to be in a safe community, you shouldn’t be able to weaken encryption.

We pushed back very, very hard on the idea that this is a battle between privacy and security.

Is this a minority point of view or are you seeing more people adopt this?

I think you are starting to see surprising voices in this discussion, like Mike McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, raise questions about what it means to weaken encryption.

What else is coming up for consideration in the cybersecurity space?

Browser spying. Senators John McCain and Richard Burr have a proposal to give any F.B.I. field office new authority to scoop up Americans’ browsing history and a slew of American digital records without going to a judge. Email, text message logs and certain location information would be included. We had a vote on this at the end of June.

Yet this would give law enforcement access to valuable information to aid in investigations.

My view is that if you know a person is visiting a website of a substance abuse group, a political organization or mental health clinic, then you know a lot about that person. It’s practically a window into their innermost thoughts. This should come with court oversight. The F.B.I. can already get this information with a court order today.

One thing that civil liberties groups have protested is what’s known as Rule 41. Can you explain what that is?

It would allow the government to hack into multiple devices with a single warrant from a single judge. The Justice Department will say this is a modest thing. But one tech person said this whole Rule 41 thing is coming forward under “cover of dullness.”

The F.B.I. says that the changes to Rule 41 are the best way for them to investigate cybercriminals, including child abusers. What’s your response?

Everyone believes that the F.B.I. should have the tools it needs to catch dangerous criminals. But too often over the past decade, intelligence and law enforcement agencies choose approaches that sweep up information from millions of innocent Americans instead of targeting terrorists and criminals. These approaches don’t make us safer.

The changes to Rule 41 allow the F.B.I. to hack millions of victims of cybercrime. These victims of hacks are regular people, not criminals.

This is a serious issue that the American people and their elected representatives should consider and debate, rather than allowing the Department of Justice to put into law through an obscure bureaucratic process. There would be overwhelming congressional support for something that gives the F.B.I. the tools it needs, while providing the American people the strong protections they deserve.

Is the encryption debate between tech companies and law enforcement unsolvable?

It will be a long debate. But look, it’s still possible to use metadata when the government thinks there is a problem. On the security side, we are no longer collecting millions of phone records on people, so that’s solid policy.

Huh?","I was the first physician to work full time for a daily newspaper, in 1969. Aaron Sorkin, the creator of “The West Wing,” wrote me into the script because of my experience asking a number of real presidents and political leaders the kinds of questions other journalists did not: probing ones about their personal health. My coverage of the health of political leaders began in 1972 when the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota, dropped his running mate, Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri, less than three weeks after choosing him at the last minute at the convention. Because of the stigma of mental illness, Mr. Eagleton deliberately withheld that he had endured three hospitalizations for depression and received electroshock therapy twice. In doing so, Mr. Eagleton created a political liability for his potential boss and president by raising an important question about trust: What else might the vice-presidential nominee have withheld?

In the early years of our nation’s history, Americans paid little attention to the health of presidential candidates for three main reasons. First, people lived from day to day not knowing when they might fall ill. Second, medical knowledge about most diseases was rudimentary; doctors had few tests to evaluate a patient’s health and little to offer patients. Third, even when journalists got wind of a political leader’s personal problems, they rarely wrote about them.

As medicine became more sophisticated, a number of candidates for the presidency and other offices, as well as their families and doctors, distorted information and were evasive when directly questioned regarding the documents they released about their health. Some even lied. Hiding their ailments was not new for politicians. For many, their nature was to convey an image of robust, if not perfect, health out of fear that voters might react negatively to disclosures about health problems.

In bits and pieces, the public first learned about the seriousness of hidden presidential illnesses long after the incumbents left office. Examples: President Grover Cleveland underwent secret cancer surgery on a ship off New York Harbor. President Woodrow Wilson’s wife and doctor controlled White House affairs while he remained paralyzed from a stroke during the last 17 months of his second term. President Franklin D. Roosevelt readily acknowledged his polio, but his White House doctor hid the severe high blood pressure that led to heart failure. President John F. Kennedy’s family denied he had adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease).

The McGovern-Eagleton fiasco pushed the issue of the health of political candidates to the forefront of public attention. Eight years later, in 1980, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan raised transparency about a candidate’s personal health to a new level. A few days short of his 70th birthday, and seeking to become the oldest man to be inaugurated president, Mr. Reagan responded to questions about his “old age” and his mental status by asserting that his doctors would attest to his excellent health.

After a discussion with A.M. Rosenthal, then the executive editor of The Times, I sought to interview Mr. Reagan and his doctors. It took months of constant calls, and persistence in reminding Mr. Reagan’s aides of his previous promise, before he agreed to the interviews. What would he do if his mental faculties declined as president, I asked in an interview that is believed to be the first in which a president discussed his health prospectively. He answered, in a story that became important in that election cycle, with a pledge to resign under such circumstances.

Getting a candidate’s health information often requires enormous perseverance. When candidates dispense details sparsely and are reluctant to answer questions, and their aides actively discourage reporters’ probes into a subject about which the aides may know little, then speculation about hidden illnesses flourishes, with or without merit.

In the election cycles after Mr. Reagan, I interviewed many candidates for the presidency and, when questions arose about their health, candidates for other elected offices. Among them: President George H. W. Bush, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Kansas Senator Bob Dole, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley and former Massachusetts Senator Paul E. Tsongas, who was the first known cancer survivor to run for president. His doctor said he was cancer-free five years after he underwent a bone-marrow transplant for lymphoma. But then I reported that he did have a recurrence. Mr. Tsongas died a few days short of what would have been the end of his term if elected.

But other candidates refused my requests. Among them: President Barack Obama (whose doctor wrote a single-spaced, undated letter that omitted important information), Arizona Senator John McCain (who excluded all Times reporters from attending key news conferences) and Vice President Dick Cheney (who repeatedly refused interviews).

No law requires candidates to disclose their health information. However, my efforts at The New York Times have resulted in helping to make such disclosure as routine and standard as releasing financial records. Candidates now vet a potential running mate’s health information to avoid another McGovern-Eagleton fiasco. The Times has played a major role in these developments by creating a new area of journalism that has paid huge dividends. With rare exception, in recent years there haven’t been any surprises about significant ailments that candidates have tried to keep hidden from the public. In 1994, nearly six years after leaving the White House, Mr. Reagan told the world that he had recently received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. In 1997, I extensively interviewed his doctors, aides and others who knew him. Neither then nor in continuing interviews have I found evidence that he showed definitive signs of dementia as president.

Politicians are not forced to seek office. In running, they become public figures and yield much of their privacy. While there is no direct correlation between a politician’s health and performance in office, ill health can affect anyone’s ability to function. So it seems prudent for the public to insist on candidates’ transparency in disclosing their health information and providing medical assurance that they have a reasonable chance of serving a full term in good health. My experience has convinced me that no ailment should disqualify an individual from seeking office. But the candidate should inform the public beforehand about such an illness.

Serious gaps in disclosure of candidates’ health information have occurred in recent election cycles in part because news organizations relaxed their commitment to informing the public about what was and was not known about the health of a noncooperative candidate or one who delayed disclosure.

In this election, age is an important factor, because in eight days Hillary Clinton, 69, or Donald J. Trump, 70, will become one of the nation’s oldest presidents. (If Mr. Trump is elected, he will be the oldest.) Yet voters still have less than full accounts of their health. Until last month, the information Mrs. Clinton released was more than a year old. In December 2015, Mr. Trump released a bizarre letter from his doctor claiming that he would be the healthiest president ever — without any supporting medical evidence — inviting speculation and mockery. In August 2016, Mr. Trump’s doctor said he wrote the brief letter in five minutes.

As Mrs. Clinton discovered, secrecy about personal health problems involves the risk that medical events will force the issue and cause people to attach greater seriousness to the development of a new ailment. Her campaign was jolted when she nearly collapsed from dehydration while under treatment in September for a bacterial pneumonia that she hid not only from the public but also from her closest staff. That event forced Mrs. Clinton to authorize her doctor to update her medical history and include new information about an old episode.

Then, in a tit-for-tat move, Mr. Trump authorized his doctor to issue more somber — though still incomplete — information.

After the original “West Wing” episode ran, I was flooded with calls. Even The Times’s public relations team chided me for not having told them in advance about my role in the series, expressing skepticism that I knew nothing of it beforehand. Similar calls still come as new viewers discover the show. Perhaps a sign of our times is that people remember my appearance/nonappearance on “The West Wing” more than they do my stories about the health of political leaders that led to and followed it."

Donald J. Trump, who was propelled to the top of the Republican ticket in part by nagging economic anxiety and voter anger among the white working class, doubled down on the negatives on Friday. At a rally in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump labeled the latest jobs report “an absolute disaster,” and said “nobody believes the numbers anyway.”

Hillary Clinton has emphasized President Obama’s success in digging the country out of the recession, pointing to 73 consecutive months of job growth in the private sector. “We got some good news this morning,” she said on Friday at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. “I believe that our economy is poised to really take off and thrive.”

Yet Mrs. Clinton, too, acknowledges wide pockets of economic discontent. “We need to make sure the economy is working for everyone,” she added, “not just those at the top.”

Those repeated economic dirges have stuck in many voters’ minds, echoing like a jingle you can’t get out of your head.

Unemployment Going Into the Polls The October unemployment rate in a presidential election year has rarely been this low. The last time it was lower was in 2000.

Even if it is out of sync with their personal situation, “people’s perception of seemingly objective information is very much influenced by what they hear from their party candidates and leaders,” said Thomas E. Mann, a resident scholar at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

“The more dystopian views that Republicans have is basically a consequence of what they’re hearing from Donald Trump and other Republicans,” Mr. Mann explained. As for Mrs. Clinton, he said, she wants to make clear that she is not ignoring the plight of people who are struggling.

Mark J. Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University in Virginia, agreed that campaign messages can sometimes drown out other signals. “Many people who feel their own personal situation is improving are still inclined to believe the rhetoric,” he said.

More than seven years after the recession ended, employment gains have been remarkably steady, finally leading to a noticeable rise in earnings. Consumers are confident enough to open their wallets and spend. Gas is cheap, home prices are bouncing back and interest rates are low.

Since 2010, 15 million jobs have been created. With unemployment below 3 percent in some metropolitan areas like Denver and Madison, Wis., many employers now complain about a shortage of qualified workers.

“It has been tough to hire good people” at a starting salary of $12 an hour, said Scott Nash, the founder and chief executive of Mom’s Organic Market, which operates more than a dozen grocery stores between Virginia and New Jersey and employs more than 1,000 people.

The combination of turnover rates and higher wages suggests that workers, particularly those equipped with higher education and advanced skills, are more willing to take a risk and quit a current job in search of a better one.

“There are more middle-skill jobs at higher salaries,” said Ian Siegel, chief executive of ZipRecruiter, which distributes jobs postings primarily from small and midsize businesses. “It’s a great time to be a job seeker.”

Many Wall Street analysts said the positive economic news would make it even more likely that policy makers at the Federal Reserve would increase the benchmark interest rate before the end of the year.

Still, the financial crisis and the slow-but-unspectacular expansion have left visible scars. Overall economic growth has remained modest. Despite recent improvements, the recovery has failed to deliver to many Americans the sense of job security and steady advancement that traditionally girds the middle class.

The type of jobs created is one reason. “Where we are creating jobs is in service areas, which are not as productive as manufacturing, and lower paying,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon. “So we’ve got a problem.”

The economic divide has political shadings. Counties where President Obama scored highest in the 2012 presidential election contained more workers in new economy sectors like technology and health care.

By contrast, many areas that swerved heavily Republican four years ago were more likely to rely on traditional blue-collar industries like manufacturing, agriculture and trade.

While the health care, financial and business and professional service sectors kept chugging forward, 53,000 manufacturing and nearly 11,000 mining jobs have disappeared in the last year.

The rise of temporary gigs and unpredictable work schedules have also contributed to the sense of instability.

Corners of the labor market remain in the shadows, as people who could potentially work instead sit at home, so discouraged about their prospects that they rarely bother to look. Overall participation in the labor force has been dragging below 63 percent, down from over 66 percent before the recession. Scraping by on disability payments or help from family, some in this group, including former factory workers, might be lured back — but only by the right job at the right wage.

For older workers and those who have been unemployed for months or years, age discrimination or outdated skills have shut down routes back to work.

Yawning inequality continues to divide the ultrawealthy and everyone else.

“A sense of struggle and a belief that things are not going to change and this is the new normal has fueled a lot of the angst in this politically charged environment,” Mr. Rozell of George Mason University said.

While noting the startling disconnect between the data and the campaign rhetoric, Mr. Rozell said many in the middle-class had been genuinely squeezed. “This is not merely a perception but a reality,” he said, “that they’re either running in place or falling a little bit more behind.”

But for all the challenges, there are clear signs that the job market has markedly improved and that the economy is continuing to advance.

“The main message from the payroll report: Jobs are being created and earnings are going up,” Mr. Reinhart of Standish Mellon said. But it is also a report that “goes right down the middle of the fairway,” he said, which means “you can spin it either way.”"

Enforcement operations would ramp up, with widespread raids in communities and workplaces.

Mr. Trump is also likely to expand detention centers along the border for illegal crossers, ending the Obama administration’s practice of releasing many families who have come fleeing violence in Central America so they can seek asylum in immigration courts. Mr. Trump has said he will punish so-called sanctuary cities, which have curbed their cooperation with the immigration authorities, by withholding federal funding.

He has also said he will temporarily halt all Syrian refugees coming to the United States. He has pledged “extreme vetting” for other refugees, including an “ideological certification” by which they would have to show they share American values. He said he would halt immigration from regions of the world that are “compromised by terrorism,” although he has not specified what countries he means.

And he has said he will tighten scrutiny throughout the immigration system, including on foreigners who come to work or to reunite with their families. Although the system already has crippling backlogs, Mr. Trump wants to further reduce legal immigration from its current levels — but he would need the approval of Congress for that.

Climate Change

The shift in Washington comes just as the United States has been assuming a leadership role in combating climate change, and it will almost certainly upend the world’s efforts to curb the impact of global warming.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied the science of human-caused climate change, incorrectly calling it “fictional” and saying it was a hoax created by the Chinese. He has said that he will do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama’s ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.

While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete gutting of Mr. Obama’s existing climate change regulations, Mr. Trump could significantly weaken or slow them. And in sending a message to the rest of the world that the United States does not intend to enact a climate change agenda, the Trump presidency could cause reluctant governments such as those in India and Poland to slow or weaken their efforts to cut planet-warming emissions.

Mr. Trump has vowed to “cancel” the Paris Agreement, the 2015 deal in which nearly every country put forth plans to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. In fact, it is not possible for a world leader to unilaterally block or undo the accord, nor would it be possible for the United States to legally withdraw from it for at least the first term of a Trump administration. That is because with Mr. Obama and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urging other countries to ratify the accord rapidly, it entered into legal force last week. Any country wishing to withdraw must wait four years to do so.

But even though the United States, the world’s second-largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions, remains legally bound to the Paris plan for four years, there will be no legal consequences or economic sanctions if Mr. Trump does not follow through with the Obama administration’s commitment. Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.

Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. Currently, the rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and failing to argue for the rules, President Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.

Beyond Mr. Trump’s remarks challenging the science of climate change, he has taken steps to translate those views into policy. The head of environmental policy on his transition team is Myron Ebell, who directs energy and environment policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and has gained national prominence for his polarizing skepticism of climate science. Also informing Mr. Trump’s transition team is Michael McKenna, an influential Republican energy lobbyist who has urged Republican lawmakers to deny climate science.

Health Care

Mr. Trump has promised to repeal Mr. Obama’s singular domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, and Republicans in Congress have shown the way. Republicans will not have the 60 votes in the Senate needed to pass most major legislation, but through a parliamentary procedure called budget “reconciliation,” they have already done a dry run to gut the existing law without facing a Democratic filibuster.

“Trump can start undoing the law administratively, but most of the action will lie with Congress,” said Chris Jacobs, a conservative health policy analyst who used to work for Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Many provisions of the health law are now deeply embedded in the nation’s health care system. Uprooting them would be a complex political and logistical challenge. Insurers now accept the idea that they cannot deny insurance, or charge higher prices, to people who have been ill.

And Congress may not move instantly to roll back the law without a clear idea of how to replace it — how to insure the 20 million people who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Moreover, the Trump administration will not be able to reverse unilaterally the expansion of Medicaid authorized by the health care law. Thirty-one states, including some with Republican governors, have expanded eligibility, with big infusions of federal money. Many of these states would balk at efforts to undo the expansion of Medicaid. The new Medicaid beneficiaries and health care providers, including hospitals, would also fight to preserve the expansion of Medicaid.

So the political environment could change immensely. Congress may spend months on hearings, debate and legislative maneuvering before making radical changes in the health law, on which public opinion has always been deeply divided. An army of lobbyists for doctors, hospitals, consumers, drug makers and insurance companies will descend on Capitol Hill to shape the legislation.

The requirement for most Americans to carry insurance — the “individual mandate,” enforced through tax penalties — is one of the most unpopular provisions of the law and is a prime target for Republicans eager to dismantle it. Republicans could also pass legislation to lift the requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to their workers, under the employer mandate.

It is not certain that Congress would repeal the health law in its entirety, but Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress could definitely shift direction, reducing the role of government in health insurance markets, cutting back federal regulation and requirements so insurance would cost less and no-frills options could proliferate.

Mr. Trump would encourage the sale of insurance across state lines, in a bid to increase competition. He and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have said they will convert Medicaid, now an open-ended entitlement, into a block grant, giving each state a lump sum of federal money to provide health care to low-income people.

And Mr. Trump would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and let people take tax deductions for insurance premium payments.

Economic Policy

Republican control of Washington sets the stage for a sweeping shift in economic policy. Mr. Trump has proposed a fairly standard set of conservative prescriptions, such as lower taxes and less regulation, with one notable departure: a promise to reduce trade with other nations.

The centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s plans is a major overhaul of the federal tax code. Mr. Trump has proposed a sharp reduction in the taxation of businesses and a series of changes that would reduce income taxes for most American households. The wealthiest households would see by far the largest reductions in taxes.

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that Mr. Trump’s plan would cut federal revenues by $6.2 trillion over the next decade — a significantly larger reduction than the last major round of cuts under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.

The plan reduces tax rates for most kinds of income. The top personal income tax rate, for example, would fall to 33 percent from 39.6 percent. The corporate income tax rate would fall to 15 percent from 35 percent. The resulting loss of revenue would be partly offset by eliminating loopholes and limiting deductions.

Such changes would require legislation, but Mr. Trump’s proposal shares considerable common ground with a plan advanced by House Republicans. And through budget reconciliation, major tax cuts — such as Mr. Bush’s — have been passed with simple majority votes in both chambers.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have insisted that these cuts would not increase the federal debt, in part because they say faster growth would increase tax revenues. Previous tax cuts, however, have not produced anything like the projected increase.

Mr. Trump has also promised to make deep but unspecific cuts in federal spending.

At the same time, however, Mr. Trump has said that he would like to increase federal spending on the military, and on infrastructure like roads and bridges.

An analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Mr. Trump’s plans would increase the federal debt by $5.3 trillion over the next decade, and raise the ratio of debt to gross domestic product to 105 percent.

Mr. Trump also has promised to reduce federal regulation. Business groups argue that the Obama administration has impeded economic growth by significantly expanding regulation in areas including environmental and worker protections.

He has specifically promised to reverse some new environmental rules, such as the climate change regulations on power plants. Earlier this year, he also proposed the “dismantling” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which overhauled federal regulation of the financial industry in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a likely target for Republican legislators.

Mr. Trump also has promised a major shift in trade policy. He says he will increase American manufacturing by reducing imports from China and other nations.

His victory almost certainly seals the demise of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the Obama administration negotiated with Japan and other Pacific Rim nations. Mr. Trump also pledged repeatedly to renegotiate or abandon existing trade agreements, notably the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which has increased American trade with Canada and Mexico. He also has threatened a variety of sanctions against American companies that move manufacturing jobs overseas, although the legality of such measures is unclear.

Republicans who broadly agree with Mr. Trump on taxes and regulation may have greater reservations about his views on trade. The party has long supported increased trade among nations. But Mr. Trump is the party’s new leader.

Even assuming the wrongdoers are identified, there are often jurisdictional hurdles because the thieves aren’t in the United States or in countries that will easily extradite them. Moreover, companies that are hacked are restrained in their desire for the criminals to be prosecuted because that means their own embarrassing breach will be in the news that much longer. In April 2014, the F.B.I. issued an alert that these sorts of attacks would only increase as providers moved from paper to electronic records.

A recent theft involving Anthem is a perfect illustration. Tens of millions of patient records were compromised, all were stored in a centralized database, none were encrypted, and no one has been caught. Anthem’s response was to send out letters to victims offering free credit monitoring. But credit monitoring isn’t an antidote for a breach of medical records. What good does a form letter do for someone whose most private data has just been stolen?

What’s the solution? For starters, disaggregation, meaning that medical data should be stored in individual or family units rather than in centralized databases. Such a regime would return the data to the person who should own it in the first place: the patient. Each individual or family would have medical data in a personal cloud or a digital wallet. Patients could then share their data how they choose: with family members, with researchers, with other doctors for a second opinion.

We cannot leave it to the health record software companies — the Cerners, Epics and Allscripts of the world — to bring about the needed changes. Their business is to sell proprietary information software to health systems to create large centralized databases for such things as insurance reimbursements and patient care. Their success has relied on an old, paternalistic model in medicine in which the data is generated and owned by doctors and hospitals.

Yes, giving consumers control of their own medical data would revolutionize who owns medical data and how it is used. Concerns about researchers losing access to this amassed data are overstated. Patients have shown an overwhelming willingness to share their information for altruistic reasons (which far exceeds the track record of doctors and health systems when it comes to sharing data).

The private and academic sectors are hard at work on a technology solution: one that is tamper-proof, ensures confidentiality and makes sharing medical data easy. One approach, known as a blockchain, is an encrypted data platform that would give patients digital wallets containing all their medical data, continually updated, that they can share at will.

We need to move on from the days of health systems storing and owning all our health data. Patients should be the owners of their own medical data. It’s an entitlement and civil right that should be recognized."

The student and part-time lawn-company worker had lost 20 pounds, could not shake a nagging cough and was sleeping 14 hours a day when he decided to visit a clinic in Muncie, Ind., that provides free care for the poor and uninsured. A clinic employee invited Mr. Kloski, now 28, to apply for Medicaid.

A few days later, he took his new coverage to the emergency room at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie. A CT scan found a 15-centimeter tumor in his chest, so big it was pressing on his windpipe. In May 2015, he learned he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a form of cancer that is curable if caught early.

The Affordable Care Act, and Governor Pence’s decision to go against many other Republican governors and expand Medicaid under the law, may well have saved Mr. Kloski’s life.

He is among more than 400,000 Indiana residents — many of them previously uninsured — who have enrolled in Medicaid since Mr. Pence expanded it in 2015, the 10th Republican governor to do so. Under the terms of the health law, anyone with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or approximately $16,500 a year for an individual, now qualifies in states that opt to expand the program.

IU Health says it receives more Medicaid payments than any other health care provider in the state. Since the expansion began, the percentage of patients with Medicaid has grown to 23.2 from 20.7.

At the same time, the percentage of IU Health patients who are uninsured has fallen to 2.2 from 5.

In 2015 alone, the health system enrolled 14,000 people in Medicaid or private coverage, sometimes even signing up patients as they lay in hospital beds.

“We went all in because it’s a pretty big deal to us,” said Jonathan W. Vanator, IU Health’s vice president for revenue cycle services.

In the first nine months of last year, IU Health officials said, the amount of bad debt owed by patients and referred to collection agencies totaled $233 million, a 23 percent reduction from the comparable period in 2015, thanks largely to Mr. Obama’s health law.

But, the officials added, these gains have been largely offset by cuts in Medicare reimbursements and other federal funds under a law that has given and taken away.

Mr. Murphy is among many hospital executives now anxious about the possibility of seeing a bump in uninsured patients if the health law is repealed, while not getting back the federal funds they gave up under the health law. “I do think it would be problematic if part of the deal was changed and not the whole deal,” he said.

Mr. Pence expanded Medicaid only after the Obama administration agreed to let Indiana do it in its own way: Instead of getting virtually free coverage, as Medicaid recipients in many other states do, people enrolled in Indiana’s expansion pay up to 5 percent of their income toward it. Mr. Trump appears interested in promoting Indiana’s “personal responsibility” model: He has picked its chief architect, Seema Verma, to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Since Mr. Kloski had no income when he enrolled, he paid $1 a month; he has since been classified as “medically frail” and does not have to pay anything.

Medicaid has paid for virtually all of his cancer care, including a one-week hospitalization after the diagnosis, months of chemotherapy, and frequent scans and blood tests.

But Mr. Kloski and his mother, Renee Epperson, are still not fans of the health law over all. They believed that it required that Mr. Kloski be dropped, when he turned 26, from the health plan his mother has through her job at Target — not understanding that it was the law that kept him on the plan until he was 26.

Mr. Kloski paid a penalty for going uninsured in 2014 rather than even explore whether he might qualify for a subsidy and find an affordable private plan through the marketplaces.

“There were so many horror stories about how expensive it was going to be,” Ms. Epperson, 47, recalled. “Justin said, ‘I’m not even going to try it, Mom.’”

And until they were interviewed for this article, the mother and son did not know that the law was responsible for the expansion of Medicaid that Mr. Kloski benefited from. Neither voted in last year’s presidential election; Ms. Epperson said that she disliked both candidates, and that even though Hillary Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act, she found Mrs. Clinton’s positions unacceptable on too many other issues, like abortion rights, to support her.

Still, she said, she ardently hopes that Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress will continue allowing low-income adults like her son to qualify for Medicaid.

“Oh my God, yes,” she said. “Absolutely.”

As for Mr. Murphy, IU Health’s chief executive, he said that while he did not want to think too much about changes that were still hypothetical, the prospect of losing the Medicaid expansion made him anxious.

“I worry about lots of things,” he said. “That list is probably 50 long, and this is definitely on that list.”"

More doctor visits, hospital stays, operations and pills mean more revenue and profit for health care providers. But the push in recent years has been toward what is known as value-based health care. In the value model, medical groups are paid for outcomes: patients treated more efficiently and people who are healthier.

But that transition only becomes possible with accurate, reliable data as the raw material for measuring outcomes and discovering what works and what does not. That is the reason for the excitement about and investment in health information technology, and the goal of the Medicaid work with Nuna. The data set will be stripped of identifying information before it is released to researchers.

Ms. Kim, 35, a former Google product manager, has firsthand experience with Medicaid. Her brother, Kimong, who is a year younger, is severely autistic. When he was 8, Kimong started having monthly grand mal seizures, which are characterized by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. The ambulance, hospital, doctor and therapy bills piled up. As a 9-year-old, Ms. Kim helped her Korean immigrant parents complete the Medicaid application forms.

“Our family would have gone bankrupt without Medicaid,” she said. “It saved us.”

The Medicaid system covers millions of working families, older people, children and people with disabilities. In fact, 40 percent of Medicaid spending goes to the disabled. Half of long-term care in America, mainly for older people, is through Medicaid. And nearly half of the children born in the United States are in the Medicaid system.

The trouble with traditional health data warehouses, specialists say, is that they resemble digital vaults. It is difficult and time-consuming to get information in or out, and only people with specialized skills can use them.

But the new cloud-based technology, using internet-era software, is flexible and interactive. It opens the door to real-time monitoring of emerging disease clusters, billing patterns and program effects. For example, did the percentage of low birth-weight babies decline after a Medicaid program was put in place? If so, how much?

“This kind of data can help move health care policy from a partisan ideological debate to one informed by knowing who the people affected are and what will likely happen to Medicaid recipients,” said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization.

Though young, Ms. Kim has spent years learning hard-earned lessons about health care. At Google, she was a product manager on Google Health, a failed effort to attract millions of people to use its free, online personal health records.

“Health care is hard, and humility is important,” Ms. Kim said. “You can’t just put technology on something and assume it’s going to work. You really have to understand the ecosystem in health care.”

In late 2013, Ms. Kim got a call from Washington and became one of the small cadre of Silicon Valley technology specialists called on to fix HealthCare.gov, the application website for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. That was six months of 18-hour days, seven days a week through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s and beyond, until the end of the spring 2014 enrollment period.

That government experience, Ms. Kim said, “paved the way” for Nuna’s work with Medicaid data. It demonstrated, she said, that internet technology and software methods could be applied to government health data from the mainframe era.

Her brother is still on Medicaid, and caring for him is a family affair. Ms. Kim lives with her parents and Kimong in Hercules, Calif., in the Bay Area, about 10 miles north of Berkeley. When excited, Kimong waves his arms. When frustrated, he bangs his head against a wall. He can be loud and disruptive when he is anxious, and the family has been escorted off a few plane flights. “He’s a challenge,” Ms. Kim said.

To relieve her parents, Ms. Kim takes Kimong with her to work some days. He can only say a few words, and one of them became the start-up’s name — “Nuna,” or “big sister” in Korean.

Nuna, founded in 2010, had only one full-time employee, Ms. Kim, until 2014, when it got an early round of venture financing. And no one was paid until then. David Chen, the company’s co-founder and chief data officer, holds a Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Stanford University, but he also was a data scientist at Netflix for three years while Nuna was getting off the ground.

Today, Nuna has 110 employees. It has raised $90 million in venture capital led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and prominent individual investors, including John Doerr, Kleiner’s chairman, and Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab.

Nuna is applying the technology and lessons learned from its Medicaid work to pursue business from private health plans, especially at large companies, to help them improve the efficiency and quality of care for workers.

Nuna’s technology achievement, specialists say, is impressive. Government research agencies and big health providers have put some data on Amazon Web Services, the leading cloud-computing supplier, which hosts the Medicaid data set. “But no one has tried to do something as audacious as Nuna has done,” said Andy Jassy, chief executive of A.W.S.

Ms. Kim expressed pride in her start-up’s work, but also a sense of personal satisfaction. “This is my love letter to Medicaid for saving my family,” she said."
327,1509,2017-02-02T01:33:00+0000,article,Donald Trump's Longtime Doctor Says President Takes Hair-Growth Drug,58928c5495d0e0392607e1d3,"persons:Bornstein, Harold N, persons:Trump, Donald J, subject:Hair, subject:Doctors, subject:United States Politics and Government",National,0.001537387,Politics,Dr. Harold N.

Bornstein granted the interview after The New York Times asked him to discuss his past and possible future role in Mr. Trump’s care.,"The disclosure that Mr. Trump uses a prostate-related drug to maintain growth of his scalp hair, which has not been publicly known, appears to solve a riddle of why Mr. Trump has a very low level of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a marker for prostate cancer. Mr. Trump takes a small dose of the drug, finasteride, which lowers PSA levels. Finasteride is marketed as Propecia to treat male-pattern baldness.

Dr. Bornstein said he also took finasteride and credited it for helping maintain his own shoulder-length hair and Mr. Trump’s hair. “He has all his hair,” Dr. Bornstein said. “I have all my hair.”

Dr. Bornstein, 69, has a private practice on the Upper East Side of New York, was educated at Tufts University for college and medical school, did his fellowship in gastroenterology at Yale, and was Mr. Trump’s personal physician since 1980. He said that he had had no contact with Mr. Trump since he became president, and that no one from Mr. Trump’s White House staff had asked for copies of the medical records that he has kept for the last 36 years, or called to discuss them.

Dr. Bornstein said that Mr. Trump had gone to his East Side office for annual checkups, colonoscopies, and other routine tests every year since 1980. Before that, Mr. Trump was a patient of Dr. Bornstein’s father, Dr. Jacob Bornstein.

At times in the interviews, Dr. Bornstein was moody, ranging from saying that Mr. Trump’s health “is none of your business” to later volunteering facts. He also meandered, referring to his longtime study of Italian and stories about medical schools floating cadavers to an island off the waters of New York. He said he liked the attention he got from friends now that he was publicly known as Mr. Trump’s doctor but disliked “the fun made of me” by the news media and strangers who have thrown objects at his office window and who have yelled at him on Park Avenue.

Dr. Bornstein’s first brush with the public was in December 2015, when he released a hyperbolic four-paragraph letter about Mr. Trump’s health.

“If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” Dr. Bornstein wrote. He offered scant medical evidence for his prediction beyond saying Mr. Trump had no significant illness and nothing that required treatment outside of his office. Eight months later, Dr. Bornstein stirred controversy by saying he wrote the letter in five minutes while a limousine sent by Mr. Trump waited outside.

A second letter in September 2016 was more sober, although it omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient’s health. The letter did say that Mr. Trump is 6-foot-3, weighs 236 pounds, has a normal blood pressure of 116/70 and takes a drug called rosuvastatin (marketed as Crestor) to lower cholesterol and other lipids.

Dr. Bornstein did not say how high the lipids were before the statin therapy, but he reported that the levels were in the normal range in recent tests: cholesterol, 169; HDL cholesterol, 63; LDL cholesterol, 94; triglycerides, 61.

In both letters, Dr. Bornstein wrote that Mr. Trump’s PSA level was 0.15. The low number led urologists not connected with Mr. Trump to say that he must have been treated for an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer. But Dr. Bornstein said in the interviews that Mr. Trump had had neither ailment and that his PSA level is low because of Propecia.

In the interviews, Dr. Bornstein said he refilled Mr. Trump’s prescriptions for a long-acting tetracycline, a common antibiotic, to control rosacea. The skin ailment can cause easy blushing or flushing with visible blood vessels. It also can spread over the face, and sometimes the chest and back. In different forms it can resemble acne and cause bumps.

Dr. Bornstein also addressed questions about Mr. Trump’s recent description of himself as a “germophobe.’’ Dr. Bornstein said he had never discussed that phenomenon with Mr. Trump, but “we are very careful to keep the examining rooms spotlessly clean, which we do anyway.’’ He added, “He always stands there and changes the paper on the table himself” after an examination. “Other than that, nothing.”

Dr. Bornstein said that he was sure that Mr. Trump was up to date on an H.I.V. test, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults get at least once. He said if he became the White House doctor he doubted that he would include in Mr. Trump’s annual checkup any psychometric tests as a base line for potential dementia. Mr. Trump’s father, Fred, suffered from Alzheimer’s disease in his eighties and a number of experts have urged that older political leaders undergo such tests.

Dr. Bornstein also said he had cared for Mr. Trump’s first and third wives, and occasionally for the second. “I am probably the only person in the world who has every phone number for him and all the wives,” Dr. Bornstein said.

About a month ago, Dr. Bornstein said he told Mr. Trump’s secretary, Rhona Graff, “You know, I should be the White House physician.” Past presidents like Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush brought their own doctors to the White House, but others have used a White House physician.

Dr. Bornstein was invited to Mr. Trump’s inaugural, although he said it was not as pleasant an experience as he expected. He had to walk a long way to a spot where he thought there would be a chair — he said he has a painful back ailment and nerve damage to a leg — but when he got there, there was no chair.

He stood behind a tree and “never heard anyone speak because I was so uncomfortable from my back and being cold.” He felt, he said, “absolutely miserable.” It seemed to take forever to leave because of the heavy security, he said. The situation was the same at an inaugural ball where there were no tables and chairs. So, he said, unable to chat comfortably with others, he and his wife, Melissa, returned to their hotel early."

It would give each state a fixed amount of money for each Medicaid beneficiary, instead of paying a large share of whatever it costs to cover everyone who qualifies. And it would substantially reduce the amount that the federal government pays to help cover the Medicaid expansion in Arkansas and 30 other states, a change that would most likely result in many people losing coverage.

In return, states would get far more freedom to structure their Medicaid programs as they wished. Now, even as divisions among Republicans in Congress slow efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Hutchinson and other Republican governors are developing proposals to require many Medicaid recipients to have a job, participate in job training or perform community service.

“It gives dignity; it gives responsibility,” Mr. Hutchinson said in a recent interview at the State Capitol. “And if somebody wants to say, ‘That’s not for me,’ if they’re able-bodied they ought to be kicked off the system.”

Work requirements have long been central to the Republican goal of instilling a sense of “personal responsibility” in people who benefit from government programs. But it was an Arkansas Democrat, Bill Clinton, whose embrace of work requirements for welfare recipients when he was governor became the basis for the 1996 federal welfare law enacted during his presidency.

In fact, 59 percent of nondisabled adults on Medicaid do have jobs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But advocates for the poor say low-income people often face numerous roadblocks in finding work. Some have criminal records. Others lack a cellphone or reliable transportation, said Mandy Davis, a social worker at Jericho Way, a resource center for the homeless in Little Rock.

“Middle-class America believes in work because we do it ourselves,” Ms. Davis said. “But we have resources, an education, transportation, a supportive family.”

Mr. Hutchinson and a few other governors, including those in Arizona, Indiana and Montana, have already sought work or job-training requirements for those who received Medicaid under the expansion over the last few years but were rebuffed by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama would allow them only to refer Medicaid recipients to job-training programs, with no requirement that they participate.

One early indication of the Trump administration’s stance will be whether it approves Kentucky’s request to require able-bodied Medicaid recipients to either work, enroll in school, get job training or volunteer 20 hours a week. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, submitted the request last year.

President Trump’s nominee to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, a health policy consultant, helped with the proposal. Ms. Verma has also helped other Republican states push for, and in some cases win approval of, new rules for Medicaid enrollees, including charging them premiums and temporarily revoking coverage from those who fail to pay the premiums.

It was Mr. Hutchinson’s Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, who got the state’s Republican-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid by using federal funds to buy private insurance for the poor. Mr. Hutchinson said in the interview that he wanted to continue the expansion here, but that if the federal government stopped paying most of the cost as the health law requires, “we’ll just have to look at it again.”

He said he would either seek the Trump administration’s permission to impose a work requirement or seek a block grant — and, with it, leeway to create new rules — to cover those who newly qualified for Medicaid under the health law.

As a rough model, Mr. Hutchinson pointed to a work requirement for certain food stamp recipients — a federal policy that was part of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul — that Arkansas reinstated last year. Under that rule, able-bodied adults without dependents cannot receive food stamps for longer than three months unless they are working, volunteering or getting job training for 20 hours a week.

States were allowed to suspend the requirement during the recession, but most have brought it back as unemployment has dropped. It generally applies to adults ages 18 to 49 unless they are pregnant, have dependent children or are medically certified as “unfit for employment.”

Since Arkansas reimposed the work requirement last year, its food stamp rolls have lost about 36,000 people, according to the State Department of Human Services. Mr. Hutchinson said the drop was partly explained because people had found jobs, but advocates for the poor said many appeared to have been cut off.

For now, Arkansas is sending letters to Medicaid enrollees to let them know they are eligible for “free job search assistance,” including career counseling and help writing résumés. The state is putting together a system to keep track of those who take advantage of the offer and whether they end up finding jobs. Many Medicaid recipients here already have low-paying jobs, but roughly 40 percent report having no income, according to the state.

“If you look at the statute, it is one of the purposes of Medicaid to help people attain independence and self-sufficiency,” said Dennis Smith, senior adviser for Medicaid and health care reform at the Arkansas Department of Human Services and a Medicare and Medicaid director under President George W. Bush.

But Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy for the National Health Law Program in Washington, said work requirements for Medicaid recipients would very likely be challenged in court.

“Applying work requirements to health coverage gets it exactly backward,” he said. “An individual needs to be healthy to work, and a work requirement may prevent them from getting the health care they need in order to be able to work.”

Christopher Caveney, 38, of Blytheville, recently found part-time work as a security guard after a long recovery from surgery to remove a benign tumor in his spine. Mr. Caveney has Medicaid coverage but lost his food stamps last fall because he was not working the required 20 hours a week.

“I went from being able to eat vegetables to eating Hamburger Helper every day,” said Mr. Caveney, who earns $10 an hour. “I think most people want to work, but I also know a lot of people work when it’s not necessarily in their health’s best interest.”

Mr. Cuello also said it would be difficult for states to determine which of their Medicaid enrollees were truly capable of work. Someone may be legitimately disabled but not yet approved for disability benefits, for example.

That is the case with Jimmy T. Brunson, 44, whose diabetes has caused painful neuropathy in his feet. Mr. Brunson, who was playing dominoes one recent morning at Jericho Way, a resource center for the homeless, said he sporadically found temporary jobs but had a hard time keeping them because of the pain in his feet.

Mr. Brunson said he had qualified for Medicaid under the health law and was using it to get his diabetes medication. If a work requirement was imposed, “I’d probably be out,” he said. “Even though sometimes I can get a job, you’ve got to understand — sometimes I can’t even walk.”

Daniel Foltz-Morrison, a Medicaid recipient who makes a modest income singing at churches around Little Rock, said he worried that a work requirement would reduce the Medicaid rolls without connecting many people to jobs or training.

“Are these work-force centers going to be robustly funded and have the means to identify prospective employers and make matches happen?” asked Mr. Foltz-Morrison, 29, who is also a graduate student at the University of Arkansas. “I worry that this is all for show.”

But even some of Arkansas’ poorest residents are quick to say public benefits should be conditioned on work.

“I’m glad we have it, but people should have to do something for it,” said Ms. Godinez, who had stopped by the Fishnet Missions Food Pantry in Jacksonville, outside Little Rock. “This is America, right? You’re supposed to work for what you get.”

Some who make a living helping the poor also said they were strongly against providing a public benefit to those who are physically able to work but do not.

“If you’re of able mind and body, you should be able to make something happen for yourself,” said Edward Brown, the daily operations manager at Stewpot, a soup kitchen in Little Rock. “But some people just don’t want to work — they’re too taken care of.”

Dewey Sims, the founder and chief executive of Fishnet Missions, which runs the food pantry here, agreed. “I ain’t got no damn entitlement,” he said. “I earned everything I got.”"

Ms. Graff is a senior vice president of the Trump Organization, and her unofficial role as a back channel to the president raises questions about whether Mr. Trump is skirting the Federal Records Act, which governs the preservation of schedules and correspondence from the president, something the White House denied in response to questions about her role from Politico.

Reached on Sunday, Ms. Graff declined to comment. “I like staying behind the scenes,” she said in a conversation last year in which she rejected a reporter’s proposal to shadow her for a day because so much private campaign, business and personal information crossed her desk. “We’re so intertwined when he’s here,” she said.

Or, as she once put it to Real Estate Weekly, “Everybody knows in order to get through to him they have to go through me.”

Ms. Graff, a Queens College graduate with a master’s degree in psychology, left a sports marketing job after college to spend more time at home with her ailing mother. Eventually in search of another job, she heard about an opening in Mr. Trump’s office, and in 1987 called cold. They hit it off.

Since entering the Trump Organization’s secretarial pool, Ms. Graff has acted as Mr. Trump’s media liaison, scheduler, sometimes spokeswoman, fund-raising planner, “Apprentice” co-star and Miss Teen USA judge. And regardless of who is taking Mr. Trump’s calls in Washington, it is Ms. Graff who occupies a more central space in the Trump orbit.

In 1991, during Mr. Trump’s brush with going broke, it was Ms. Graff, “my very loyal secretary,” as he put it in “The Art of the Comeback,” who came into his office to tell him that his estranged wife, Ivana, was on the phone with the message, as he put it in the book, “I vant my money now.”

In 1993, Mayor David N. Dinkins presided at the wedding of Ms. Graff to Lucius Joseph Riccio, the city’s transportation commissioner, and later nicknamed Professor Pothole by The New Yorker for pioneering the field of pothole analytics at Columbia University.

For decades, Ms. Graff worked under the tutelage of Mr. Trump’s longtime personal assistant, Norma Infante Foerderer, who died in 2013 from a heart attack after a difficult eye surgery.

“She’d still be here if she didn’t have that problem,” Ms. Graff lamented in Mr. Trump’s office last year.

“A disaster,” Mr. Trump agreed.

But by 2005, the year Ms. Foerderer retired, Ms. Graff was already ascendant in an office that loomed large among the nation’s secretaries. (A poll of secretaries by a staple company showed that Mr. Trump trailed only President George W. Bush when it came to the country’s imagined toughest bosses.) In 2004, Ms. Graff became a recurring character on “The Apprentice,” and in 2008, she was briefly listed as the secretary for a luxury golf course in Scotland before a Trump confidant, George Sorial, replaced her.

In 2013, she attained boldfaced name status in Page Six of The New York Post as “Donald Trump’s right hand.”

Since Mr. Trump has technically stopped running the Trump Organization, Ms. Graff now forwards messages to Mr. Trump’s personal assistant in the White House, Madeleine Westerhout, whom Ms. Graff helped train. Sometimes she forwards messages to Katie Walsh, one of the deputy chiefs of staff; a White House spokeswoman maintained that messages are routinely sent to an official point of contact, instead of directly to the president.

Mr. Trump’s dedication to his secretary and hers to him is much like the relationship Fred C. Trump, his father, had with his secretary, Amy Luerssen, treating her like family. He once had workers carry her up 12 flights of stairs when her elevator stopped working, lent her nephew his wife’s pink Cadillac when his car was stolen and would see her off at the airport when she went on a trip.

When Ms. Luerssen’s niece, Kathy Quigley, tried to bring her aging aunt down to Florida, she said Donald Trump and his brother, Robert, insisted that Ms. Luerssen stay until she was senile. “It was a little bit of a battle because I was thinking, ‘Gee, I’d really like her to be down here with me,’” Ms. Quigley said. “But she was very happy.”

When her aunt died in 2006, a death notice appeared in The New York Times that read, “The Trump family mourns the passing of our beloved Amy, a trusted and loyal friend and employee for over 65 years.”

Mr. Trump compared his father’s dedication to Ms. Luerssen to his own loyalty to Ms. Graff. “My father was very loyal to people,” he said last summer. “I think I am too.”

Ms. Graff was clearly touched.

“Well thank you boss,” she said. “Well it works both ways obviously. I’d never leave him.”"
333,955,2017-05-17T21:00:54+0000,article,"With Ransomware, It's Pay and Embolden Perpetrators, or Lose Precious Data",591cba0d95d0e024b5871642,"subject:Cyberattacks and Hackers, subject:Cyberwarfare and Defense, subject:Computer Security, subject:Bitcoin (Currency), subject:Computers and the Internet, subject:Extortion and Blackmail",Business,0.040646084,None,Thousands affected by the global digital attack must decide whether to fork out money to gain control of their computers or face losing their data forever.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/technology/bitcoin-ransomware-pay-lose-data.html,1205,Thousands affected by the global digital attack must decide whether to fork out money to gain control of their computers or face losing their data forever.,"Officials also note that the attackers, who have yet to been named, have provided only three bitcoin addresses — similar to a traditional bank routing number — for all global victims to deposit the ransom, so it may prove difficult to know who has paid the digital fees.

This haphazard planning has led many victims to hold off paying, at least until they can guarantee they will get their data back.

So far, roughly $80,000 has been deposited into the bitcoin addresses linked to the attack, according to Elliptic, a company that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies.

F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, has confirmed that some of the 200 individuals that it had identified, who had paid the ransom, had successfully had their files decrypted. Yet that represented a small fraction of those affected, and the company said it still remained unlikely that people would regain control of their computers if they paid the online fee.

The tally of ransom payments may rise ahead of Friday’s deadline, but cybersecurity experts say the current numbers — both total ransom money paid and machines decrypted — are far short of early estimates forecasting that the digital attack may eventually cost victims hundreds of millions of dollars in combined ransom fees.

“I predict this may be an epic failure,” said Kim Peretti, a former senior litigator in the Department of Justice’s computer crime and intellectual property division who now is co-chairwoman of the cybersecurity preparedness and response team at Alston & Bird, an international law firm. “Because of the publicity of this attack and the public’s awareness of people potentially not getting their files back, the figures aren’t as high as people had first thought.”

For victims of such attacks, the potential loss of personal or business files can be traumatic. In typical ransomware cases, including the most recent hack, assailants send an encrypted email to potential targets. The message includes a malware attachment that takes over their machines if opened. The attackers then demand payment before returning control of the computers, often through money paid into bitcoin or other largely untraceable online currencies.

Ransomware Attack: More Coverage

The latest ransomware strike, experts said, was particularly virulent because it was based on malicious software stolen from the National Security Agency. Law enforcement agencies from the United States, Britain and elsewhere have been tracking the potential culprits, with suspicions now focusing on hackers in North Korea.

For Randy Meyers, a technology consultant for a rural hospital in western Texas, the recent ransomware attack has brought back bitter memories.

Last month, Mr. Meyers discovered that a similar virus had taken over critical computers at a 25-bed medical facility in Fisher County, roughly a three-hour drive from Fort Worth. The virus locked physicians and other medical staff out of patient records, and his repeated pleas by email to the attackers to unlock the vital machines went unanswered.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Eventually, Mr. Meyers brought in cybersecurity experts to crack the malicious software, ensuring that the struggling hospital would not have to pay the roughly $18,000 in bitcoin ransom to retrieve patients’ files. Still, he said, the attack had crippled the hospital for four days, with doctors and nurses resorting to pen and paper.

“It’s like going home and finding out you’ve been broken into,” said Mr. Meyers, who said he had never before experienced such an attack in more than 20 years as a technology consultant. “You never want to have to pay the ransom. It gives them a reason to do it again and again.”

For some organizations, particularly government agencies, paying to decrypt locked-out computers is not even an option. In many countries, including across Europe and Asia, the payment of any form of ransom is forbidden by laws often written to counter terrorist attacks in the offline world. That means organizations like Britain’s National Health Service, among the worst affected in the recent ransomware attacks, are left with few options to retrieve data that can have life-or-death implications.

In the United States, there is no nationwide policy outlawing such ransomware payments. But experts still warn against handing over money because it may lead to far more significant costs down the road.

Exclusion and cooperation clauses in many cyberinsurance policies expressly prohibit businesses from paying such digital ransoms without pre-approval. If a victim hands over the money anyway, insurers may cancel a business’s coverage and leave clients paying out of pocket — including covering the cost of disruptions to their businesses, remediation expenses and customer notifications.

“In general, the advice is not to pay,” said Kevin Kalinich, a global cyber-risk expert at Aon, the insurance broker. “The perpetrators may not release your data, or you’ll be considered a target for future attacks.”

Jorge Reza, a sales manager for a construction business in Laredo, Tex., was forced to take that gamble when the company he works for was hit with a ransomware attack last year.

Hours after one of his colleagues was locked out of the business’s main computer, which held company invoices, payroll data and other sensitive information, Mr. Reza, 34, found himself online, researching how to open a bitcoin account and other tips for paying the digital ransom.

Despite fears the assailants would not unlock the computer, Mr. Reza uploaded money through Western Union, found someone who would sell him $1,200 worth of bitcoin and waited for notification that the machine had been returned to his control. The process, Mr. Reza said, was both stressful and uncertain, as he could not be sure the attackers would follow through on their promises. Luckily, less than 12 hours after the initial attack, he was able to decrypt his files.

“They were digital terrorists, but at least they were honest,” Mr. Reza said. “They were holding our data hostage. What other choice did I have?”"
