Re “If All Doctors Had Time to Listen” (June 7), which described approaches to trying to improve primary care:
The article looked at one model of care that seems unrealistic for a majority of Americans: the idea of doctors receiving a monthly cash fee from each patient, plus fees for office visits, without accepting insurance. Almost all patients who contact a new physician ask if their insurance is accepted as payment and, if not, look elsewhere. Cost, rather than quality, is their first concern.
This model also does not solve the problem of too much demand for too few primary care doctors; it would achieve the complete opposite, as only a fraction as many patients are cared for every day.

One necessary solution to our nation’s health care crisis is to increase the number of primary care physicians. This would allow all Americans to access doctors with the time to listen to their problems, rather than reserving that privilege for the lucky few.
Our organization of specialty-care physicians calls for increased reimbursement for primary care doctors as a way to increase their numbers and allow them to spend more time with individual patients, even if specialty-care reimbursement must be cut as a necessary spending offset. Our nation’s health is better served by a stronger primary care network than by paying its specialists so handsomely.

To the Editor:
It is wonderful that some medical doctors are able to convert the financial savings of using computerized medical records into more time with their patients.
But what about when patients appear at emergency rooms? Do their medical records readily appear on the E.R. doctor’s computer? Or must they wait for a fax with only partial records?
It is crucial that electronic records be standardized across the health care system.

If a new approach to the practice of medicine is called “patient centered,” what do we call the old one? I am sorry, but I thought that all of medicine was supposed to center its concerns on patients in the first place.
