What if I don't want my health
care dollars to pay for other
people’s abortions?
Abortion opponents say the legislation would use taxes to subsidize
insurance that could cover the procedure. Under the House bill, health
plans could choose to cover abortion, but they generally could not
use federal money to pay for the procedure and instead would have to
use money from the premiums paid by beneficiaries. Representative
Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, said the bill would keep
current restrictions on the use of federal money for abortion.
Will bureaucrats be allowed to
“pull the plug” on elderly sick
people, or euthanize them?
Will there be “death panels” to
decide who lives and dies?
No. AARP, the lobby for older Americans, says, “The rumors out there
are flat-out lies.” The House bill would provide Medicare coverage for
optional consultations with doctors who advise patients on
life-sustaining treatment and “end-of-life services,” including
hospice care.
Will undocumented immigrants
get taxpayer health benefits?
None of the major proposals in Congress would provide health
insurance to illegal immigrants.
Can the government deduct
money directly from bank
accounts to pay for health
care?
No. The House bill says that one of the goals for electronic health
records is to “enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow
automated reconciliation” between payment and billing. But it
describes common electronic banking transactions, not special
access privileges for the government.
