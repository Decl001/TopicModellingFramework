To the Editor:
Re “Carrots, Sticks and Digital Health Records” (Unboxed, Feb. 27), in which Steve Lohr described the promise and the challenges of moving to electronic patient data:
Dr. David Blumenthal, the Obama administration’s national coordinator for health information technology, noted in the column that two hospitals just a few miles apart view themselves as competitors and suggests that insurers will have to pay them to share data or penalize them if they don’t.
But in our competition-based health care system, insurers also view one another as competitors, and unless all provide incentives for the adoption of electronic health records, the fully networked health care system of the future will not be realized.
Federal government investment in health information technology, while a good first step, is insufficient to change hospital and physician behavior. Payment reforms and restructured health care delivery organizations are also needed, and will require a challenging mix of carrots and sticks.
The key ingredient, though, is government leadership. Without it, the United States will continue to lag behind other nations in its ability to provide affordable, high-quality health care.
