A missing compact disc containing confidential medical and personal information on 75,000 Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield members was recovered yesterday, according to Magellan Behavioral Services, a managed care company that monitors payments for mental health and substance abuse cases of insurers.

A spokeswoman for Magellan, Erin S. Sommers, said the company received a telephone call yesterday morning saying that the CD, which had been missing since January, was delivered by mistake to a residence in the Philadelphia area. The recipients contacted a Magellan office in Philadelphia, she said.

Magellan sent two security employees to identify the CD, interview the people who received it and take it to the office. “We have no reason to believe, based on our interviews, that there was any improper access to the evidence,” Ms. Sommers said.
