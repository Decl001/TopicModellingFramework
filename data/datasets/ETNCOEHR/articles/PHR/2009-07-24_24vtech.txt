The former director of the counseling center at Virginia Tech mistakenly took home the mental health records for the student gunman who conducted the worst campus massacre in American history, the director’s lawyer said Thursday.

When he left his job at the center in February 2006, a year before the killings, Dr. Robert C. Miller accidentally put some of the mental health files relating to the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, in a box he packed with his personal documents, according to a statement released by Dr. Miller’s lawyer, Edward J. McNelis III.

The discovery of the documents, which Gov. Tim Kaine announced Wednesday, raised new questions about the rigor of the state’s investigation of the shootings on April 16, 2007, when Mr. Cho killed 32 people before turning the gun on himself.

Mr. Kaine said a criminal investigation was under way to determine how Dr. Miller was able to take the records out of the center, which is illegal, and why the documents had not been found earlier.
