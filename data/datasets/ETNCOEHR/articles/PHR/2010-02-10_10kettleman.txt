SAN FRANCISCO — State health officials said Tuesday that there was no evidence of a single cause for a series of birth defects in a central California farming town that is adjacent to the largest hazardous waste landfill in the West.

The initial findings from the California Department of Public Health stem from an investigation ordered last month by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. He had voiced concern about a handful of birth defects, and the deaths of three infants, that occurred in children born in 2007 and 2008 to women who had lived in Kettleman City.

The potential cluster of birth defects also drew the attention of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which last week visited Kettleman City, a town of about 1,500 people in rural Kings County. Agency officials also toured the 1,600-acre Kettleman Hills landfill, which contains toxic chemicals and other waste and is four miles west of the town.

Despite fears of an environmental cause, the health department said Tuesday that its initial investigation had determined that the rate of birth defects in Kettleman City from 1987 to 2008 was only slightly higher than that of neighboring towns and in surrounding counties.

The chief deputy director of the state health department, Kevin Reilly, said an analysis of medical records and other data showed “no patterns to suggest there was a common underlying cause” for the defects, which included cleft palates and other abnormalities.
