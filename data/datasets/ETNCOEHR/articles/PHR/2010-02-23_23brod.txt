Dr. Litvin, now an internist at the Medical University of South Carolina who teaches doctors how to improve care using electronic records, pointed out that the Veterans Health Administration has used its computerized patient record system for the past decade, and its doctors report that it has greatly improved the care of some eight million veterans. Prescriptions, laboratory tests, studies, consults, reports and progress notes from all visits by patients to any Veterans Affairs hospital are stored in each patient’s electronic record.

With privacy constraints in place to prevent unauthorized access to electronic health records — a requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 — patients could get electronic copies of their own medical records and have them sent directly to a doctor, hospital or other designated recipient.

Currently, however, the various hospital and medical groups that have gone electronic “speak different languages and cannot transmit information between systems,” Dr. Atul Gawande, the Harvard-based surgeon and the author most recently of “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right” (Metropolitan, 2009), said in an interview. “Integrating the systems so that we can send information across the country is the holy grail.”

The Benefits

A digital account of one’s medical records can do far more than relieve doctors’ dependence on unreliable memories. It can also have these benefits:

?

Avoid duplication of tests, from blood tests to M.R.I.’s. If you’ve already been tested recently by one provider, the results can be accessed electronically by another doctor within the same system. This can sometimes be life-saving in a crisis situation. If a test has a built-in hazard, not having to repeat it enhances patient safety. Or if a test must be repeated, the doctor can see immediately whether an important change has occurred since the last test.

Reduce medical errors. Within a hospital system, having a record of complications that accompany a particular procedure can help the system identify and rectify the problem before more patients suffer needlessly. An electronic system could reduce pharmacy errors that result from misreading a doctor’s prescription and misplaced decimal points and warn of drug allergies and potential drug interactions in individual patients. If a drug is recalled, with an electronic record every patient on the drug can be alerted quickly.

Make surgery safer. Dr. Gawande said he had just finished four operations, each of which had more than two dozen things to do or think about afterward, like lab tests, blood clot checks, antibiotics, bed arrangements, nursing instructions and so forth. When he and his colleagues had to rely on memory, some important steps were usually forgotten. But with an electronic reminder all now get done.

Encourage better self-care. “Well-informed patients are better able to participate in their own care,” Dr. Steven Shea of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons said in an interview. If patients have access to critical parts of their health records, especially their test results, they may be “more likely to engage in healthy behavior and more likely to bring symptoms to the attention of their doctors,” Dr. Shea said, adding, “In my experience, the better informed patients are, the more efficient and productive the medical visit can be.”

Improve care of chronic illnesses. Fewer than half of patients with chronic ailments regularly take prescribed medications or get the periodic checkups their doctors recommend. An electronic system can alert the physician to noncompliance and when it is time for another office visit. Electronic reminders and prompts can help patients get better preventive care, Dr. Litvin said, like when they should have a colonoscopy, get a flu shot or get certain lab tests. Electronic records may also help to reduce waste in the system by identifying the most effective treatment regimens for common conditions.

Identify the right drug and dose. In the not too distant future, as DNA-based variations in drug responses are identified, electronic records will enable doctors to choose the most effective medication and dose for each patient. For example, in determining a safe and effective dose of the blood thinner Coumadin, months of risky trial and error could be eliminated by tailoring the dose to each patient’s unique genome.

The Concerns

Privacy concerns have been the main deterrent to “wiring” medical records. But Dr. Litvin notes that the information is password-protected, and that insurers and employers would not have access to a patient’s electronic medical record unless the patient authorized it. “The benefits to providing quality medical care way outweigh any privacy issues,” she said.

As with any innovation, there is a learning curve associated with establishing and using electronic records. “There was a lot of pain in adopting an electronic system,” Dr. Gawande said. “But now that it is up and running, none of us would go back, not for a minute. A well-designed system can dramatically improve medicine’s ability to get better results.”
