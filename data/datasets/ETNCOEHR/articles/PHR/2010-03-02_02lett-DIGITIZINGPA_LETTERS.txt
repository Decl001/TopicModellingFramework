Re “Medical Paper Trail Takes Electronic Turn” (Personal Health, Feb. 23): Good medical records are the foundation of good care, and electronic medical records, if widely adopted, will ensure ready availability.

Regrettably, the quality of records is not vouchsafed by electronic records. Their use inhibits face-to-face contact of patient and doctor, and they too frequently form a checklist of symptoms lacking a coherent synthesis of the patient’s illnesses and rationale for treatment. Electronic records facilitate billing and record storage, but the crucial content of the medical record must come directly from the doctor-patient relationship and not the computer.
