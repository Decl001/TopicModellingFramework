Abigail Wark wants to see your areolas.

But only if you are a participant in the Personal Genome Project, a research effort to find 100,000 volunteers as research subjects in the public domain — contributing data from their genomes, microbiomes, health records, tissues and more.

The project comprises 16 research groups that want to study different aspects of the data. Scientists from each group are meeting on Tuesday in Boston with a group of 150 volunteers whom the project’s executive director, Jason Bobe, calls “omic astronauts,” from the “ome” in words like genome. This is the fifth annual GET conference; the initials stand for genomes, environments and traits.

“We’re prototyping a legal and technical infrastructure for sharing data,” Mr. Bobe said.

The project started in 2005 with 10 volunteers, called the P.G.P. 10, including noted scientists like the psychologist Steven Pinker, the technology expert Esther Dyson, and the project’s founder, the geneticist George M. Church.

Since then more than 3,360 participants have enrolled and the genetic data for more than 600 have been posted online. Ultimately, the data could be used to answer countless questions about the body; the immediate goal is just to collect the data.

Dr. Wark, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Tabin Laboratory at Harvard Medical School, studies variation in the human areola, the circular patch of differently colored skin around the nipples. “One of the wonderful things about a process like GET labs,” she said, “is instead of asking single-trait, single-gene questions, we can say, ‘Let’s look at everything we can collect about breast biology.’
