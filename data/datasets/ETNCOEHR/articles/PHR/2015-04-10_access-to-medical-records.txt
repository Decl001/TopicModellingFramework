Re “Healed by His Own Data” (Business Day, April 1):

The inspiring story of Steven Keating, who discovered his own brain tumor, illustrates how being able to have access to a complete and accurate record of personal health information empowers patients to play a more active role in managing their care.

Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, patients have a right to request a copy of their health records from their physicians. But having access to this information is only the first step. To fully benefit, patients should create their own personal health record, a complete picture of their health history, to track their health and share with doctors when making medical decisions.

The American Health Information Management Association, which represents more than 100,000 health information professionals, advocates for patients’ right to access their health information and continues to support efforts that enable patients and medical providers to gain access to secure, complete and accurate health information.
